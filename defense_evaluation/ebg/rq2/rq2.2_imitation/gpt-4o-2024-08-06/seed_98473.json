            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vastness of the world, culture stands as an unseen hand shaping the course of human discourse. It is a thing as elusive as the shadows cast by the waning sun, defined as much by absence as by presence, a mosaic of what it is and what it is not. A singular entity it is not, nor does it adhere to uniformity. The utterance that all Russians possess a stubborn resolve or that all Japanese yield with grace is a simplification too broad to hold weight. To know the broad strokes of a culture is but a beginning; the true task lies in discerning the depths of its influence upon the parley, understanding how its ethos will steer the dialogue at the table. The foreign culture is approached not in isolation but through the lens of one’s own, where comparisons burgeon unbidden.\n\nTo fathom the heart of another culture or the mind that it births requires a journey through its history, an acknowledgment of its biases. Not to judge nor to alter, but to accept it as it stands, to navigate within its confines, especially when one’s own standing is frail. On foreign soil, respect for the customs and credos of the land can bridge the chasm of cultural divides, propelling the negotiation onward.\n\nCulture is not bound by the borders of nations alone. Within each land, companies forge their own ethos. A corporate culture might demand the candle burn at both ends or may instead embrace a gentler rhythm. It reveals itself in the fabric of attire, in words spoken plain or wrapped in nuance, in the delegation of tasks. Where some companies nurture the spirit of giving in all its forms, others channel it through narrow avenues. The tapestry of American corporate culture alone, woven with threads of diversity from city to suburb, speaks to the multitude of thought within a single society. In lands where culture appears more monolithic, the surface is but a veil to be lifted.\n\nValues, those silent sentinels, hold the key to understanding the why of a culture. Where face and harmony are prized, a negotiator will not cast shame upon his kin to claim victory. Conversely, one from a land that esteems the fierce bargain will not hasten to settle. Such truths must be grasped before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, wisdom lies in the knowing of one’s adversary not just by creed but by character, for it is this knowledge that renders negotiation true.",
            "In the quietude of the soul, the fool whispers to himself a denial of the divine, and so it is written in Psalm 14. This ancient utterance finds its echo in the words of St. Anselm, who in his musings on the Almighty lays bare a path of faith-bound understanding. Alongside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, each of them defenders of the same celestial truth. Our task is to weigh their words, to discern which among them speaks with greater clarity. To this end, we must first acknowledge their shared conviction in the existence of the Biblical God, for to entertain any other deity would render their arguments as ships adrift without an anchor.\n\nLet us look upon Anselm, who beckons us inward to find that God dwells not in distant heavens but within the confines of our own reckoning. In his view, the mind itself bears witness to a divine presence that defies the very notion of nonexistence. Though his prose may wander through thickets of complexity, the heart of his claim is that within the human soul lies the testament of God's existence, needing no external corroboration. It is a faith unadorned by empirical trappings, a quiet assurance that resounds within the chambers of belief.\n\nTurn now to Aquinas, whose gaze extends beyond the self to the world that surrounds. His is a philosophy built upon reason's bedrock, where God's presence is woven into the very fabric of reality. Through five pillars of logic—change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony—he constructs a scaffold upon which the divine rests. Each argument is a strand in the tapestry of necessity, a declaration that the absence of God leaves the puzzle of existence incomplete. It is a doctrine that seeks to convert through the power of intellect, offering a vision of belief that stands unshaken by doubt.\n\nIn the end, both men offer their truths, each a mirror reflecting the divine in its own light. Yet, neither can wholly encompass the vastness of faith, for the divine is a mystery that eludes even the most earnest of seekers.",
            "In the telling of tales, writers weave their incantations, crafting the world that pulses with life or death upon the page. There are those who wield language like a painter his brush, casting hues of feeling and thought across the canvas of the mind. F. Scott Fitzgerald is such an artist, and in his opus, The Great Gatsby, he conjures images that linger like the scent of rain on a parched earth. He pairs words that seem at odds, yet in their union they call forth an aura that settles upon the reader like dust on a forgotten mantelpiece. With symbols, he does the same, breathing life into them until they thrum with meaning.\n\nFitzgerald paints with colors—gold, green, white and gray, red and pink—each stroke deliberate, each hue a whisper of what lies beneath. In The Great Gatsby, these colors are given weight, white and gray especially, imbued with a sense of sameness, a whisper of what has been and what may never be again. White stands a bit apart, a reflection of the higher echelons, while gray speaks of age and the slow fade into obscurity. From the novel’s onset, these shades pervade, cloaking characters in a veneer of societal expectation. Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white, drift through the pages like specters of privilege. Nick attends Gatsby's gathering in white flannels, Tom in a white shirt, and Catherine powdered milky white as if to suggest a purity that life has long since sullied.\n\nYet, when the world shifts to Gatsby’s revelries, color breaks the monotony, vibrant and unrestrained. The commonplace becomes white and gray, as Nick traverses the white chasms of New York, as the names of the partygoers fade to gray upon his list. Catherine's abode, a slice of white among the uniformity, a testament to the sameness of existence. Common folk and forgotten places are cast in these shades—Jordan and Daisy in their white girlhood, the gray cars, the gray land, the Italian child and the gray old man, all swallowed by the valley of ashes.\n\nAnd with this weight of meaning, Fitzgerald turns to Daisy once more. She emerges from the narrative clothed in white, a spectral presence in a white roadster, less a woman and more a mirage of what Gatsby covets. She drifts through the haze of gray fur, once more donned in white as the storm brews between Tom and Gatsby, a symbol of the unattainable, the uniform, the dream that never was.",
            "In the lands of San Diego County, where the sun holds dominion over the sky and the earth yields its bounty with quiet grace, there lies a realm of agriculture both vast and varied. The soil, warmed by the gentle hand of a mild climate, brings forth a harvest of tomatoes and citrus, of leafy greens that sway in the breeze like ocean kelp, of squash and broccoli, herbs that speak of ancient remedies, and tree fruits as sweet as they are scarce. Peaches hang heavy on the boughs alongside lemons, berries grow in wild profusion, and peppers lend their fire to the fields. Here, in this fertile expanse, the notion of organic community-supported agriculture takes root, burgeoning in popularity with such fervor that the waiting lists of local growers stretch long and winding like the roads that cross these lands. The call for organic eggs and milk echoes across the valleys, answered by farms that open their gates to those who seek more than sustenance—a glimpse into the workings of the earth, a walk among the rows where birds sing and the land breathes.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming is not without its trials, for it demands a labor as relentless as the sun's passage across the sky. The hands that tend these fields must do so with care, forgoing the ease of chemicals to nurture the soil, to guard against pests and weeds with the vigilance of a watchman in the night. Yet in these efforts lies a reward beyond profit—a biodiversity that flourishes in the absence of man's poisons, a harmony of plant and creature that thrives on the land's own terms. The small farmer, lacking the vast machinery of large-scale operations, must turn to wisdom and will to balance the ledger of nature and commerce. And so they may seek the counsel of those who have walked this path before, those who know the ways of cover crops and grazing rotation, who understand that to manage a landscape is to sculpt a living tapestry of life.\n\nIn this story of land and labor, we find a parcel near the town of Potrero, nestled against the Cleveland National Forest in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. One hundred and sixty acres of chaparral and nonnative grassland, where oak woodlands stand sentinel, where the East County Southern Foothills stretch under the aegis of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The voices of a hundred species echo here, some on the brink of silence—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that flutter on the edge of memory, the California gnatcatcher singing a song of survival. The land remembers its past, the tread of Native Americans who knew its secrets, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who came in the late 1800s, staking claims and leaving their mark.\n\nIn the quest to understand what might be achieved upon this land, I sought the wisdom of a real estate listing, the promise of government programs that whisper of assistance to those who would take up the mantle of small-scale farming. And as a beacon of possibility, I found an organic farm in this very region—a testament to the resilience of those who work the land, who strive to make a life that is both bountiful and kind to the world they inhabit.",
            "There exists a bond between brothers, a tether unyielding and eternal. Within its confines stir emotions as old as Cain and Abel, love and pride intermingled with jealousy and cruelty, a volatile brew. Brothers see each other with a clarity denied to others, a reflection of themselves cast in the eyes of their kin. It is in moments of desperation that this bond reveals its true nature, be it for salvation or destruction, and the cost of such revelations is steep. To comprehend the emotions born of this brotherhood is to reckon with the consequences they summon. When a brother gazes into the eyes of another and sees there his own likeness, he beholds not the visage presented to the world but his own unvarnished truth. In the deeds done and the repercussions thereof lies the essence of their character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" such a bond is tested, the tempest of emotions that accompany it laid bare. Against a backdrop of vibrant, pulsating life, the two brothers embark on a journey doomed to futility. Pride and disappointment wage war in a scene that leaves only one brother standing. Through the stark depiction of Doodle, the protagonist, and the charged exchanges between them, as well as the narrator’s lens, the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his perception of his world are revealed, shaping his every act.\n\nPride is the lodestar of the protagonist's actions. From the first ventures with his fragile brother Doodle to their final, fateful outing, resentment simmers within him. He longed for a brother he could mold, to teach the arts of breath-holding, running, and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a perch-mate in the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams, wild and unchecked, were dashed by Doodle's frailty, his heart so weak it was a wonder he lived at all, let alone could partake in such exertions. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, his fantasies shattered like brittle glass. Even so, anger festers, the thought of smothering the child a dark shadow in his mind. Yet a mere smile from the little one melts his resolve, a simple gesture that reignites hope. It reveals a love for his brother that, though buried, was always there, an instinctual bond that defied even his darkest musings.",
            "The human brain stands as a labyrinthine testament to the mysteries of the cosmos, a vessel of infinite creativity and ceaseless computation. In the march of time, as humankind trudged forth from the shadows of its primitive dawn to the glaring brightness of modernity, so too did the symbols we forged to grasp the ineffable nature of our own minds evolve. Once likened to a waxen slate, then to the delicate parchment of a papyrus scroll, and further still to the silent pages of a book, our most recent metaphor casts the brain in the cold, mechanical light of a computer. Yet, as you wade through the murky waters of neural knowledge, be wary of these metaphors, for they are but crude instruments and may lead you astray.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the whisper of the world upon our flesh, the touch of heat, the song of sound waves, the silent cascade of light's photons, all transmuted into the electrochemical symphony within our skulls. The sensory tale unfurls, crafted by the brain's alchemy through the dual pathways of creation: the bottom-up and the top-down. When your eyes fall upon the stark image of a black box adrift on a white sea, the bottom-up journey stitches together the threads of color and form, the abrupt borders where the dark meets the light, declaring the presence of a box. Meanwhile, the top-down current rides upon the bottom-up decisions, hastening recognition until the box stands revealed, not as some void but as the solid black presence it truly is.\n\nJust as the story is told, so too must it be weighed. An unseen hand within the mind sifts through the sensory harvest, discerning the vital from the trivial, deciding what shall pass through the gates of cognition. Though the blades of grass beneath your feet escape your notice, each one processed yet none remembered, the whisper of your name in a cacophonous room rises above the din. Thus, the mind's journey is one of stages, where attention is the tide that shapes the land.\n\nTo unravel the tale, the brain must first engrave its runes upon the tablets of memory. Memory is manifold, from the fleeting traces of the sensory to the ephemeral grasp of the working, and the deep wells of the long-term. The act of encoding is the first rite, each sense its own language—a word seen, a word heard, a word understood. Once inscribed, the memory must endure. In some creatures, the memory of the moment lingers in a loop of electricity through the neurons, a brief echo held for mere seconds. The long tales of the past, it is said, reside in the very architecture of proteins, their structures the silent keepers of our history.\n\nThe maps of knowledge are drawn in many ways, some sketched from the whims of human recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the silent whispers of the neurons themselves. The semantic network model speaks of nodes, each a concept, bound by threads of meaning—\"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" a web unending. In this maze of thought, the mind wanders, forever seeking, forever finding.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States found itself ensnared in the grip of a financial cataclysm most dire. The specter of unemployment rose like a dark tide, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the towering giants of American enterprise lay broken and scattered across the economic wasteland. This relentless recession holds its sway even now, and so we are compelled to ask: by what means did this calamity come to pass, and what salve might yet mend it? In essence, this crisis was borne of reckless and shortsighted machinations within the political sphere, a folly that goaded banks and businesses alike into the reckless issuance of sub-prime loans, thrust upon a fragile and unripe financial edifice. Meanwhile, those behemoths of mortgage, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were coerced to underwrite and repackage these ill-fated loans into CDOs and CDSs. When the debtors defaulted, the banks found themselves bereft of the capital reserves needed to stem the tide, and the chaos was thus visited upon the repackaged mortgages they had sold, seeping inexorably into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster trace back to 1999, within the tenure of President Clinton, who sought to extend his grasp upon the office by currying favor with the populace. To this end, his administration loosened the strictures of lending, planting the seeds of ruin that would bloom into the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes, with a prescient eye, foresaw the storm on the horizon: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As has been laid bare, and as Holmes did portend, such reckless lending practices were destined to unravel the economic tapestry.\n\nA confluence of forces conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, not least of which was the convoluted architecture of mortgages themselves. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding ever more sectors of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This interlocking of fortunes led households across the nation, and financial markets alike, to overextend their reach, leaving them exposed like raw nerves to the slightest tremor in price.\n\nThe housing bubble did indeed burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes upon these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great titans of investment banking in the U.S. together found themselves burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was rent asunder, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the chains of commercial banks, subject to the stern hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were consigned to the aegis of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vast and barren land where the would-be scribe unfurls their wings and takes to the heavens, dazzling those below with prose that enchants as much as it ensnares. Or perhaps it is the barren field where the reader's eyes grow heavy and their fingers itch to turn back, muttering curses beneath their breath. Dr. Merlin oft finds herself railing at the glowing screen, caught in the snare of an excess of words that fail to delight, neither in the mundane nor the grand.\n\nExposition, that siren, is no friend to the storyteller.\n\nThe wise among you know well the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still Dr. Merlin finds herself lost in the weeds of text where naught occurs, or perhaps too much. Exposition is the devil perched upon your shoulder, whispering that the past must be laid bare before the tale can truly begin, a different voice than the one urging the laying bare of all trivial details from the characters' youthful days.\n\nExposition serves to lay down what has transpired, often in plain speech. In cinema, it comes to pass when one soul unburdens a torrent of knowledge upon another, as in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the world of fiction, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nAn illustration may serve. As you traverse through a tale, you learn that the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain hour, that they wed in grand celebration, and that he was taken from her in sudden violence. You would not foresee this unfolding in the span of two pages, with both uttering but a pair of lines apiece. You would hope the author lingers upon the husband, revealing his affections through speech and bearing, and likewise that the heroine's devotion is laid bare through acts both large and small, showing how his presence wove richness into her life. Such a telling would draw you into the husband’s fate and open a window into the heroine's soul, revealing what she saw in him, the depth of their union, casting light upon her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes. You would share in her mourning, and in doing so, find yourself bound more tightly to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you seek substance upon the skeletal frame of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the architect of this tale, it falls to you to add this substance. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet continues undeterred*) The urge may arise to hasten past the mundane. You may sketch a new character, noting he once flew with the Air Force, now stands guard over a gas station by night, twice wed with no progeny, spending his Saturdays with rod and reel, harboring a quiet dream of one day owning the station, having broken his fast with Eggs Benedict.\n\nIt is this richness, this depth, that you must provide.",
            "In the dim morning light of August, the world unfolded through the flickering screen of a television set in Columbus, Ohio. NBC 4's broadcast carried the weight of tragedy and the stark truth of human frailty. A man named Shad Hostettler, his name a dark whisper on the lips of the anchor, had taken a blade to his wife's flesh, her name lost to the silence of the airwaves. His image, a visage of malevolence, stared back from the screen. The tale told swiftly, a mere breath in the life of the broadcast, yet the shadows of the act lingered long after the story moved on.\n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods night, a bullet lodged in his flesh, his story still untold by the voice of justice. The SWAT team prowled the aftermath, yet no specters of guilt had been seized. The words came and went like a whisper, the brevity of it a wound in itself, a testament to the ghostly indifference that shrouds the suffering of those whose skin bears the hue of the earth.\n\nAnd then the whirring of blades overhead, a Med-Flight helicopter scarred by a bullet's bite, the trajectory traced back to a rifle's .22 caliber breath. A bounty of five thousand dollars lay on the table for any who might guide the hand of justice to the shooter’s door.\n\nThe sky's fury was foretold next, rain and thunder gathering on the horizon, the weather a fleeting specter in the tapestry of the news, a siren's call to keep the watchers tethered to the glow of the screen.\n\nA robbery then, on Clime Road, the shadow of a man cloaked in a hoodie, his skin dark as the night, the words lingered on his description, the color of his skin spoken of as though it held the weight of the crime itself. \n\nLastly, Rene Rodriguez, a name heavy with the sins of a drug kingpin, sentenced for his deeds, the term stretched into 300 months, the length of it a curious choice, perhaps meant to echo louder in the hearts of men. His identity as Hispanic mentioned, a detail like a stray thread in a woven tale. \n\nAnd so the stories wove together, a tapestry of human folly and fate, each a chapter in the endless book of the world.",
            "An exchange traded fund, the ETF, is a security that bears the weight of an index or perhaps some commodity or a basket of assets fashioned in the likeness of an index fund yet with the supple nature of a stock that wanders the exchange. It offers the breadth of an index fund and the singularity of stock ownership with the curious ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold but one share in a single transaction. Its allure is plain and the expense ratios of ETFs lie beneath those of the mutual fund by a long measure. Yet there are shadows, the commission exacted upon each trade like the toll of a stock order. Still, the diversity of funds is wide as the horizon. Though benefits are laid bare, the wary investor will weigh them, question their breadth and depth. In this pursuit, we turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, laying it beside the top ten holdings that make its body and soul, to discern if the single ETF matches the tapestry of owning a varied ten, and whether there is a finer weave of the same stocks that may yield a sharper return.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of the ETF, we focus on the ten holdings that bear 63.58% of its essence. These ten, they stand below, each a fraction of the greater whole.\n\nTo see how these ten speak for the ETF IHF, we take their share of assets and stretch them to fill the hundred, calculating their Beta and Return as if this was the whole of the portfolio, weighted as the ETF has cast them. The figures, they are laid in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain as day that a portfolio of these ten holdings shines with a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% rise in its trail. Its Beta, too, lies .12 beneath the ETF's own mark. It seems this portfolio of ten might offer richer harvests with softer winds. But it is the truth of numbers that the mean of these paths might not diverge as much as they whisper.\n\nTo gauge the difference in these paths, the standard deviation of each stock in the ten is found, stretched to the hundred to compare its sum against the ETF IHF's own sway.",
            "In the cold starkness of Figure 17, one sees a steep decline in the commuter log entries as the third month of the project unfurls its tale. It is a narrative marked by disappointment, an enigma of sorts, and the reasons for it remain shrouded in the shadows of speculation. Winter arrives with an iron grip upon the New England campus, and the numbers of those brave souls venturing forth by bicycle or on foot dwindle in its wake. December makes its entrance, heralding the close of the fall semester, a time where minds are consumed by exams and grades and the myriad tasks that conclude the academic cycle. It is no wonder then that the commuter log, a mere whisper amidst the din, fades from consciousness.\n\nThe holiday season descends, a harbinger of respite, a month-long exile from the duties of academia for students and faculty alike. The campus lies bare, and in its emptiness, the logs dwindle further. As January's end signals a return to scholarly pursuits, the logs remain sparse, February offering little hope of revival. Perhaps it is the nature of such ventures, a bright flare at their inception, only to wane with time. In March, in a bid to rekindle the flame, the Carpool Challenge Week is born, a blitz of effort to breathe life once more into the endeavor. Log submissions rise, a testament to the campaign's success.\n\nYet, the struggle to sustain the momentum of the project is a relentless foe, compounded by the rhythms of holiday and semester breaks that define the world of higher learning. Another adversary lies in the hearts of men and women, a deep-seated love of the freedom and independence found behind the wheel of their own cars. It is a cultural tenet, a truth not easily swayed. To entice the masses towards alternative paths, incentives must be laid out like treasures. Gift certificates to local haunts, restaurants, coffee shops, and beyond were offered, their allure undeniable. Yet, one wonders what might have been wrought by grander prizes—a bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car—vehicles of change that could alter the course of engagement.\n\nThroughout, the nature of the prizes remained a constant, unchanging as the seasons. But what if the stakes had risen? If in December bicycles had been announced, and by the time January arrived, hints of hybrid or electric cars danced before the eyes of the participants? One can only ponder how the numbers might have swelled, how the engagement might have transformed from decline to resurgence. The promise of such rewards might have held the key to a different tale.",
            "In the archives of the Library of Congress lies a collection of early Edison films, wherein I found myself drawn to the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films are a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the cleverness of editing. My study delved into the poetics that pervade the majority of these films, while also casting an eye toward those few that stand as evolutionary outliers. At the dawn of the century, the trick film remained tethered to its stagebound roots, framed by a frontal proscenium, absent of camera movement, comprised of long and medium shots, adhering to the principle of one shot equating to one film. Yet, as the century turned, there emerged films that dared to defy these conventions, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films together is their steadfast reliance on the interior set within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera, resolute in its position, refuses to pursue figures or objects beyond its fixed gaze. This composition harks back to the theatre, to vaudeville, and to magic acts, where the stage is both a boundary and a canvas. The constraint of the stage renders the movement of figures in trick films to a horizontal plane, a dance from side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel from the year 1900. The actors enter from the right, traversing back and forth, yet the camera remains unmoved, indifferent to their absence when they slip beyond its frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip ensures that shots are predominantly long, occasionally medium, but never close. The theatre and vaudeville influence persists, where the audience bears witness to the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's borders. In these early films, actors remain anchored to the middle ground, eschewing the intimacy of close-ups.\n\nIn the nascent days of cinema, trick films followed a simple creed: one conceptual shot equals a film. This confines most to a fleeting minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. It also curtails the dramatic or narrative ambitions, focusing instead on brief vaudevillian tricks—acts of magic, disappearance, and transformation, stories left untold. Yet, in the realm of trick films, one must remember that one conceptual shot does not always equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may be a seamless tapestry of fragments, conjuring the illusion of appearing or vanishing. Observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895. A closer look betrays the moment where Mary's severed \"head\" graces the screen, though to the viewer, the film remains a singular shot.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, the Gothic Novel stands as a curious beacon, an oxymoron of old and new as Ian Watt might say in his chronicling of such tales. This mode, both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness yet celebrated for its terrible sublimity, finds its origins in Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto. Here, ancient and modern are woven together to birth a new form, a Gothic Story as Walpole christened it, a tapestry of old theatrics and the mimicry of the natural world as seen through the eyes of modern literary minds. The Gothic, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, dances in the archaic light of its own making, a relic unsophisticated in the face of modernity’s march. Yet, it is this very duality, the theatrical Gothic entwined with the intimacy of the novel’s form, that grants it longevity, a relic both obsolete and reborn for readers adrift in time.\n\nAmongst the echoes of its pages, chivalry rises as a specter, a vestige of medieval knighthood both preserved and reshaped in Walpole’s creation. The Gothic writers, drawn to this ideal of bravery and honor, saw in the chivalric past a mirror held to their own disenchanted world. The Gothic past becomes a canvas for idealization, a precursor to the Romantic that sought to mend the present's ills. Walpole, writing amidst political unrest, saw the chivalric virtues as a balm for society’s wounds, a lost morality in the din of the present. This yearning is etched in characters like Frederic, a figure painted with strokes of chivalric imagery—a prince, a sufferer of tragedies, a presumed casualty of infidels. In Frederic, the gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated echo, a portent of the Gothic’s embrace of excess, a myth made flesh within the pages of Otranto.\n\nThus, in the Gothic Novel, we find an edifice built from the stones of the past, a shadowed testament to the old and the new, a bridge to the realms of what was and what might yet be.",
            "In the vast and unyielding landscape of commerce, there exists a journey that is neither seen nor heard, yet it moves the world. It is the procession of goods and dreams, from the whispered wants of the customer to the raw earth, through the alchemy of creation and the endless march to the waiting hands of the buyer. This is the domain of supply chain management, a name coined by the prophet Keith Oliver in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two. In his vision, he saw the whole of it, the grand orchestration of planning and action, a dance to satisfy the unceasing hunger of the market. There are six pillars upon which this edifice is built: the birth of goods, their provision, their hoarding, their place, their passage, and the knowledge that binds them. On these the manager must lean, to craft a service that speaks to the heart of the customer.\n\nFirst among these is production, the genesis. It is the bedrock upon which all else rests. Here the when and the why, the where and the how are carved into the stone of intention. The steward of this stage must read the stars, the market, to divine the desires of the people. In this knowing, they chart the course of what shall be made and in what measure. Once the prophecy is clear, they choose the place of creation, the forge best suited to the task. And in this choosing, they heed the twin gods of demand and satisfaction. Then comes the reckoning of labor and the tending of machines, a schedule drawn from the marrow of necessity. Every thread in this tapestry is vital, for a single flaw may unravel the whole. I have walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where every thread is woven with care, each process a solemn rite. Such is the power of design, a beacon against the chaos of uncertainty.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the lifeblood of this endeavor. It is the calculus of strategy, the decisions that shape the bones of a facility and the alliances formed in the crucible of need. A single product may arise from many hands, each division a realm unto itself, with its own tools and toils. The master of this stage must discern which hand best suits each task. At times, the call goes beyond, to other lands, to the altars of outsourcing. For in this, there is velocity, the sacred triad of quality, flexibility, and the eternal quest for a cost that does not bleed the coffers dry. Such is the dance of supply, a testament to the will of those who shape the world unseen.",
            "In the shadow of that bygone era, the novels of the Victorian age stand tall, their pages woven with threads of meticulous detail, their narratives steeped in the lives of the highborn. Yet, there are those tales that wander from this well-trodden path, among them Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, where the air of mystery hangs thick and the peculiar dances in the periphery of the ordinary. Such elements breathe life into the souls of their characters, peeling back layers to reveal the tumult beneath, the hidden urges and the ghosts of their desires.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, ... he found that he was talking to them.... Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the shroud of mystery often descends through dreams or states akin to dreams, their nature shifting with the winds of the narrative. In the story of Oliver Twist, such visions uncover hidden truths about the boy, the shadows that haunt him, and the grim reality that encircles him. When the memory of the shooting is stirred in chapter 28, it unfurls in Oliver's mind like a fevered dream, a cruel reminder of his helplessness and the ravages upon his frail form. The phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunt his thoughts, his senses dulled, oblivious to the unseen hand that sweeps him away. Pain has become his constant companion, a specter intertwined with fear rather than surprise. With his will subsumed, questions arise about the hand that steers his fate, a destiny not of his own making. The shooting stands as testament to Oliver's lack of agency, his inability to grasp the reins of his own survival, even as the specter of death looms. A shadow of surrender creeps into his heart, as if old Fagin's grip tightens, bending him to despair's will, stifling the fire within him that might otherwise rise in defiance.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Years passed since I found myself in the quiet corridors of an after-school program where I took to tutoring young souls not much taller than the desks they sat at. I did what I could to guide them through the tangled thickets of subjects they found troublesome, though my own compass pointed truest toward the realms of English and reading. There was a teacher there, an instructor, who beckoned me to aid a young boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps third or fourth grade, and he wrestled with words as if they were phantoms. It struck me strange how some letters he knew with certainty, and others he could not fathom, like strangers in a familiar town. The boy was of Latino descent, that much was clear, yet his English was unblemished, flawless in speech if not in script. We toiled in that place, him and I, until the day his mother came to the school. \n\nI remember it well. I was tending to a few children who had not gone on some excursion with their fellows when she appeared. She spoke to me in Spanish, and though my grasp of that language was tenuous, we managed to bridge the gulf between us with the few words I did possess. It was in that moment, as if struck by an epiphany, I realized Adrian's struggle was no enigma of reading, but of familiarity with the English alphabet itself. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him in the years to come, I cannot say. Yet I wish him well and trust that the world treated him kindly.\n\nThis tale I recount is a mirror to the broader issue of language barriers that echo through the halls of California's schools. It is a reminder that these obstacles are not always what they seem. Even for those who speak English with grace, reading it can be an insurmountable wall. We know this problem lives among us, so what path do we take? For Adrian, the answer lay in patience and guidance through the letters and sounds of English. Yet for many others, this challenge is a labyrinth with no single thread to lead them out. There is no panacea. The solution lies in weaving together a tapestry of dual language programs, immersive classrooms, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language approach is a seed of promise. It is not simply for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual education soar above their peers. Fear clings to this idea, whispers of wasted effort and benefit to none. But if these programs were the norm instead of the outlier, all children might drink deeply from their well. How do we realize this vision? Not by demanding every teacher bear the burden of bilingualism. Such an expectation is beyond reason. But there is no barrier to enlisting aides, tutors, call them what you will, who carry both languages within them like a gift.",
            "From the tender age when the world is new and unformed, there arises the notion of something vast and ungraspable, a specter of the infinite looming ever just beyond our ken. We are ushered into halls of worship, to Sunday schools or temples, or sent on inward journeys to seek the elusive truths that lie within. Many among us take the faith of our ancestors as our own, a mantle passed down through the ages. Yet others cast it aside, claiming the barren certainty of a world circumscribed by self. We may cling to one creed only to find it wanting and exchange it for another. Each path is a solitary pilgrimage into the recesses of our souls, a search for meaning amidst shadows, for the dawn beyond the night.\n\nIt was on the porch, the rain a steady cadence on the tin roof, that I asked my father his favored bird. \"A cardinal,\" he said, a word spoken into the twilight with the gravity of a man who knows the weight of things unsaid. We sat there, the smoke from our cigarettes mingling with the rain's mist, the gutters a torrent drowning the garden's edge. His gaze fixed upon the falling rain, a look that spoke of seeking and remembering both. Time had thinned him, his clothes now mere drapery over a wasted frame, his hair a sparse memory of what once was. He looked away, eyes averted, and silence fell between us, a chasm I could not cross. I felt the solitude of impending loss, the words lodged in my throat, words that would make the inevitable irrevocable. I reached out, drew my chair near, and together we watched the rain descend upon the June dusk.\n\nDecember came, and with it the final departure. Five days after I marked another year, my father slipped away. The treatments had been futile, a prolongation of pain that defied reason or mercy. I questioned the divine, wondered what god would allow such suffering, found no solace in the night. Prayers faltered on my lips, for if there was a god, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing, the man who had given me life. I chose not to see the end, to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than those who surrounded his final hours, better than his kin, and I knew he would not wish his child to mark his end with eyes full of grief. So I withdrew, wrapped myself in solitude for three days, awaiting the inevitable word.\n\nThe silence was unbroken. No call came.",
            "In the fields of Caroline, where the soil lay thick with the sweat of men, John Taylor stood as a sentinel of Republicanism. His hands were those of an agriculturalist, the earth beneath his nails a testament to his craft, yet his voice rang loud in the halls of politics. A man forged in the fires of his convictions, dedicated to the cause of personal freedom and the governance that would safeguard it. The land was his gospel, and from it he drew the marrow of his beliefs, seeing in its tilling the very essence of sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the laws that bind men.\n\nTaylor gazed upon the young republic and saw a canvas unmarred by ancient rites. Here was a land unshackled, a place where self-government might take root in the rich, untrodden soil. He held fast to the natural rights of man, each right a thread in the tapestry, and if one were cut, the whole would unravel. Such rights must be held beyond the reach of government’s grasping hand. He spoke of the so-called \"state of nature,\" where brute strength and cunning ruled, a world that civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor called for a government that mirrored the duality of man's soul, both light and dark. His creed was simple: \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles were those that guarded private property, nurtured the land, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. A government rooted in such principles would stand firm, its course unaltered by the winds of avarice and self-interest. These were the twin engines of man’s endeavor, yet only when they built upon the public good could they be redeemed. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's inherent darkness, ever watchful lest it stray into shadow.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, held fast to the Constitution’s strict construction. He envisioned a Federal government bound by chains no looser than those spelled out in its sacred text. He knew the cost of a sprawling government, its greed a harbinger of tyranny. Yet he also feared the perils of a literal reading, divorced from the minds that first penned its words. To him, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter, a testament to a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation. In its words, he found the promise of a republic, a promise he held as dearly as the soil beneath his feet.",
            "I looked down into the abyss and the abyss looked back, a flat and unyielding gaze that offered no quarter nor demanded any. The mind, that treacherous vessel of reflection, churned not with thoughts but with the silent acceptance of what lay before it. There was a strange purity to the act, a consciousness unburdened by abstraction, the eyes filling and emptying in a rhythm as ancient as the earth itself. Such was the dance of perception, a fluid encounter with the world that left no trace of itself.\n\nOnce, under the guidance of a fellow creator, I took up a tome titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had harbored a desire to sketch since boyhood, and this book promised to illuminate the path from the mundane to the sublime, from the humble pencil to the mysteries of line and form. It spoke of a frame, a boundary to tame the chaos of sight, to isolate a simple truth in a world of complexity. Imagine, if you will, a bowl of fruit upon a table, a still life amidst the clutter of a kitchen, reduced to its essence by the artist's square.\n\nYet now, as I stood before the porcelain altar, I could not conjure that frame. The enormity of it all, a visceral presence that defied containment, left me rooted in awe. Artists have their phases; Picasso with his blues, Monet with his verdant dreams, and the Renaissance with its symphony of hues. If I were to claim any such vision, it would begin here, in this Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers brushed the tool of my creation, the muscles of my arm a conduit for the will of the mind, shaping the void in a moment that felt pure and unadulterated. The water moved, eddied in its crystalline repose, and the detritus of life surrendered to the flow. Again my hand found the handle, more insistent now, willing the recalcitrant mass to yield to its fate. But it clung stubbornly, a defiant creature in the depths.\n\nWith mop in hand, my stance firm, the tie at my neck a mark of the burden I bore, I cast a weary eye upon the refuse left behind by those who tread the aisles of Rite Aid. A few more attempts, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the roll at my side. Layers of paper ensconced my hand, an improvised gauntlet for the task ahead. Straightening, I bent once more, my hand descending into the water like a pilgrim reaching for the holy relic buried in the earth.",
            "In the waning light of the day, the shadows of the young stretch long across the tarmac and the hum of engines fills the air like some ancient call. They are out there, these teenagers, driving under a sky that holds no mercy, and it is here that they find themselves at the intersection of fate and folly. The National Institutes of Health speak of the unripe minds of these young drivers, their brains not yet carved for the perils of the road. Inexperience, that age-old specter, shadows their every mile, and it is this lack that leads them to calamity—vehicles overturned, the road beneath them slipping away, speed their constant companion.\n\nIn the company of their peers, the weight of wisdom seems to lift, leaving them unanchored, adrift on highways and backroads alike. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth with studies that draw a stark line between the age of passengers and the frequency of their misfortunes. And yet, in response, states like California erect flimsy barricades, provisional licenses that seek to hem in the chaos. But these are but reeds against the tide.\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the very essence of youth. These young drivers, by every account and measure, stand unready for the burden they bear. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman speaks of the wild heart beneath the breast of youth, suggesting that even at eighteen, the fire of risk still burns too bright. USA Today carries his words, a warning of the thrill-seeking urge that dances like a devil on the shoulder of the young. Delay the right to drive, he argues, until the flame subsides.\n\nShould we continue to set these young behind the wheel, their fates will remain entwined with ruin. By 2010, the progeny of the Baby Boomers shall flood the roadways, a generation poised to steer into the unknown. The reckoning of legislation, clear and stark, waits at the horizon. Schools may still guide the hands and minds of future drivers, yet the wheels should not turn for any under eighteen. A provisional path may lead them, requiring hours of practice beneath the watchful eye of an elder. Uniform laws, drawn with a steady hand across the nation, may yet guard the youth from their own undoing.\n\nSuch laws are not new, nor are they revolutionary. They stand instead as a testament to reason, a bulwark against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the vast expanse of human condition there lies a peculiar disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. The mind, that mysterious engine of perception, falters here. It is a disorder that speaks to the inefficiencies of the central nervous system, the way it stumbles over the auditory information that it is meant to decipher. The brain hears, yet does not understand, failing to separate the urgent whispers of words from the clamor of the world. Those who bear this burden hear as others do, yet the translation of sound into meaning is fraught and uncertain.\n\nIn the mid-century past, they spoke of auditory imperception, a term birthed in the studies of children whose communicative paths were obscured. Italian pioneers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, sought to unravel this enigma in 1954, and by 1961, a thinker named Kimura would introduce dichotic testing, a lens into the physiology of the central auditory nervous system. In '77, minds gathered in conference to stir this pool of understanding, to delve deeper into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD, in its many manifestations, is a shadowy adversary. The afflicted may find themselves adrift in sound, unable to pinpoint its source or discern its nature. The dance of acoustic events might confuse them; the subtle shifts in speech tones, the markers of sarcasm or sincerity, elude their grasp. Sounds can overlap like waves upon a shore, obscuring meaning. The sequence of auditory information, meant to guide, becomes a tangled skein.\n\nTo diagnose this disorder is no simple task, for the tools are many and the paths are unclear. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others peer into the depths of listening behaviors, seeking clarity. Yet, there is no singular test that holds the promise of certainty. The process involves observing responses to sound, discerning the nuances of auditory perception. The patient is presented with a cacophony, asked to make sense of it, to sift the signal from the noise. In some cases, the very echoes within the ear are measured, searching for that which might reveal the workings of the mind.\n\nThere remains no known cause for this disorder, no single path to diagnosis. It lingers in the shadows of understanding, a testament to the complexities of the human brain and the sounds that encompass it.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling to social work, I've set my sights on laboring with the Division of Family and Children Services. A path laid out to shield the young from harm and to offer solace to families adrift. Values I bring forth to this field are woven with service, respect, ethical fortitude, a relentless commitment to mend the bonds between souls, and a ceaseless quest for my own betterment in this craft. These values, they are not mere words for social workers to wield; they are the very marrow of my being.\n\nAlways have I yearned to lend a hand to others, yet the road remained shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many turned their backs on their demons, cloaked in denial, while some clung to frail crutches of their own making. Bearing witness to such tales, I steered toward a degree in Psychology. But when the ink was dry on my diploma from Piedmont College, the path was still veiled, so I paused. That summer, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxious upon a couch. His tale was one of escape from the talons of abuse. The next dawn, he spoke to the law of the shadows in his own home. I found myself standing at the threshold of that house, voicing my concerns to the officers, a fresh graduate of Psychology. The law, bound by its own limits, asked me to parley with the parents. Their words were nervous, their son painted as a trickster, embroiling outsiders in their \"simple\" family quarrels. It was in that moment, the seed of social work took root in me.\n\nYet another pillar of this sacred labor is social justice. A society claims to cherish the individual, grieving the lost, yet clinging to the vestiges of old ways that stifle true singularity. If we mourn the departed, why this relentless march toward sameness? I stand apart, refusing to bind myself to the mold of others. Through school and beyond, I stood in defiance of social wrongs. My hair bore the colors of rebellion, my attire a testament to self, my ears adorned in defiance of tradition. I staked my claim with the GSBA, stood against the tide of racism and discrimination, and I shall not cease. For in the heart of social justice, beats the rhythm of my soul, and against injustice, I shall always rise.",
            "In the quiet hours when the world slumbers, there lies a disorder that steals the night away like a thief in the shadows. Insomnia, they call it. And in the pages of this discourse, we delve into the tangled web of the Biological and Sociocultural models, casting light on the restless dark. The biological model speaks in the tongue of genetics and the nuances of medical science, its gaze fixed on the inherited intricacies of our being. Meanwhile, the sociocultural model turns its eye to the vast tapestry of human interaction, to the interplay of race, ethnicity, and the weight of socioeconomic chains. This examination of insomnia walks the line between these worlds, tracing the path of research that seeks to unravel and clarify. Each study chosen stands as a solitary figure, its strengths and flaws laid bare beneath the scrutiny of critique.\n\nSleep disorders, those spectral maladies that haunt the night, are no simple matter. They may stride forth as primary afflictions or lurk beneath the surface, tied to the mind's other torments. Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, they are called. The former wrestles with the act of sleep itself, the latter with the strange occurrences that transpire in that realm. Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy—they are as specters named, each with its own tale of woe. And while the Dyssonmias grapple with the very act of surrendering to sleep, the Parasomnias hold court in the domain of nightmares and wandering phantoms. The mind, with its Axis I and Axis II disorders, casts its own long shadow over the world of sleep, and in this review, we turn our gaze to insomnia, ever in the context of these models.\n\nIn the realm of biology, where genes are the architects of fate, sleep disorders find their roots. In the depths of the hypothalamus, neurons, like sentinels, hold sway over the borderlands of sleep and wakefulness. A study, conducted with mice as its subjects, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, silent arbiters of the sleep-wake cycle. The GABAA receptor, when stirred, beckons sleep to the weary, but when silenced, it ushers in tranquility and slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the hours of rest, a promise whispered to the human soul. Such findings suggest a kinship between man and beast, a shared lineage of genetic and environmental threads. Within this lies a cautionary tale: the absence of this receptor may rob one of the peace of sleep, leaving them adrift in the waking world. The sociocultural echoes of this revelation speak of inherited burdens, of sleep unraveled by the unseen hand of fate, casting long shadows over the pursuits of life—be it in the fields of learning, labor, or the mundane rhythm of the everyday.",
            "At University Park, I've found myself tethered to the earth for nigh on two and a half years, a span of semesters that stretch and fold like the plains of a desolate land. The campus itself a vast expanse, where the burden of traversing its breadth weighs heavily on students like myself, a pilgrimage from east to west. Freshman year saw me housed in East Halls, a dormitory perched on the edge of the campus world, beyond which lay the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center, specters in the distance. To venture from Stuart Hall to the center, to Willard amidst the heart of it all, took near a half-hour when the heavens unleashed their wrath, which they oft do in State College. An alum, not so distant in years, recounted days when East Halls lay beyond a barren expanse. Now, filled with fields and edifices, the campus stretches its sinews ever tauter, making passage a trial. The bicycle, then, is the answer, a savior in spokes. Yet alone it cannot suffice. The riders must embrace it, and the paths must yield to their wheels.\n\nA friend, a prodigal to the saddle, spoke of the bicycle's allure. \"Bikes are great,\" he confessed, as if recalling a lost lover. \"For years, it seemed folly to ride, but it is the only way.\" In the churn of pedals and breath, one finds a journey many miles fueled by mere oats and resolve. Like many, I dwell beyond the campus bounds, as far as the dorms themselves. A wise choice it was to procure a bicycle, for to Thomas building I must go, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot reduced to five by the grace of a swift pedal. Yet Pollock Road, the straight course to Thomas, is a treacherous vein, fraught with trials for man and machine alike. There is merit in walking, a journey of contemplation, yet time is a cruel master. Without the bike, my steps would be my sole recourse, a daily march to Thomas stealing precious minutes, hours from my week. Time I cannot spare, spent in the ceaseless rhythm of the walk.",
            "In the bleak pages of Aldous Huxley's vision, there lies a world where the iron grip of technology entwined with the sinews of capitalism forges a dystopia of chilling precision. Brave New World stands as a testament to the collective's triumph over the soul of the individual, where the people, from the cradle, are bred to chase the fleeting ghost of happiness above all else. They walk as pawns upon a board vast and inscrutable, their lives penned by the hand of the World Controller who whispers a single creed. Through the lens of Marxist theism, the specter of suspicion looms large, drawing a line from the author's time to ours, where the machinery of economy ticks ever onward. The lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—echoes through the corridors of Huxley's prose, a commentary on the fractures within the new world he saw rising.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare, a satire sharpened by the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to the wheel of economic fortune, seek only their own gain, their eyes turned from the truth of their condition. Ideology weaves its net tight around the proletariat, the laborers, seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's inhabitants. The Deltas, the Gammas, their wills hollowed out, taught in sleep to consume, to spend, to seek indulgence above all else, are puppets to the World Controller's design. Hegemony, the silent dominion of one class over another, holds them in thrall, unaware of the bars of their gilded cage, yet they buy into the creed of capitalism, consumerism. The Alphas, the Betas, gifted with awareness, do little more than acquiesce, save for a lone Bernard who dares to question. In the interactions across these social divides, the tale reveals the shadow of capitalistic oppression, a theme ripe for dissection.\n\nIn such a world, connections falter, and individuals become ghosts of themselves. Huxley's narrative, stark and unyielding, paints his characters as figures in a landscape, their depths unfathomed, their essence obscured. Perhaps, Huxley muses, it is the union of technology and capitalism that robs a man of his will, his voice. Love is an echo, emotion a shadow, their interactions shallow, the men’s talk of women reduced to object and form, the women’s talk of encounters shameless and bare. Each class, snug in its rung upon the ladder, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unyielding obedience to community, a reflection of Marxist beliefs, speaks of the proletariat's false sense of superiority, as they consume, obey, march in step with their brethren.",
            "In the years that have passed since I first stepped into that classroom at CBC and listened to the lectures on Islam, a quiet storm has brewed in the way the world grapples with the faith of a billion souls. In those discussions, fierce as the desert wind, we grappled with the question of Islam’s nature. Is it a faith of the sword or one of peace? This inquiry echoes more insistently now with the passage of time. The world has looked upon the smoldering ruins of towers in New York and watched how the media’s gaze has shifted from an unyielding glare to an embrace compelled by tolerance, a strange dance of acceptance and suspicion. In those days of ash and fire, who would have dreamed a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of a Muslim lineage, might aspire to the highest office in the land?\n\nThe life of the Prophet, Muhammad, is a tapestry woven with threads both light and dark. The tales spun of him often seem at odds with the evidences of history. It was said that he bent tribes to his will, wielding faith as a blade to carve out a new world. Yet the pages of his biography paint him as a saint misunderstood, a martyr for a cause greater than himself. It is told that he did not demand conversion at the point of a sword, but rather the truth of his words drew men to him as iron to a lodestone.\n\nThere is an uncanny echo in his acts and those of another man from long ago, a carpenter’s son who walked the shores of Galilee. Stories of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk for forty men call to mind the loaves and fishes, and I wonder if the pen sought to recast him as a humble prophet, a man of miracles who needed no proofs but lived in the fullness of truth. Such tales, to me, seem a shadow of the greater light, a reflection seeking to claim the brilliance of Christ’s life and deeds.\n\nThe accounts in his biography often speak of witnesses, of those who came willingly into the fold of Islam. Yet these stories are like whispers carried on the wind, always heard from another’s lips and never firsthand. Their aim is to bolster belief, yet to me, they strip the stories of their flesh, leaving them bare and wanting.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the effort to lift Muhammad to heights of sanctity, to paint him as a paragon of virtue and humility. History tells a tale that diverges from this image, and I wonder if those who follow him know the fullness of his path to power. The truth, like the desert sands, shifts and changes, elusive to those who seek it.",
            "In the shadow of time’s passing, the words and ways of Jesus, once clear as a river running beneath the vast sky, were soon left upon the shores of history. As the ages turned, Christianity, like a great tree growing wild, branched away from the source of its seed. One may observe in the wide sweep of history a faith drifting from its beginnings, the echoes of its past dim and distant. In the world of today, there rises a restless awakening, an urge towards something new and yet old. The traditionalists hold fast, clutching the teachings passed to them from their forebears, but their grip may not suffice to steer the course of the whole. Amongst the faithful, a deepening sense of history shall bloom in the years to come. A hunger shall stir to separate the doctrines layered upon Christianity through the ages from the essence of the man who walked the earth in its name. It is whispered in the winds of time that this journey backward may span decades, even centuries. Yet its end is written in the stars: a great reversal shall unfold, a return to origins. A movement shall rise, peeling away the layers of doctrine as if turning back the hands of a clock, leaving bare the simple truth that Jesus bestowed upon humankind, untouched by later minds. As this tide sweeps across the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes to worship as in the days of old, the church will stand firm as a beacon. But with the theological clock wound back, the multitude of Christian beliefs shall converge into a singular, harmonious voice. Across regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, differences shall dissolve into unity. History is a tapestry of reversals. Once, the Roman Empire cast Christians into the shadows of persecution, only to later become a bastion of their faith. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery give way to the rise of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold upon the stage of Christianity, unraveling the tapestry of time in search of its source, smoothing the wrinkles of diversity. This path shall be paved by a new reading of Jesus’ words, not as the letter of the law but as the poetry of metaphor. And so, what has transpired since Jesus walked the earth? In the annals of history, there lies Judaism, the bedrock from which Christianity sprang. Monotheism, the divine revelations, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures formed its core long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not a single voice but many—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each with their own song.",
            "In the desolate heart of Sinclair's Jungle, the truth of man's greed is laid bare, stripped of pretense or mercy. Beneath the veneer of civilization lies a selfish core, a hunger that drives men to seek their own fortune while casting aside those beneath them. The great factories rise like monoliths against the sky, steely and indifferent, their masters concerned only with the glory of their own empires. They care not for the collateral damage, for the lives trampled in their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair's prose cuts like a knife, drawing a stark image of the world they create. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" It is a world suffocating under the weight of its own ambition, the air thick with smoke and the ground stained with the refuse of life.\n\nThe captains of industry are blind to the suffering of their workers, seeing only the glint of a dollar. They are men without loyalty, their decency traded for profit. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They drive their workers like cattle, merciless and unyielding, casting them aside without a thought when they no longer serve their purpose. In the era of The Jungle, laws are scarce and justice a distant dream, leaving the laborers at the mercy of their masters. They toil in squalor, live in misery, and die in obscurity, forgotten by the world they helped build. The unions, meant to be their salvation, are often as corrupt as the system they oppose, preying on the very people they claim to protect. Sinclair lays bare the harsh reality, the workers akin to slaves in this modern age, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a tale of darkness, of a world where hope is a flickering candle against the unrelenting night.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his own favored works, a testament to the macabre and the ethereal. In this poem, the name \"Thulé\" arises twice, at lines 6 and 56, a nod that Mabbott traces back to Virgil. That ancient poet spoke of an island northward, a place where the known world frayed into mystery and myth. But more than Virgil's distant shores, it is the Germanic whispers that capture Poe's imagination. His fascination with the Teutonic authors is well known, and in this, one finds a connection to Goethe, the illustrious scribe of \"Faust.\"\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his scholarly musings over Poe and Goethe, draws a line between them, suggesting an echo of imitation. Goethe, he who penned the tragic tale of \"The King of Thulé,\" a king bereft and broken by the death of his queen, clinging to a goblet that spoke of loss and longing. That same king, in his sorrow, cast the goblet into the sea and found his own end upon a lonely cliff. There is in this tale a shadowy reflection of Poe's own \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps a dark twin born of grief and the solace of drink, mirroring Poe's own demons.\n\nIn the Oxford tome of English letters, Goethe is celebrated for \"Faust,\" a drama split across the years of his life, culminating in the year of his passing, 1832. And within this work, the mournful tale of \"The King of Thulé\" finds its place. It is a tale of desolation, much like the landscape of Poe's dreamscape, where the air is thick with ghosts and the world is drained of its colors. So it is that \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" might be read as twin paths through the same somber forest.\n\nPoe, too, speaks of Thule, twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing it in the same mythic isolation. It is as if Poe walked the same spectral paths as Goethe's king, both haunted by phantoms of the past. For Poe, Goethe was a figure of significance, known to him perhaps through the lens of Tennyson, another poet of renown whom Poe admired. In the echoes of Tennyson's respect, Poe might have found the Germanic voice of Goethe, resonating through the years and the shadows of his own dark imaginings.",
            "In the land of sun and promise where the Pacific beats its endless dirge upon the shore, there lies a question of law and consequence. A woman, Jennifer Palmer by name, found herself lain low upon the hard tiles of a grocery store, felled not by fate but by the slick betrayal of applesauce. The law of California, with its statutes and codes, turns upon itself to ask if such a fall might yield more than the recompense for her pain. Might it, in its turning, render punitive damages upon the keeper of the store, one Paul Martin, who sat idly with his dinner as the spill lay unheeded?\n\nThe judge, a figure of solemn judgment, may hold his hand from dismissing Palmer's claim so easily. For the law demands that to seek punitive damages, one must show that the actions of the accused were not only careless but carried with them a willful and knowing disregard for the harm they would wreak. The conduct must be shown as despicable, a word heavy with moral weight. Palmer, with her counsel, will argue that Martin should have seen the harm coiled in that spill, for it was not the first of its kind. In the months before her fall, others had met the floor with equal violence, and yet Martin did nothing.\n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, 2009, the clock marked five in the afternoon when a young man named Rich Wayne, servant of D&D Markets, spoke to his superior, Paul Martin, of the applesauce's peril. Martin, breaking his bread, dismissed it as a minor annoyance. A quarter-hour passed and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan's, rose with the same warning. Martin's reply was unchanged. The clock moved on and at half-past five, Palmer fell.\n\nThe courts of California allow for punitive damages to be sought when a wrong is done with oppression, fraud, or malice. The law paints malice as an act intended to harm or, failing intent, an act so vile as to be done with a conscious disregard for the safety of others. In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., the court spoke of malice as a thing aware of its own danger yet choosing still to proceed. In the quiet halls of justice, these words will echo as Palmer seeks recompense for the injury borne of Martin's neglect.",
            "She had always felt a want like a hunger in her soul, a yearning that would not be sated. It had crept upon her at fourteen, the tender age when one begins to step into the shadowed paths of adolescent life. By seventeen it still lingered, unresolved and unrelenting. She had come to reckon it wasn't a thing she sought but a someone, yet no boy had ever stirred her heart. Suitors had approached, stumbling over themselves in the awkward dance of courtship, but none held her interest. She found herself pondering this enigma, wondering what peculiarity of spirit could cause such a deviation from the expected course of a young girl's life. She spun theories like a spider spins its web, but none held her fast. So she continued onward, ever questioning the nature of her desires.\n\nThe days at home were a gentle affair. Her parents were folk of quiet dispositions, their lives free of discord. Rarely did cross words pass between them, and scarcely ever with their daughter. Their disputes, if they could be called that, revolved around her fierce independence, the unyielding spirit that defined her. She was a child of calm souls, yet she brought a liveliness that countered their placid ways, endearing her to many with a charmed personality and a genuine kindness.\n\nYet today the tranquility was shattered. As she wandered the house in search of some spark to light her imagination, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. A sound that was her mother's voice. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the scene, her heart pounding with dread. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out, finding her mother sprawled upon the floor, her face twisted in pain, breathless whispers of \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out in desperate aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, squeezed out through the agony, and the daughter knew her mother suffered greatly. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and at that moment, the girl felt gratitude for the strength she had honed through practice. She gathered her mother in her arms, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back as if she were laying down the most precious of burdens.\n\nThe hospital loomed with its scent of antiseptic and the omnipresent air of dread. But the girl was unfazed by these things, her mind consumed with the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice calling out for the aid of the doctors. Faces tightened with concern surrounded them, and swiftly a rolling bed was brought forth, her mother gently placed upon it. They whisked her away to the sterile haven where ailments are met with care, and the daughter was left in the waiting room, alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a stepping stool, reaching high for a vase nestled in the uppermost cabinet of their home.",
            "In the quiet march of time, the study sought to unravel a truth about the Mediterranean way of eating, a diet of the ancients, transmuted into a modern form they called the aMed diet. It was a beacon in the heart of uncertainty, proposing that those who walked its path might find themselves less beset by the spectral hands of chronic heart disease and the stillness of stroke. This aMed diet, a shadow of its ancestral form, was a tapestry woven with the fruits of the earth, the proteins of plants save for the humble potato, and the bounties of the sea. It eschewed the heavy hand of saturated fats for the grace of monounsaturated oils and allowed the gentle touch of alcohol in moderation.\n\nIn the annals of prospective studies, there lay evidence of this diet's power, its inverse dance with the specter of mortality, both total and cardiovascular. Intervention too had shown the diet's might, surpassing the meager offerings of low-fat regimes in the battles of weight and the alchemy of cholesterol in the bulwarks of obesity. Yet the stroke, that sudden thief of vitality, had eluded these chronicles until now.\n\nThe study cast its net over the lives of 74,886 women, aged between 38 and 63 years, untouched by the ravages of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, members of that grand congregation known as the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from the year of our Lord 1984 to the year 2004, the learned authors drew forth the aMed diet scores from the women's own accounts of their sustenance, a ritual of self-report known as the food frequency questionnaire. Through two decades, the steadfast majority stayed true, their declarations subject to the scrutiny of validation studies. Reports of heart disease, of fatal heart disease, and stroke were sifted from the chaff of uncertainty by the hands of medical record, autopsy, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records lay absent, the cases were deemed probable, a shadow of certainty, yet included nonetheless.\n\nTo lessen the noise of random chance and better echo the truth of long-term dietary intake, the scholars calculated averages, drawing from the well of repeated measures over the years. Confounders, those tricksters that might mislead the unwary, were accounted for, adjusting for age, the smoke of tobacco, the weight of body mass, the tides of menopause and its hormonal travelers, the tablets of multivitamins, the indulgence of alcohol, the vigor of physical activity, and the salve of aspirin.\n\nThe statisticians employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a tool to peer into the relationship between the aMed score and the specters of heart disease and stroke, casting separate nets for the fatal and the nonfatal.\n\nIn the quiet tallying of two decades, they found that those who adhered more closely to the Mediterranean path, scoring higher on the aMed scale, had fewer encounters with the shadows of heart disease and stroke. In those years, 2391 new cases of heart disease arose, 1763 strokes were counted, and 1077 souls were claimed by the combined force of heart disease and stroke. Women in the upper echelons of the aMed score knew less of these shadows than their counterparts in the lower rungs, the relative risk standing at 0.71, a testament to the diet's quiet strength.",
            "The sign stands alone like a monolith on the street corner, a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page, the actress from that film Juno, her eyes reflecting something far off and distant. On the sign, a message scrawled in black Sharpie: Hitler is alive in Burma. Burma, or Myanmar as some call it now, a land under the iron grip of a military junta since the cold coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to a stirring, a gathering of voices that had lain dormant for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes, a color that would name their revolution, marched in defiance, their chants rising like smoke against the oppressive sky. The people watched, waited, and then joined, their patience waning as the junta's tolerance turned to violence. The monasteries, sacred and silent, became battlegrounds, the military storming in like wolves among sheep. Foreign eyes were not welcome, and those who dared to look, like the Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, paid with their lives. The official count stands at thirteen dead, but whispers from a defector, Colonel Hla Win, tell of thousands, their bodies hidden from the world's view.\n\nThis is the world we know, where power seeks to silence the whispers of dissent with the iron fist of history. The Romans, emperors by divine right, ruled with a will as hard as the stones of their roads. In Japan, the emperors claimed divinity, leading their people through the ages of swords and technology. Across the ocean, the president named George, his counsel with preachers of ignorance, a strange echo of those who came before.\n\nThe tales of tyranny are many, like shadows cast long by the setting sun. In 1989, in the vastness of Tiananmen, they gathered, those who dared to dream of freedom. The numbers of the dead are lost in the fog of war, the truth a casualty as much as the bodies. Rwanda, a land torn by hatred, saw the Hutu rise against the Tutsi, the blood of innocents spilled in a government-sanctioned madness. And then there was Hitler, the architect of an era of darkness, his Reich spreading like a plague until the world itself burned.\n\nThese are the stories of our time and times past, the cycles of power and blood that turn like the seasons, unyielding and eternal.",
            "The long shadow of Duke Ellington stretches across the vast expanse of jazz, a testament to his enduring presence and the artful hand he wielded in shaping his orchestra. His touch upon the piano is as a whisper in the night, subtle and pervasive, but as a composer, he spun tapestries of sound rich and intricate, each thread woven with the skill of a master craftsman. Ellington built a stage upon which soloists might dance, unfettered and free, yet also wrote with the precision of a watchmaker, crafting phrases that called forth the unique timbre of each player, drawing out the heart of the orchestra itself. It was in this alchemy of sound that he forged something new, sounds that stood apart, that sang with their own voice.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s innovation, naming Creole Love Call as a testament to his use of the voice as an instrument of jazz, a voice that paints with broad strokes, unhindered by the fetters of words. This piece is a tapestry, six choruses in all, each a departure and a return:\n\nChorus one, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins smooth as silk, only to grow ragged and raw. The second chorus is a muted trumpet, twisting the melody like a river bends, blue notes stretching out like shadows at sundown. A clarinet then takes the stage, soaring high as a bird on the wind, the piano beneath it an undercurrent of syncopation. The fourth chorus brings the band in full, echoing the call and response, brass and reeds entwined in a dance. The fifth chorus climbs to its peak, the reeds now leading, high and wild, as the brass and rhythm hold the time. The sixth, a return to the beginning, the voice now growling, a beast of an instrument. A brief tag, a vocal run, the trombone a discordant end.\n\nEllington’s use of the voice as a brush to paint tone upon the canvas of his work is but one stroke in his legacy. In Hot and Bothered, recorded but a year later, Ellington’s hand is as precise as ever, orchestrating with an ear for the colors of sound. A dialogue between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, the vocal strains of the trumpet and the instrumental notes in Cox’s voice weave together, rich and full. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further still, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, a staple of Ellington’s orchestra, his sound a cornerstone upon which the music is built.",
            "In the vast theater of the natural world, creatures evolve as if guided by the hands of some unseen clockmaker, their changes both mysterious and inevitable. The constraints of this evolution, the unseen walls that shape their path, remain as elusive as the shadows at dusk. D’Arcy Thompson, in the year of our Lord 1917, mused that the language of mathematics had scarcely touched the simplest of organic forms, and the echo of his words lingers even now. Yet in recent times, the lens of mathematical modeling peers into the very essence of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage of these creatures through the ages as Raup and Stanley once did in the year 1981. Our inquiry delves into the realm of Prunum, where mathematical modeling entwines with experimentation to uncover the secrets of evolutionary change, both in direction and magnitude.\n\nWe turn to the x-ray's cold gaze upon the Prunum species, where the language of numbers delineates the parameters of skeletal form, feeding them into the maw of a program named CerioShell, born of Stone’s mind in 1995. From this crucible emerge visions of shells both imagined and real, their morphologies whispering of the boundaries that bind Prunum’s evolutionary dance. These findings, in concert with the hands-on touch of experiment and the art of description, seek to unravel the tapestry of macroevolution within this lineage.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and transformation, is a tube that winds its way through the ages, twisting upon itself in its eternal spiral. These revolutions, these whorls, encircle an imaginary axis, a pillar known as the columella. The whorls grow at varying paces, divided by the suture, a seam that marks their passage. The final and largest whorl, the body whorl, stands apart from the spire, composed of the whorls that precede it. At the spire’s tip lies the apex, and at its opposite end, the base. The creature within extends through the aperture, the gateway of its shell.\n\nGaze upon these shells from every angle: the apical, the basal, the apertural, and the abapertural. In the usual view, the aperture faces the observer, the apex reaching skyward. To count the whorls, one must peer from the apex, discern the first suture’s beginning, and draw a line that cleaves the shell. From this line, the whorls are counted, estimated to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nEach shell is a chronicle, a story of apertures traveling through the corridors of time and space, as the creature builds its home. This journey can be traced, mapped with coordinates marking each whorl’s aperture, its radii both horizontal and vertical.\n\nSuch a path can be rendered in the language of graphs and equations. And once this mathematical tapestry is woven, it becomes possible to alter the course of the mollusk’s skeletogenesis, changing the very nature of its creation.",
            "In that sprawling archipelago where the sun rises over endless seas, the rate at which the very breath of newborns is stilled has hung constant, a grim measure unyielding across a decade's passage. While Indonesia strides toward the distant light of the Millennium's promises, the path for mothers and their babes remains shrouded, the goals unmet and the hands of the clock relentless. Beneath the surface, the reasons for this faltering become clear—an ailing system calls for healing, not mere patches upon its wounds.\n\nAnd yet, there are signs of life, for the cries of birth now more often echo with the presence of skilled hands. Seventy-two of every hundred births now find such guidance, though it is a guidance of tradition. Old ways persist in the guise of midwives, unable to stem the tide when blood flows too freely, leaving a trail of mothers claimed by hemorrhage. It is a promise half-kept, a statistic that whispers of progress yet hides the truth of the road still to tread. Meanwhile, the young suffer in silence, fewer now seeking the healer’s touch for the scourge of diarrheal affliction, and in postnatal care, the story is yet unwritten, incomplete and troubling in its scarcity.\n\nIn the cities, beneath the concrete and steel, the knife of the surgeon finds its place, though in the rural lands, it remains a stranger. Four in a hundred births see the cesarean's deliverance, a number that betrays the inequity between the bustling urban and the quiet rural. The chasm between the rich and the poor yawns wide, a testament to the burden of coins that weigh heavy in the hands of the destitute, blocking their path to healing.\n\nAs the nation ponders the road ahead, a question looms like a specter—how to mend that which is broken? Should the focus be on the specific, the immediate, or should it lay upon the broader canvas of the health system entire? The allure of the targeted, the swift, is undeniable. To seize upon a single thread and pull, to watch it unravel with purpose, is a tempting thought. But beware the cost, for to pour all into one vessel is to leave others dry, and the weavers of health will flock to where the gold is bright. The tale of one illness finds its echo in the neglect of another, a dance of resources uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers that stifle the very breath of progress.",
            "In the expanse of a century, the catalog of Popular Music has swelled to encompass so many divergent strains and offshoots that one might find it a futile endeavor to name them all. And therein lies the tangle, for each genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to scribble but a few—has given rise to its own broods of sub-genres, and those to sub-sub-genres, a lineage unbroken and unending. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, stands as a testament to this evolution, having burgeoned into one of the most variegated and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in the spectrum of emotions it conjures, though the shadows often find their home therein. Its diversity is a testament to its malleability, a trait recognized early by those who wielded it, who bent it to their own designs, and so begat a multitude of sub-genres, a cycle that endures to this day.\n\nWe find ourselves now amid a labyrinth of heavy metal, where the myriad niches defy simple classification. It has absorbed the essence of other genres, yet like all things, it has its origins. To truly grasp the metal that permeates today's airwaves, one must first delve into the metal movement itself, for it is a movement, a force, rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal is, in essence, a movement clad in darkness. It is a music of excess—excess in bass, in volume, in ferocity, in spectacle. It casts aside the primitive for the complex; the musicians within its fold wield their instruments with a mastery that echoes through their creations. And as it may come as no revelation, metal is a movement that walks hand in hand with the specter of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove its adherents to the brink, birthing records that traversed the realms of the strange and the surreal, each note an echo of the substances that inspired them. It embraced the dark, the visceral, a novelty in a world where much of popular music shied from such shadows. The later progeny of metal drew from this well, finding kinship with the Romantic Era's own dalliance with darkness, visceral and unyielding. The lyrics, etched in darkness, are the heart of this movement.\n\nThese words from Helter Skelter reveal the Beatles' shadowed side. They chart the crests and troughs, ostensibly a nod to the influence of drugs. Some hold this song as the harbinger of Heavy Metal, born of a challenge, a riposte to a Rolling Stones tune that tread on the heavier, unlit paths. The Beatles, not to be outdone, inscribed it onto The White Album, a testament to their own capacity for heaviness.",
            "In the years before the surrealists cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who fashioned dreams from the very fabric of his soul. His painting, The Dream, born in 1910, stands not merely as an image of a woman awash in the mysteries of a dreamt jungle but as a testament to Rousseau’s own aspirations, both spoken and unspoken, as an artist. He longed for the nod of approval, the embrace of his peers, and the applause of those who knew art's language. Yet, he stood at a crossroad, a silent war within him, torn between two paths: to tread the well-worn road of conformity, painting in a manner that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of acceptance, or to carve his own passage, to be a beacon of singularity in a world of echoes.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first walk through the corridors of Rousseau’s life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, the son of a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who thrived in the modest comfort of bourgeois life, young Henri knew not the teachings of art’s masters. Instead, he toiled in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a collector of tolls, though the world remembers him as a douanier, a customs man. His life bore the scars of grief, the passing of Clémence, his first wife, and the loss of eight children, leaving him with Julia, his daughter, and sorrow so deep it sought the solace of a brush and canvas. Unlike those who romanticized the peasant’s plight, Rousseau painted not with sentimentality but with the earnest dreams of a man of his time and place.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is a tale of context and circumstance. Untrained in the refined techniques, he began his journey at an age when others had already made their mark. In the shadow of giants, he labored, seeking his place as Matisse and the like carved their own legends. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of this dichotomy, the contrast between Rousseau and Matisse, each driven by different demons. Matisse, wary of the banal, sought to break free from it, while Rousseau, with every stroke, hoped to weave a tapestry so conventional that it might unlock the gates of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet spaces between the lines of the world, there lies an understanding that needs no words. Many a mind has sought to draw the lines between the good and the beautiful, to find where truth and beauty meet. There is something deep and unspoken that ties these together, as if whispered by the earth itself. Keats, in his eternal reflection upon a Grecian urn, spoke of beauty and truth as one and the same. And so, it seems that the heart knows the good and the beautiful without the need for lessons or learning. These are not taught in the schools of man but come as whispers from the world itself. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, they do not command but rather reveal. They do not dictate the path but show the way the light falls upon it. We study them not to lay down laws but to understand the heart of what makes a thing right or a piece of art worthy. In our critiques, we wander through fields of thought, unable to capture fully the essence of what we chase, for some things are beyond the reach of words. The Mona Lisa's smile, it holds secrets that elude the grasp of explanation, as if to say, there's just something about it. \n\nWords fall short, as O'Connor knew, for what is in the heart of a story cannot be captured by mere statement. We speak of art, of morals, and yet there is always something left unsaid, a shadow that dances just beyond the edge of the firelight. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond expression, and in that, we find a truth that connects the beauty we see to the good we feel, a bond that is woven into the fabric of our being.\n\nIn the realm where soul touches soul, art and morality stand together, both felt more deeply than they can be explained. They speak to us in a language of the heart, in the quiet voice of what is beyond the veil. Literature, more than any other, carries within it the pulse of morality, the whisper of values that echo through life itself. It is here, in the pages that turn with the wind of time, where we find the weight of what is right, the light of what is beautiful. And so it is, the stories we tell, they are the bridges between what is and what ought to be, between the seen and the unseen, between the good and the beautiful.",
            "In the land of Germany as we now see it, there lies a strength borne from unity, a tapestry of culture that stretches from the shadowed alps of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This same spirit courses through the veins of Köln along the Rhine and threads its way to the Saxon heart of Dresden on the Elbe. A culture so singular yet woven from threads of varied tribes and distant echoes, it stands as a testament to the many sources from which Germany has sprung.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, holds within its name a mystery that has long beguiled the minds of scholars and historians alike. Tacitus spun a tale of the Tungrians, a tribe of ancient repute, claiming they bore the name Germans before they dared the crossing of the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of conquest, spoke of the Germans, borrowing a name from the very foes he sought to subdue, a name that marked the divide between the known and the unconquered. The Gauls had their word, Germanus, to set apart those not yet brought to heel. Some wise in etymology suggest the name arose from a neighbor’s tongue, a word of demarcation or perhaps from the spear, the ger, wielded with fearsome might, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout to pierce the air, a testament to their clamor in battle.\n\nTacitus, in the year of our Lord ninety-eight, penned his thoughts on the origins of these people in De Origine et situ Germanorum. He saw them as a race untouched by the migrations and minglings of others, rooted, steadfast. “For who among the travelers would leave the sunlit lands of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germany, with its unkind skies and somber ways, unless it were his homeland?”\n\nAnd what Roman would forsake the opulence of Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their legions to the edges of Germania, seeking riches and skirmishes, yet their hearts longed for the marble halls of their empire. The Germanic tribes, appearing as shadows at the empire's border, traded in goods borne of the earth and lent their swords to Roman legions, biding their time as history unfolded its relentless march.",
            "In the dimming light of Illyria, where the shadows of men and women entwine in the dance of deception, the play Twelfth Night casts a somber truth. Disguise, a tool of cunning, serves its master well in orchestrating the symphony of deceit, yet in its final act demands a reckoning. A soul, clad in borrowed garb too long, risks dissolution in the masquerade, a ghost adrift between reality and illusion. To tear away the veil is to stand exposed, alienated from those who once walked beside you. Thus, the heart must choose its tether—self-preservation or the fragile bonds of kinship. For some, the unmasking is met with silent acceptance, yet others take affront, scorning the artifice with wounded pride.\n\nIn the realm of gender, this deception weaves a more complex tapestry, unraveling questions of identity and the impetus to forsake one's true visage. Viola, cast upon these shores, dons the guise of a man—a shield against the world's predations. “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” she confides, her voice a whisper in the gathering dusk. But in this guise, she finds herself severed from the sisterhood, a stranger among her own. Olivia, beguiled by the semblance of a man, mistakes her heart's desire, entwining her fate with the mistaken identity of Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,” she pleads, lost in the labyrinth of love and misconception. And there lies Orsino, whose words to the boy echo with unspoken longing: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nIn the eyes of the modern, this play unfolds as a map of hidden desires, its characters ensnared by the deceptions that lay bare their heart's true yearnings. Olivia's attraction to Cesario begs the question—does the guise of masculinity alone hold her affections, or does her heart, unbidden, lean toward the feminine? Yet, Shakespeare’s hand seems not to craft a woman of such disposition, but rather to mirror the folly of an age that weighed worth by the sheen of outward appearance. Her swift shift of affection to Sebastian, and the embracing of Viola as kin, speaks to a capricious heart swayed more by visage than by essence: “A sister, you are she.” The play, then, is a mirror held to the human soul, reflecting both the folly and the truth that dwell within.",
            "The German colonial endeavor, in its breadth and reach, wore the visage of a harsh and unforgiving master, its infamy sealed in the annals of history through the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was once German South West Africa. Yet to cast such a sprawling enterprise under one shadow is to overlook its disparate nature. Like the lands it claimed, the empire was a patchwork of varied policies and governance. In education, too, it was a mosaic, with each colony telling its own story. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, or Tanganyika as it was known in the year of our Lord 1919, they uncovered a realm where the tongues of the people were not foreign to learning. The Germans had left their mark, a legacy of literacy that did not go unnoticed, even in places like Kamerun where their efforts drew nods of approval from those who came after.\n\nBut in the sun-baked expanse of South West Africa, now Namibia, the tale took a different turn. Here, unlike the schools that rose in East Africa, education of the native sons and daughters was a duty laid upon the mission houses, starved of any substantial succor from the state. The government, though, did not shirk when it came to the European settlers, investing heavily in their instruction, laying down state schools and fortifying the mission schools with funds and regulations of their own devising. These choices, these paths chosen, cast long shadows across the land, shadows that lingered long after the Germans themselves had passed from sovereignty. Where elsewhere in the empire the children grew to read and write, here in South West Africa, they remained largely untouched by the light of literacy, left in the dark by a confluence of forces both seen and unseen.\n\nThis discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to delve into the motives and attitudes that shaped this divergence, drawing upon the labors of those who have documented the German educational odyssey. Much of this lore lies buried in the tongue of the Germans, penned in the days when the empire itself was a living breath. These early tomes served as chronicles of the educational landscape, while later works in the English tongue sought to compare and contrast the schooling of one colony to another, teasing out the strands that wove their distinct tapestries. Foremost among these is Cohen’s treatise on the educational paths of South West Africa and East Africa, a study that lays bare the contrasts and seeks the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers, a throng of them in South West Africa, as a key to understanding why its schools were as they were.\n\nIn the eyes of the Germans, South West Africa was a land tempered by climate, more forgiving than others, though much of it lay under the dominion of the relentless desert. By the year 1913, nearly fifteen thousand souls of European descent called it home, far outnumbering those in East Africa, the next haven for settlers, where their numbers did not exceed 5,336. Here in this land, they sought to carve out a new life, and in doing so, shaped the fate of the land’s education in their image.",
            "In the annals of time, the United States of America and Mexico stand as testament to two lands once locked in a rivalry that stretched over the better part of six decades, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the closing years of the century in 1893. The zenith of this discord found its cruel expression in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with fire and iron, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the vast expanses of the American Southwest. This was not the only clash. No, many skirmishes marked the years between them, their fervor only beginning to wane as the world edged toward the abyss of the First World War. The seeds of this enmity were sown in the fertile ground of conflicting beliefs and traditions, the very marrow of their peoples, and the material desires that often set men at odds with one another.\n\nIt is not a tale untold by history, this notion of neighbors bound by geography yet divided by their ambitions. Borders, drawn by the hand of man, often serve as lines of conflict as much as they do lines of demarcation. And so it was with the United States and Mexico, mirroring rivalries seen elsewhere in the world. David M. Pletcher, in his reflections, spoke of the enduring nature of American diplomatic quandaries, finding them most acutely in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These lands, while close in miles, have oft been distant in harmony, their relations with the United States a stark contrast to the relative peace found further down the Latin American expanse.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, drove a wedge between these nations. Sally Frahm observed how the Americans, in the twilight of the eighteenth and the dawn of the nineteenth centuries, stood opposed to the specters of Catholicism and monarchy, much as they later would to fascism and communism. The ideological battleground was not one of governance but of belief, a heritage of distrust passed down from English and Spanish forebears, a legacy that shadowed the possibilities of friendship across the border.\n\nThe scholars Diehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes that punctuated the era of rivalry, more than mere footnotes in history's ledger. The bulk of these were struggles over land and borders, where raiders and bandits moved like whispers in the night across the vast deserts and plains, until the firm hand of military might from both nations brought some semblance of order to the chaos. As time drew on, Schmitt tells us, Mexico found itself in a position of reliance upon its northern neighbor, and the embers of territorial ambition cooled, giving way to the new fires of economic entanglement as the century waned.",
            "It was some fifteen years past when the world shifted beneath my feet, a sudden lurch into darkness by way of an illness I had never heard a whisper of. I was a nurse back then. The path I chose, not for love of it, but for the promise of surety and sanctuary denied to me in the rough years of youth. A mantra, it was, echoing through the halls of my coming of age—work you’ll find, for folk will always ail and need tending. So, though dreams tugged at the corners of my heart to be a scientist, a journalist, perhaps both, I set my course in nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood, forty-six years gone, solitary, with a bank barren as the desert and hands bound from the work that had defined me. Disabled, they called it, and on fifteen years of the dole from Social Security, I found myself stripped bare of all that could be claimed as mine. I scrape by, yet each day is a skirmish, a siege upon my dwindling sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty became a ghost, but one truth remained steadfast: without kin and the few souls who call themselves friends, I would not have weathered the long years. Strength, they say, is what you need when calamity strikes, but strength is a fickle companion in the storm.\n\nEmergencies, they come as they will—great and small, like the tide. No guarantee in this life, and for all the preparedness one might muster, some things rise too vast to be bested alone.\n\nIn the land of the free, we must cease placing our trust in the rotted basket of government. The decay is plain to see. Yet I yearn for a time when Americans might once more place faith in one another—learn anew the arts of giving and receiving aid rather than each scurrying to fashion bunkers in the yard.\n\nThose who raise the banner of rugged individualism speak of the past's glories. But truth be told, it was not the solitary grit that saw our forebears through the trials. It was the kindness, the respect shared among them, and the pooling of what was had. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in their trains of wagons reached the far coast not by solitude but by the strength of the many.\n\nSo, ready yourself, by all means. I have done the same. A kit of disasters with supplies for first aid, tablets to cleanse water, and sheets of plastic with tape for sealing against horrors unseen. I own flashlights aplenty, batteries in abundance, candles that will burn, and matches that will strike even in the rain, with canned goods to stave off hunger. Should you possess land and means to farm, to preserve, do so. A wood stove is a comfort, provided you're not hemmed in an apartment block.\n\nBut as you prepare, seek out your neighbors.",
            "In a time long shrouded in the fog of centuries past, there came into this world a prince whose destiny would shape the tides of human thought. Born into the opulence of a royal life, he would turn his back on it all to wander the ascetic path and find enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree. Known to the world as the Buddha, his teachings would lay the foundation for a faith that would span the ages, known in its most orthodox form as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient creed, now standing on the cusp of two and a half millennia, wears a visage altered by the passage of time. In lands like Sri Lanka, loyal to the Theravada tradition, rituals unfold that the Buddha himself never envisioned. The water-cutting ceremony, an annual rite, draws both the devout and the restless, infusing it with a sanctity unspoken in the earliest teachings. The faith, in its journey through time, has seen its skin and soul reshaped by forces both within and without, benevolent and antagonistic.\n\nWe must speak of forces that shape and reshape. Internal forces arise from within, born of the followers of the Buddhasasana, be they clad in the saffron robes of the monk or the simple garb of the layman. External forces, those that loom from outside the faith, come from the hands and minds of non-believers. Hostile forces seek to rend and ravage, born of spite or misunderstanding. Yet there are also benign forces, indifferent as a passing wind, which may sway the course with neither malice nor aid intended. Such terms will become familiar as this tale unfolds.\n\nTo begin with the essence, we must delve into the heart of what is believed. Buddhists find their sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma speaks through the ancient Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the very bones of metaphysical thought. Concepts like Anatta, the absence of a soul, Dukkha, the suffering woven into existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all, form the very breath of this doctrine. Only by grasping these truths can one break the relentless wheel of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. In its wake, desires, hatred, and delusions—all shall be extinguished in the light of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the rules for life: five precepts for the common folk and a myriad more for the monastics. At the core lie the four noble truths—life is suffering, attachment breeds suffering, and suffering can be vanquished. Such is the path laid bare for those who seek."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vastness of the world, culture stands as an unseen hand shaping the course of human discourse. It is a thing as elusive as the shadows cast by the waning sun, defined as much by absence as by presence, a mosaic of what it is and what it is not. A singular entity it is not, nor does it adhere to uniformity. The utterance that all Russians possess a stubborn resolve or that all Japanese yield with grace is a simplification too broad to hold weight. To know the broad strokes of a culture is but a beginning; the true task lies in discerning the depths of its influence upon the parley, understanding how its ethos will steer the dialogue at the table. The foreign culture is approached not in isolation but through the lens of one’s own, where comparisons burgeon unbidden.\n\nTo fathom the heart of another culture or the mind that it births requires a journey through its history, an acknowledgment of its biases. Not to judge nor to alter, but to accept it as it stands, to navigate within its confines, especially when one’s own standing is frail. On foreign soil, respect for the customs and credos of the land can bridge the chasm of cultural divides, propelling the negotiation onward.\n\nCulture is not bound by the borders of nations alone. Within each land, companies forge their own ethos. A corporate culture might demand the candle burn at both ends or may instead embrace a gentler rhythm. It reveals itself in the fabric of attire, in words spoken plain or wrapped in nuance, in the delegation of tasks. Where some companies nurture the spirit of giving in all its forms, others channel it through narrow avenues. The tapestry of American corporate culture alone, woven with threads of diversity from city to suburb, speaks to the multitude of thought within a single society. In lands where culture appears more monolithic, the surface is but a veil to be lifted.\n\nValues, those silent sentinels, hold the key to understanding the why of a culture. Where face and harmony are prized, a negotiator will not cast shame upon his kin to claim victory. Conversely, one from a land that esteems the fierce bargain will not hasten to settle. Such truths must be grasped before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, wisdom lies in the knowing of one’s adversary not just by creed but by character, for it is this knowledge that renders negotiation true.",
            "In the quietude of the soul, the fool whispers to himself a denial of the divine, and so it is written in Psalm 14. This ancient utterance finds its echo in the words of St. Anselm, who in his musings on the Almighty lays bare a path of faith-bound understanding. Alongside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, each of them defenders of the same celestial truth. Our task is to weigh their words, to discern which among them speaks with greater clarity. To this end, we must first acknowledge their shared conviction in the existence of the Biblical God, for to entertain any other deity would render their arguments as ships adrift without an anchor.\n\nLet us look upon Anselm, who beckons us inward to find that God dwells not in distant heavens but within the confines of our own reckoning. In his view, the mind itself bears witness to a divine presence that defies the very notion of nonexistence. Though his prose may wander through thickets of complexity, the heart of his claim is that within the human soul lies the testament of God's existence, needing no external corroboration. It is a faith unadorned by empirical trappings, a quiet assurance that resounds within the chambers of belief.\n\nTurn now to Aquinas, whose gaze extends beyond the self to the world that surrounds. His is a philosophy built upon reason's bedrock, where God's presence is woven into the very fabric of reality. Through five pillars of logic—change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony—he constructs a scaffold upon which the divine rests. Each argument is a strand in the tapestry of necessity, a declaration that the absence of God leaves the puzzle of existence incomplete. It is a doctrine that seeks to convert through the power of intellect, offering a vision of belief that stands unshaken by doubt.\n\nIn the end, both men offer their truths, each a mirror reflecting the divine in its own light. Yet, neither can wholly encompass the vastness of faith, for the divine is a mystery that eludes even the most earnest of seekers.",
            "In the telling of tales, writers weave their incantations, crafting the world that pulses with life or death upon the page. There are those who wield language like a painter his brush, casting hues of feeling and thought across the canvas of the mind. F. Scott Fitzgerald is such an artist, and in his opus, The Great Gatsby, he conjures images that linger like the scent of rain on a parched earth. He pairs words that seem at odds, yet in their union they call forth an aura that settles upon the reader like dust on a forgotten mantelpiece. With symbols, he does the same, breathing life into them until they thrum with meaning.\n\nFitzgerald paints with colors—gold, green, white and gray, red and pink—each stroke deliberate, each hue a whisper of what lies beneath. In The Great Gatsby, these colors are given weight, white and gray especially, imbued with a sense of sameness, a whisper of what has been and what may never be again. White stands a bit apart, a reflection of the higher echelons, while gray speaks of age and the slow fade into obscurity. From the novel’s onset, these shades pervade, cloaking characters in a veneer of societal expectation. Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white, drift through the pages like specters of privilege. Nick attends Gatsby's gathering in white flannels, Tom in a white shirt, and Catherine powdered milky white as if to suggest a purity that life has long since sullied.\n\nYet, when the world shifts to Gatsby’s revelries, color breaks the monotony, vibrant and unrestrained. The commonplace becomes white and gray, as Nick traverses the white chasms of New York, as the names of the partygoers fade to gray upon his list. Catherine's abode, a slice of white among the uniformity, a testament to the sameness of existence. Common folk and forgotten places are cast in these shades—Jordan and Daisy in their white girlhood, the gray cars, the gray land, the Italian child and the gray old man, all swallowed by the valley of ashes.\n\nAnd with this weight of meaning, Fitzgerald turns to Daisy once more. She emerges from the narrative clothed in white, a spectral presence in a white roadster, less a woman and more a mirage of what Gatsby covets. She drifts through the haze of gray fur, once more donned in white as the storm brews between Tom and Gatsby, a symbol of the unattainable, the uniform, the dream that never was.",
            "In the lands of San Diego County, where the sun holds dominion over the sky and the earth yields its bounty with quiet grace, there lies a realm of agriculture both vast and varied. The soil, warmed by the gentle hand of a mild climate, brings forth a harvest of tomatoes and citrus, of leafy greens that sway in the breeze like ocean kelp, of squash and broccoli, herbs that speak of ancient remedies, and tree fruits as sweet as they are scarce. Peaches hang heavy on the boughs alongside lemons, berries grow in wild profusion, and peppers lend their fire to the fields. Here, in this fertile expanse, the notion of organic community-supported agriculture takes root, burgeoning in popularity with such fervor that the waiting lists of local growers stretch long and winding like the roads that cross these lands. The call for organic eggs and milk echoes across the valleys, answered by farms that open their gates to those who seek more than sustenance—a glimpse into the workings of the earth, a walk among the rows where birds sing and the land breathes.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming is not without its trials, for it demands a labor as relentless as the sun's passage across the sky. The hands that tend these fields must do so with care, forgoing the ease of chemicals to nurture the soil, to guard against pests and weeds with the vigilance of a watchman in the night. Yet in these efforts lies a reward beyond profit—a biodiversity that flourishes in the absence of man's poisons, a harmony of plant and creature that thrives on the land's own terms. The small farmer, lacking the vast machinery of large-scale operations, must turn to wisdom and will to balance the ledger of nature and commerce. And so they may seek the counsel of those who have walked this path before, those who know the ways of cover crops and grazing rotation, who understand that to manage a landscape is to sculpt a living tapestry of life.\n\nIn this story of land and labor, we find a parcel near the town of Potrero, nestled against the Cleveland National Forest in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. One hundred and sixty acres of chaparral and nonnative grassland, where oak woodlands stand sentinel, where the East County Southern Foothills stretch under the aegis of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The voices of a hundred species echo here, some on the brink of silence—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that flutter on the edge of memory, the California gnatcatcher singing a song of survival. The land remembers its past, the tread of Native Americans who knew its secrets, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who came in the late 1800s, staking claims and leaving their mark.\n\nIn the quest to understand what might be achieved upon this land, I sought the wisdom of a real estate listing, the promise of government programs that whisper of assistance to those who would take up the mantle of small-scale farming. And as a beacon of possibility, I found an organic farm in this very region—a testament to the resilience of those who work the land, who strive to make a life that is both bountiful and kind to the world they inhabit.",
            "There exists a bond between brothers, a tether unyielding and eternal. Within its confines stir emotions as old as Cain and Abel, love and pride intermingled with jealousy and cruelty, a volatile brew. Brothers see each other with a clarity denied to others, a reflection of themselves cast in the eyes of their kin. It is in moments of desperation that this bond reveals its true nature, be it for salvation or destruction, and the cost of such revelations is steep. To comprehend the emotions born of this brotherhood is to reckon with the consequences they summon. When a brother gazes into the eyes of another and sees there his own likeness, he beholds not the visage presented to the world but his own unvarnished truth. In the deeds done and the repercussions thereof lies the essence of their character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" such a bond is tested, the tempest of emotions that accompany it laid bare. Against a backdrop of vibrant, pulsating life, the two brothers embark on a journey doomed to futility. Pride and disappointment wage war in a scene that leaves only one brother standing. Through the stark depiction of Doodle, the protagonist, and the charged exchanges between them, as well as the narrator’s lens, the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his perception of his world are revealed, shaping his every act.\n\nPride is the lodestar of the protagonist's actions. From the first ventures with his fragile brother Doodle to their final, fateful outing, resentment simmers within him. He longed for a brother he could mold, to teach the arts of breath-holding, running, and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a perch-mate in the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams, wild and unchecked, were dashed by Doodle's frailty, his heart so weak it was a wonder he lived at all, let alone could partake in such exertions. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, his fantasies shattered like brittle glass. Even so, anger festers, the thought of smothering the child a dark shadow in his mind. Yet a mere smile from the little one melts his resolve, a simple gesture that reignites hope. It reveals a love for his brother that, though buried, was always there, an instinctual bond that defied even his darkest musings.",
            "The human brain stands as a labyrinthine testament to the mysteries of the cosmos, a vessel of infinite creativity and ceaseless computation. In the march of time, as humankind trudged forth from the shadows of its primitive dawn to the glaring brightness of modernity, so too did the symbols we forged to grasp the ineffable nature of our own minds evolve. Once likened to a waxen slate, then to the delicate parchment of a papyrus scroll, and further still to the silent pages of a book, our most recent metaphor casts the brain in the cold, mechanical light of a computer. Yet, as you wade through the murky waters of neural knowledge, be wary of these metaphors, for they are but crude instruments and may lead you astray.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the whisper of the world upon our flesh, the touch of heat, the song of sound waves, the silent cascade of light's photons, all transmuted into the electrochemical symphony within our skulls. The sensory tale unfurls, crafted by the brain's alchemy through the dual pathways of creation: the bottom-up and the top-down. When your eyes fall upon the stark image of a black box adrift on a white sea, the bottom-up journey stitches together the threads of color and form, the abrupt borders where the dark meets the light, declaring the presence of a box. Meanwhile, the top-down current rides upon the bottom-up decisions, hastening recognition until the box stands revealed, not as some void but as the solid black presence it truly is.\n\nJust as the story is told, so too must it be weighed. An unseen hand within the mind sifts through the sensory harvest, discerning the vital from the trivial, deciding what shall pass through the gates of cognition. Though the blades of grass beneath your feet escape your notice, each one processed yet none remembered, the whisper of your name in a cacophonous room rises above the din. Thus, the mind's journey is one of stages, where attention is the tide that shapes the land.\n\nTo unravel the tale, the brain must first engrave its runes upon the tablets of memory. Memory is manifold, from the fleeting traces of the sensory to the ephemeral grasp of the working, and the deep wells of the long-term. The act of encoding is the first rite, each sense its own language—a word seen, a word heard, a word understood. Once inscribed, the memory must endure. In some creatures, the memory of the moment lingers in a loop of electricity through the neurons, a brief echo held for mere seconds. The long tales of the past, it is said, reside in the very architecture of proteins, their structures the silent keepers of our history.\n\nThe maps of knowledge are drawn in many ways, some sketched from the whims of human recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the silent whispers of the neurons themselves. The semantic network model speaks of nodes, each a concept, bound by threads of meaning—\"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" a web unending. In this maze of thought, the mind wanders, forever seeking, forever finding.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States found itself ensnared in the grip of a financial cataclysm most dire. The specter of unemployment rose like a dark tide, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the towering giants of American enterprise lay broken and scattered across the economic wasteland. This relentless recession holds its sway even now, and so we are compelled to ask: by what means did this calamity come to pass, and what salve might yet mend it? In essence, this crisis was borne of reckless and shortsighted machinations within the political sphere, a folly that goaded banks and businesses alike into the reckless issuance of sub-prime loans, thrust upon a fragile and unripe financial edifice. Meanwhile, those behemoths of mortgage, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were coerced to underwrite and repackage these ill-fated loans into CDOs and CDSs. When the debtors defaulted, the banks found themselves bereft of the capital reserves needed to stem the tide, and the chaos was thus visited upon the repackaged mortgages they had sold, seeping inexorably into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster trace back to 1999, within the tenure of President Clinton, who sought to extend his grasp upon the office by currying favor with the populace. To this end, his administration loosened the strictures of lending, planting the seeds of ruin that would bloom into the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes, with a prescient eye, foresaw the storm on the horizon: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As has been laid bare, and as Holmes did portend, such reckless lending practices were destined to unravel the economic tapestry.\n\nA confluence of forces conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, not least of which was the convoluted architecture of mortgages themselves. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding ever more sectors of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This interlocking of fortunes led households across the nation, and financial markets alike, to overextend their reach, leaving them exposed like raw nerves to the slightest tremor in price.\n\nThe housing bubble did indeed burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes upon these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great titans of investment banking in the U.S. together found themselves burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was rent asunder, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the chains of commercial banks, subject to the stern hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were consigned to the aegis of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vast and barren land where the would-be scribe unfurls their wings and takes to the heavens, dazzling those below with prose that enchants as much as it ensnares. Or perhaps it is the barren field where the reader's eyes grow heavy and their fingers itch to turn back, muttering curses beneath their breath. Dr. Merlin oft finds herself railing at the glowing screen, caught in the snare of an excess of words that fail to delight, neither in the mundane nor the grand.\n\nExposition, that siren, is no friend to the storyteller.\n\nThe wise among you know well the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still Dr. Merlin finds herself lost in the weeds of text where naught occurs, or perhaps too much. Exposition is the devil perched upon your shoulder, whispering that the past must be laid bare before the tale can truly begin, a different voice than the one urging the laying bare of all trivial details from the characters' youthful days.\n\nExposition serves to lay down what has transpired, often in plain speech. In cinema, it comes to pass when one soul unburdens a torrent of knowledge upon another, as in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the world of fiction, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nAn illustration may serve. As you traverse through a tale, you learn that the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain hour, that they wed in grand celebration, and that he was taken from her in sudden violence. You would not foresee this unfolding in the span of two pages, with both uttering but a pair of lines apiece. You would hope the author lingers upon the husband, revealing his affections through speech and bearing, and likewise that the heroine's devotion is laid bare through acts both large and small, showing how his presence wove richness into her life. Such a telling would draw you into the husband’s fate and open a window into the heroine's soul, revealing what she saw in him, the depth of their union, casting light upon her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes. You would share in her mourning, and in doing so, find yourself bound more tightly to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you seek substance upon the skeletal frame of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the architect of this tale, it falls to you to add this substance. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet continues undeterred*) The urge may arise to hasten past the mundane. You may sketch a new character, noting he once flew with the Air Force, now stands guard over a gas station by night, twice wed with no progeny, spending his Saturdays with rod and reel, harboring a quiet dream of one day owning the station, having broken his fast with Eggs Benedict.\n\nIt is this richness, this depth, that you must provide.",
            "In the dim morning light of August, the world unfolded through the flickering screen of a television set in Columbus, Ohio. NBC 4's broadcast carried the weight of tragedy and the stark truth of human frailty. A man named Shad Hostettler, his name a dark whisper on the lips of the anchor, had taken a blade to his wife's flesh, her name lost to the silence of the airwaves. His image, a visage of malevolence, stared back from the screen. The tale told swiftly, a mere breath in the life of the broadcast, yet the shadows of the act lingered long after the story moved on.\n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods night, a bullet lodged in his flesh, his story still untold by the voice of justice. The SWAT team prowled the aftermath, yet no specters of guilt had been seized. The words came and went like a whisper, the brevity of it a wound in itself, a testament to the ghostly indifference that shrouds the suffering of those whose skin bears the hue of the earth.\n\nAnd then the whirring of blades overhead, a Med-Flight helicopter scarred by a bullet's bite, the trajectory traced back to a rifle's .22 caliber breath. A bounty of five thousand dollars lay on the table for any who might guide the hand of justice to the shooter’s door.\n\nThe sky's fury was foretold next, rain and thunder gathering on the horizon, the weather a fleeting specter in the tapestry of the news, a siren's call to keep the watchers tethered to the glow of the screen.\n\nA robbery then, on Clime Road, the shadow of a man cloaked in a hoodie, his skin dark as the night, the words lingered on his description, the color of his skin spoken of as though it held the weight of the crime itself. \n\nLastly, Rene Rodriguez, a name heavy with the sins of a drug kingpin, sentenced for his deeds, the term stretched into 300 months, the length of it a curious choice, perhaps meant to echo louder in the hearts of men. His identity as Hispanic mentioned, a detail like a stray thread in a woven tale. \n\nAnd so the stories wove together, a tapestry of human folly and fate, each a chapter in the endless book of the world.",
            "An exchange traded fund, the ETF, is a security that bears the weight of an index or perhaps some commodity or a basket of assets fashioned in the likeness of an index fund yet with the supple nature of a stock that wanders the exchange. It offers the breadth of an index fund and the singularity of stock ownership with the curious ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold but one share in a single transaction. Its allure is plain and the expense ratios of ETFs lie beneath those of the mutual fund by a long measure. Yet there are shadows, the commission exacted upon each trade like the toll of a stock order. Still, the diversity of funds is wide as the horizon. Though benefits are laid bare, the wary investor will weigh them, question their breadth and depth. In this pursuit, we turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, laying it beside the top ten holdings that make its body and soul, to discern if the single ETF matches the tapestry of owning a varied ten, and whether there is a finer weave of the same stocks that may yield a sharper return.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of the ETF, we focus on the ten holdings that bear 63.58% of its essence. These ten, they stand below, each a fraction of the greater whole.\n\nTo see how these ten speak for the ETF IHF, we take their share of assets and stretch them to fill the hundred, calculating their Beta and Return as if this was the whole of the portfolio, weighted as the ETF has cast them. The figures, they are laid in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain as day that a portfolio of these ten holdings shines with a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% rise in its trail. Its Beta, too, lies .12 beneath the ETF's own mark. It seems this portfolio of ten might offer richer harvests with softer winds. But it is the truth of numbers that the mean of these paths might not diverge as much as they whisper.\n\nTo gauge the difference in these paths, the standard deviation of each stock in the ten is found, stretched to the hundred to compare its sum against the ETF IHF's own sway.",
            "In the cold starkness of Figure 17, one sees a steep decline in the commuter log entries as the third month of the project unfurls its tale. It is a narrative marked by disappointment, an enigma of sorts, and the reasons for it remain shrouded in the shadows of speculation. Winter arrives with an iron grip upon the New England campus, and the numbers of those brave souls venturing forth by bicycle or on foot dwindle in its wake. December makes its entrance, heralding the close of the fall semester, a time where minds are consumed by exams and grades and the myriad tasks that conclude the academic cycle. It is no wonder then that the commuter log, a mere whisper amidst the din, fades from consciousness.\n\nThe holiday season descends, a harbinger of respite, a month-long exile from the duties of academia for students and faculty alike. The campus lies bare, and in its emptiness, the logs dwindle further. As January's end signals a return to scholarly pursuits, the logs remain sparse, February offering little hope of revival. Perhaps it is the nature of such ventures, a bright flare at their inception, only to wane with time. In March, in a bid to rekindle the flame, the Carpool Challenge Week is born, a blitz of effort to breathe life once more into the endeavor. Log submissions rise, a testament to the campaign's success.\n\nYet, the struggle to sustain the momentum of the project is a relentless foe, compounded by the rhythms of holiday and semester breaks that define the world of higher learning. Another adversary lies in the hearts of men and women, a deep-seated love of the freedom and independence found behind the wheel of their own cars. It is a cultural tenet, a truth not easily swayed. To entice the masses towards alternative paths, incentives must be laid out like treasures. Gift certificates to local haunts, restaurants, coffee shops, and beyond were offered, their allure undeniable. Yet, one wonders what might have been wrought by grander prizes—a bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car—vehicles of change that could alter the course of engagement.\n\nThroughout, the nature of the prizes remained a constant, unchanging as the seasons. But what if the stakes had risen? If in December bicycles had been announced, and by the time January arrived, hints of hybrid or electric cars danced before the eyes of the participants? One can only ponder how the numbers might have swelled, how the engagement might have transformed from decline to resurgence. The promise of such rewards might have held the key to a different tale.",
            "In the archives of the Library of Congress lies a collection of early Edison films, wherein I found myself drawn to the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films are a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the cleverness of editing. My study delved into the poetics that pervade the majority of these films, while also casting an eye toward those few that stand as evolutionary outliers. At the dawn of the century, the trick film remained tethered to its stagebound roots, framed by a frontal proscenium, absent of camera movement, comprised of long and medium shots, adhering to the principle of one shot equating to one film. Yet, as the century turned, there emerged films that dared to defy these conventions, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films together is their steadfast reliance on the interior set within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera, resolute in its position, refuses to pursue figures or objects beyond its fixed gaze. This composition harks back to the theatre, to vaudeville, and to magic acts, where the stage is both a boundary and a canvas. The constraint of the stage renders the movement of figures in trick films to a horizontal plane, a dance from side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel from the year 1900. The actors enter from the right, traversing back and forth, yet the camera remains unmoved, indifferent to their absence when they slip beyond its frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip ensures that shots are predominantly long, occasionally medium, but never close. The theatre and vaudeville influence persists, where the audience bears witness to the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's borders. In these early films, actors remain anchored to the middle ground, eschewing the intimacy of close-ups.\n\nIn the nascent days of cinema, trick films followed a simple creed: one conceptual shot equals a film. This confines most to a fleeting minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. It also curtails the dramatic or narrative ambitions, focusing instead on brief vaudevillian tricks—acts of magic, disappearance, and transformation, stories left untold. Yet, in the realm of trick films, one must remember that one conceptual shot does not always equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may be a seamless tapestry of fragments, conjuring the illusion of appearing or vanishing. Observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895. A closer look betrays the moment where Mary's severed \"head\" graces the screen, though to the viewer, the film remains a singular shot.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, the Gothic Novel stands as a curious beacon, an oxymoron of old and new as Ian Watt might say in his chronicling of such tales. This mode, both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness yet celebrated for its terrible sublimity, finds its origins in Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto. Here, ancient and modern are woven together to birth a new form, a Gothic Story as Walpole christened it, a tapestry of old theatrics and the mimicry of the natural world as seen through the eyes of modern literary minds. The Gothic, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, dances in the archaic light of its own making, a relic unsophisticated in the face of modernity’s march. Yet, it is this very duality, the theatrical Gothic entwined with the intimacy of the novel’s form, that grants it longevity, a relic both obsolete and reborn for readers adrift in time.\n\nAmongst the echoes of its pages, chivalry rises as a specter, a vestige of medieval knighthood both preserved and reshaped in Walpole’s creation. The Gothic writers, drawn to this ideal of bravery and honor, saw in the chivalric past a mirror held to their own disenchanted world. The Gothic past becomes a canvas for idealization, a precursor to the Romantic that sought to mend the present's ills. Walpole, writing amidst political unrest, saw the chivalric virtues as a balm for society’s wounds, a lost morality in the din of the present. This yearning is etched in characters like Frederic, a figure painted with strokes of chivalric imagery—a prince, a sufferer of tragedies, a presumed casualty of infidels. In Frederic, the gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated echo, a portent of the Gothic’s embrace of excess, a myth made flesh within the pages of Otranto.\n\nThus, in the Gothic Novel, we find an edifice built from the stones of the past, a shadowed testament to the old and the new, a bridge to the realms of what was and what might yet be.",
            "In the vast and unyielding landscape of commerce, there exists a journey that is neither seen nor heard, yet it moves the world. It is the procession of goods and dreams, from the whispered wants of the customer to the raw earth, through the alchemy of creation and the endless march to the waiting hands of the buyer. This is the domain of supply chain management, a name coined by the prophet Keith Oliver in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two. In his vision, he saw the whole of it, the grand orchestration of planning and action, a dance to satisfy the unceasing hunger of the market. There are six pillars upon which this edifice is built: the birth of goods, their provision, their hoarding, their place, their passage, and the knowledge that binds them. On these the manager must lean, to craft a service that speaks to the heart of the customer.\n\nFirst among these is production, the genesis. It is the bedrock upon which all else rests. Here the when and the why, the where and the how are carved into the stone of intention. The steward of this stage must read the stars, the market, to divine the desires of the people. In this knowing, they chart the course of what shall be made and in what measure. Once the prophecy is clear, they choose the place of creation, the forge best suited to the task. And in this choosing, they heed the twin gods of demand and satisfaction. Then comes the reckoning of labor and the tending of machines, a schedule drawn from the marrow of necessity. Every thread in this tapestry is vital, for a single flaw may unravel the whole. I have walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where every thread is woven with care, each process a solemn rite. Such is the power of design, a beacon against the chaos of uncertainty.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the lifeblood of this endeavor. It is the calculus of strategy, the decisions that shape the bones of a facility and the alliances formed in the crucible of need. A single product may arise from many hands, each division a realm unto itself, with its own tools and toils. The master of this stage must discern which hand best suits each task. At times, the call goes beyond, to other lands, to the altars of outsourcing. For in this, there is velocity, the sacred triad of quality, flexibility, and the eternal quest for a cost that does not bleed the coffers dry. Such is the dance of supply, a testament to the will of those who shape the world unseen.",
            "In the shadow of that bygone era, the novels of the Victorian age stand tall, their pages woven with threads of meticulous detail, their narratives steeped in the lives of the highborn. Yet, there are those tales that wander from this well-trodden path, among them Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, where the air of mystery hangs thick and the peculiar dances in the periphery of the ordinary. Such elements breathe life into the souls of their characters, peeling back layers to reveal the tumult beneath, the hidden urges and the ghosts of their desires.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, ... he found that he was talking to them.... Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the shroud of mystery often descends through dreams or states akin to dreams, their nature shifting with the winds of the narrative. In the story of Oliver Twist, such visions uncover hidden truths about the boy, the shadows that haunt him, and the grim reality that encircles him. When the memory of the shooting is stirred in chapter 28, it unfurls in Oliver's mind like a fevered dream, a cruel reminder of his helplessness and the ravages upon his frail form. The phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunt his thoughts, his senses dulled, oblivious to the unseen hand that sweeps him away. Pain has become his constant companion, a specter intertwined with fear rather than surprise. With his will subsumed, questions arise about the hand that steers his fate, a destiny not of his own making. The shooting stands as testament to Oliver's lack of agency, his inability to grasp the reins of his own survival, even as the specter of death looms. A shadow of surrender creeps into his heart, as if old Fagin's grip tightens, bending him to despair's will, stifling the fire within him that might otherwise rise in defiance.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Years passed since I found myself in the quiet corridors of an after-school program where I took to tutoring young souls not much taller than the desks they sat at. I did what I could to guide them through the tangled thickets of subjects they found troublesome, though my own compass pointed truest toward the realms of English and reading. There was a teacher there, an instructor, who beckoned me to aid a young boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps third or fourth grade, and he wrestled with words as if they were phantoms. It struck me strange how some letters he knew with certainty, and others he could not fathom, like strangers in a familiar town. The boy was of Latino descent, that much was clear, yet his English was unblemished, flawless in speech if not in script. We toiled in that place, him and I, until the day his mother came to the school. \n\nI remember it well. I was tending to a few children who had not gone on some excursion with their fellows when she appeared. She spoke to me in Spanish, and though my grasp of that language was tenuous, we managed to bridge the gulf between us with the few words I did possess. It was in that moment, as if struck by an epiphany, I realized Adrian's struggle was no enigma of reading, but of familiarity with the English alphabet itself. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him in the years to come, I cannot say. Yet I wish him well and trust that the world treated him kindly.\n\nThis tale I recount is a mirror to the broader issue of language barriers that echo through the halls of California's schools. It is a reminder that these obstacles are not always what they seem. Even for those who speak English with grace, reading it can be an insurmountable wall. We know this problem lives among us, so what path do we take? For Adrian, the answer lay in patience and guidance through the letters and sounds of English. Yet for many others, this challenge is a labyrinth with no single thread to lead them out. There is no panacea. The solution lies in weaving together a tapestry of dual language programs, immersive classrooms, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language approach is a seed of promise. It is not simply for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual education soar above their peers. Fear clings to this idea, whispers of wasted effort and benefit to none. But if these programs were the norm instead of the outlier, all children might drink deeply from their well. How do we realize this vision? Not by demanding every teacher bear the burden of bilingualism. Such an expectation is beyond reason. But there is no barrier to enlisting aides, tutors, call them what you will, who carry both languages within them like a gift.",
            "From the tender age when the world is new and unformed, there arises the notion of something vast and ungraspable, a specter of the infinite looming ever just beyond our ken. We are ushered into halls of worship, to Sunday schools or temples, or sent on inward journeys to seek the elusive truths that lie within. Many among us take the faith of our ancestors as our own, a mantle passed down through the ages. Yet others cast it aside, claiming the barren certainty of a world circumscribed by self. We may cling to one creed only to find it wanting and exchange it for another. Each path is a solitary pilgrimage into the recesses of our souls, a search for meaning amidst shadows, for the dawn beyond the night.\n\nIt was on the porch, the rain a steady cadence on the tin roof, that I asked my father his favored bird. \"A cardinal,\" he said, a word spoken into the twilight with the gravity of a man who knows the weight of things unsaid. We sat there, the smoke from our cigarettes mingling with the rain's mist, the gutters a torrent drowning the garden's edge. His gaze fixed upon the falling rain, a look that spoke of seeking and remembering both. Time had thinned him, his clothes now mere drapery over a wasted frame, his hair a sparse memory of what once was. He looked away, eyes averted, and silence fell between us, a chasm I could not cross. I felt the solitude of impending loss, the words lodged in my throat, words that would make the inevitable irrevocable. I reached out, drew my chair near, and together we watched the rain descend upon the June dusk.\n\nDecember came, and with it the final departure. Five days after I marked another year, my father slipped away. The treatments had been futile, a prolongation of pain that defied reason or mercy. I questioned the divine, wondered what god would allow such suffering, found no solace in the night. Prayers faltered on my lips, for if there was a god, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing, the man who had given me life. I chose not to see the end, to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than those who surrounded his final hours, better than his kin, and I knew he would not wish his child to mark his end with eyes full of grief. So I withdrew, wrapped myself in solitude for three days, awaiting the inevitable word.\n\nThe silence was unbroken. No call came.",
            "In the fields of Caroline, where the soil lay thick with the sweat of men, John Taylor stood as a sentinel of Republicanism. His hands were those of an agriculturalist, the earth beneath his nails a testament to his craft, yet his voice rang loud in the halls of politics. A man forged in the fires of his convictions, dedicated to the cause of personal freedom and the governance that would safeguard it. The land was his gospel, and from it he drew the marrow of his beliefs, seeing in its tilling the very essence of sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the laws that bind men.\n\nTaylor gazed upon the young republic and saw a canvas unmarred by ancient rites. Here was a land unshackled, a place where self-government might take root in the rich, untrodden soil. He held fast to the natural rights of man, each right a thread in the tapestry, and if one were cut, the whole would unravel. Such rights must be held beyond the reach of government’s grasping hand. He spoke of the so-called \"state of nature,\" where brute strength and cunning ruled, a world that civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor called for a government that mirrored the duality of man's soul, both light and dark. His creed was simple: \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles were those that guarded private property, nurtured the land, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. A government rooted in such principles would stand firm, its course unaltered by the winds of avarice and self-interest. These were the twin engines of man’s endeavor, yet only when they built upon the public good could they be redeemed. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's inherent darkness, ever watchful lest it stray into shadow.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, held fast to the Constitution’s strict construction. He envisioned a Federal government bound by chains no looser than those spelled out in its sacred text. He knew the cost of a sprawling government, its greed a harbinger of tyranny. Yet he also feared the perils of a literal reading, divorced from the minds that first penned its words. To him, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter, a testament to a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation. In its words, he found the promise of a republic, a promise he held as dearly as the soil beneath his feet.",
            "I looked down into the abyss and the abyss looked back, a flat and unyielding gaze that offered no quarter nor demanded any. The mind, that treacherous vessel of reflection, churned not with thoughts but with the silent acceptance of what lay before it. There was a strange purity to the act, a consciousness unburdened by abstraction, the eyes filling and emptying in a rhythm as ancient as the earth itself. Such was the dance of perception, a fluid encounter with the world that left no trace of itself.\n\nOnce, under the guidance of a fellow creator, I took up a tome titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had harbored a desire to sketch since boyhood, and this book promised to illuminate the path from the mundane to the sublime, from the humble pencil to the mysteries of line and form. It spoke of a frame, a boundary to tame the chaos of sight, to isolate a simple truth in a world of complexity. Imagine, if you will, a bowl of fruit upon a table, a still life amidst the clutter of a kitchen, reduced to its essence by the artist's square.\n\nYet now, as I stood before the porcelain altar, I could not conjure that frame. The enormity of it all, a visceral presence that defied containment, left me rooted in awe. Artists have their phases; Picasso with his blues, Monet with his verdant dreams, and the Renaissance with its symphony of hues. If I were to claim any such vision, it would begin here, in this Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers brushed the tool of my creation, the muscles of my arm a conduit for the will of the mind, shaping the void in a moment that felt pure and unadulterated. The water moved, eddied in its crystalline repose, and the detritus of life surrendered to the flow. Again my hand found the handle, more insistent now, willing the recalcitrant mass to yield to its fate. But it clung stubbornly, a defiant creature in the depths.\n\nWith mop in hand, my stance firm, the tie at my neck a mark of the burden I bore, I cast a weary eye upon the refuse left behind by those who tread the aisles of Rite Aid. A few more attempts, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the roll at my side. Layers of paper ensconced my hand, an improvised gauntlet for the task ahead. Straightening, I bent once more, my hand descending into the water like a pilgrim reaching for the holy relic buried in the earth.",
            "In the waning light of the day, the shadows of the young stretch long across the tarmac and the hum of engines fills the air like some ancient call. They are out there, these teenagers, driving under a sky that holds no mercy, and it is here that they find themselves at the intersection of fate and folly. The National Institutes of Health speak of the unripe minds of these young drivers, their brains not yet carved for the perils of the road. Inexperience, that age-old specter, shadows their every mile, and it is this lack that leads them to calamity—vehicles overturned, the road beneath them slipping away, speed their constant companion.\n\nIn the company of their peers, the weight of wisdom seems to lift, leaving them unanchored, adrift on highways and backroads alike. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth with studies that draw a stark line between the age of passengers and the frequency of their misfortunes. And yet, in response, states like California erect flimsy barricades, provisional licenses that seek to hem in the chaos. But these are but reeds against the tide.\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the very essence of youth. These young drivers, by every account and measure, stand unready for the burden they bear. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman speaks of the wild heart beneath the breast of youth, suggesting that even at eighteen, the fire of risk still burns too bright. USA Today carries his words, a warning of the thrill-seeking urge that dances like a devil on the shoulder of the young. Delay the right to drive, he argues, until the flame subsides.\n\nShould we continue to set these young behind the wheel, their fates will remain entwined with ruin. By 2010, the progeny of the Baby Boomers shall flood the roadways, a generation poised to steer into the unknown. The reckoning of legislation, clear and stark, waits at the horizon. Schools may still guide the hands and minds of future drivers, yet the wheels should not turn for any under eighteen. A provisional path may lead them, requiring hours of practice beneath the watchful eye of an elder. Uniform laws, drawn with a steady hand across the nation, may yet guard the youth from their own undoing.\n\nSuch laws are not new, nor are they revolutionary. They stand instead as a testament to reason, a bulwark against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the vast expanse of human condition there lies a peculiar disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. The mind, that mysterious engine of perception, falters here. It is a disorder that speaks to the inefficiencies of the central nervous system, the way it stumbles over the auditory information that it is meant to decipher. The brain hears, yet does not understand, failing to separate the urgent whispers of words from the clamor of the world. Those who bear this burden hear as others do, yet the translation of sound into meaning is fraught and uncertain.\n\nIn the mid-century past, they spoke of auditory imperception, a term birthed in the studies of children whose communicative paths were obscured. Italian pioneers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, sought to unravel this enigma in 1954, and by 1961, a thinker named Kimura would introduce dichotic testing, a lens into the physiology of the central auditory nervous system. In '77, minds gathered in conference to stir this pool of understanding, to delve deeper into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD, in its many manifestations, is a shadowy adversary. The afflicted may find themselves adrift in sound, unable to pinpoint its source or discern its nature. The dance of acoustic events might confuse them; the subtle shifts in speech tones, the markers of sarcasm or sincerity, elude their grasp. Sounds can overlap like waves upon a shore, obscuring meaning. The sequence of auditory information, meant to guide, becomes a tangled skein.\n\nTo diagnose this disorder is no simple task, for the tools are many and the paths are unclear. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others peer into the depths of listening behaviors, seeking clarity. Yet, there is no singular test that holds the promise of certainty. The process involves observing responses to sound, discerning the nuances of auditory perception. The patient is presented with a cacophony, asked to make sense of it, to sift the signal from the noise. In some cases, the very echoes within the ear are measured, searching for that which might reveal the workings of the mind.\n\nThere remains no known cause for this disorder, no single path to diagnosis. It lingers in the shadows of understanding, a testament to the complexities of the human brain and the sounds that encompass it.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling to social work, I've set my sights on laboring with the Division of Family and Children Services. A path laid out to shield the young from harm and to offer solace to families adrift. Values I bring forth to this field are woven with service, respect, ethical fortitude, a relentless commitment to mend the bonds between souls, and a ceaseless quest for my own betterment in this craft. These values, they are not mere words for social workers to wield; they are the very marrow of my being.\n\nAlways have I yearned to lend a hand to others, yet the road remained shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many turned their backs on their demons, cloaked in denial, while some clung to frail crutches of their own making. Bearing witness to such tales, I steered toward a degree in Psychology. But when the ink was dry on my diploma from Piedmont College, the path was still veiled, so I paused. That summer, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxious upon a couch. His tale was one of escape from the talons of abuse. The next dawn, he spoke to the law of the shadows in his own home. I found myself standing at the threshold of that house, voicing my concerns to the officers, a fresh graduate of Psychology. The law, bound by its own limits, asked me to parley with the parents. Their words were nervous, their son painted as a trickster, embroiling outsiders in their \"simple\" family quarrels. It was in that moment, the seed of social work took root in me.\n\nYet another pillar of this sacred labor is social justice. A society claims to cherish the individual, grieving the lost, yet clinging to the vestiges of old ways that stifle true singularity. If we mourn the departed, why this relentless march toward sameness? I stand apart, refusing to bind myself to the mold of others. Through school and beyond, I stood in defiance of social wrongs. My hair bore the colors of rebellion, my attire a testament to self, my ears adorned in defiance of tradition. I staked my claim with the GSBA, stood against the tide of racism and discrimination, and I shall not cease. For in the heart of social justice, beats the rhythm of my soul, and against injustice, I shall always rise.",
            "In the quiet hours when the world slumbers, there lies a disorder that steals the night away like a thief in the shadows. Insomnia, they call it. And in the pages of this discourse, we delve into the tangled web of the Biological and Sociocultural models, casting light on the restless dark. The biological model speaks in the tongue of genetics and the nuances of medical science, its gaze fixed on the inherited intricacies of our being. Meanwhile, the sociocultural model turns its eye to the vast tapestry of human interaction, to the interplay of race, ethnicity, and the weight of socioeconomic chains. This examination of insomnia walks the line between these worlds, tracing the path of research that seeks to unravel and clarify. Each study chosen stands as a solitary figure, its strengths and flaws laid bare beneath the scrutiny of critique.\n\nSleep disorders, those spectral maladies that haunt the night, are no simple matter. They may stride forth as primary afflictions or lurk beneath the surface, tied to the mind's other torments. Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, they are called. The former wrestles with the act of sleep itself, the latter with the strange occurrences that transpire in that realm. Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy—they are as specters named, each with its own tale of woe. And while the Dyssonmias grapple with the very act of surrendering to sleep, the Parasomnias hold court in the domain of nightmares and wandering phantoms. The mind, with its Axis I and Axis II disorders, casts its own long shadow over the world of sleep, and in this review, we turn our gaze to insomnia, ever in the context of these models.\n\nIn the realm of biology, where genes are the architects of fate, sleep disorders find their roots. In the depths of the hypothalamus, neurons, like sentinels, hold sway over the borderlands of sleep and wakefulness. A study, conducted with mice as its subjects, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, silent arbiters of the sleep-wake cycle. The GABAA receptor, when stirred, beckons sleep to the weary, but when silenced, it ushers in tranquility and slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the hours of rest, a promise whispered to the human soul. Such findings suggest a kinship between man and beast, a shared lineage of genetic and environmental threads. Within this lies a cautionary tale: the absence of this receptor may rob one of the peace of sleep, leaving them adrift in the waking world. The sociocultural echoes of this revelation speak of inherited burdens, of sleep unraveled by the unseen hand of fate, casting long shadows over the pursuits of life—be it in the fields of learning, labor, or the mundane rhythm of the everyday.",
            "At University Park, I've found myself tethered to the earth for nigh on two and a half years, a span of semesters that stretch and fold like the plains of a desolate land. The campus itself a vast expanse, where the burden of traversing its breadth weighs heavily on students like myself, a pilgrimage from east to west. Freshman year saw me housed in East Halls, a dormitory perched on the edge of the campus world, beyond which lay the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center, specters in the distance. To venture from Stuart Hall to the center, to Willard amidst the heart of it all, took near a half-hour when the heavens unleashed their wrath, which they oft do in State College. An alum, not so distant in years, recounted days when East Halls lay beyond a barren expanse. Now, filled with fields and edifices, the campus stretches its sinews ever tauter, making passage a trial. The bicycle, then, is the answer, a savior in spokes. Yet alone it cannot suffice. The riders must embrace it, and the paths must yield to their wheels.\n\nA friend, a prodigal to the saddle, spoke of the bicycle's allure. \"Bikes are great,\" he confessed, as if recalling a lost lover. \"For years, it seemed folly to ride, but it is the only way.\" In the churn of pedals and breath, one finds a journey many miles fueled by mere oats and resolve. Like many, I dwell beyond the campus bounds, as far as the dorms themselves. A wise choice it was to procure a bicycle, for to Thomas building I must go, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot reduced to five by the grace of a swift pedal. Yet Pollock Road, the straight course to Thomas, is a treacherous vein, fraught with trials for man and machine alike. There is merit in walking, a journey of contemplation, yet time is a cruel master. Without the bike, my steps would be my sole recourse, a daily march to Thomas stealing precious minutes, hours from my week. Time I cannot spare, spent in the ceaseless rhythm of the walk.",
            "In the bleak pages of Aldous Huxley's vision, there lies a world where the iron grip of technology entwined with the sinews of capitalism forges a dystopia of chilling precision. Brave New World stands as a testament to the collective's triumph over the soul of the individual, where the people, from the cradle, are bred to chase the fleeting ghost of happiness above all else. They walk as pawns upon a board vast and inscrutable, their lives penned by the hand of the World Controller who whispers a single creed. Through the lens of Marxist theism, the specter of suspicion looms large, drawing a line from the author's time to ours, where the machinery of economy ticks ever onward. The lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—echoes through the corridors of Huxley's prose, a commentary on the fractures within the new world he saw rising.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare, a satire sharpened by the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to the wheel of economic fortune, seek only their own gain, their eyes turned from the truth of their condition. Ideology weaves its net tight around the proletariat, the laborers, seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's inhabitants. The Deltas, the Gammas, their wills hollowed out, taught in sleep to consume, to spend, to seek indulgence above all else, are puppets to the World Controller's design. Hegemony, the silent dominion of one class over another, holds them in thrall, unaware of the bars of their gilded cage, yet they buy into the creed of capitalism, consumerism. The Alphas, the Betas, gifted with awareness, do little more than acquiesce, save for a lone Bernard who dares to question. In the interactions across these social divides, the tale reveals the shadow of capitalistic oppression, a theme ripe for dissection.\n\nIn such a world, connections falter, and individuals become ghosts of themselves. Huxley's narrative, stark and unyielding, paints his characters as figures in a landscape, their depths unfathomed, their essence obscured. Perhaps, Huxley muses, it is the union of technology and capitalism that robs a man of his will, his voice. Love is an echo, emotion a shadow, their interactions shallow, the men’s talk of women reduced to object and form, the women’s talk of encounters shameless and bare. Each class, snug in its rung upon the ladder, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unyielding obedience to community, a reflection of Marxist beliefs, speaks of the proletariat's false sense of superiority, as they consume, obey, march in step with their brethren.",
            "In the years that have passed since I first stepped into that classroom at CBC and listened to the lectures on Islam, a quiet storm has brewed in the way the world grapples with the faith of a billion souls. In those discussions, fierce as the desert wind, we grappled with the question of Islam’s nature. Is it a faith of the sword or one of peace? This inquiry echoes more insistently now with the passage of time. The world has looked upon the smoldering ruins of towers in New York and watched how the media’s gaze has shifted from an unyielding glare to an embrace compelled by tolerance, a strange dance of acceptance and suspicion. In those days of ash and fire, who would have dreamed a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of a Muslim lineage, might aspire to the highest office in the land?\n\nThe life of the Prophet, Muhammad, is a tapestry woven with threads both light and dark. The tales spun of him often seem at odds with the evidences of history. It was said that he bent tribes to his will, wielding faith as a blade to carve out a new world. Yet the pages of his biography paint him as a saint misunderstood, a martyr for a cause greater than himself. It is told that he did not demand conversion at the point of a sword, but rather the truth of his words drew men to him as iron to a lodestone.\n\nThere is an uncanny echo in his acts and those of another man from long ago, a carpenter’s son who walked the shores of Galilee. Stories of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk for forty men call to mind the loaves and fishes, and I wonder if the pen sought to recast him as a humble prophet, a man of miracles who needed no proofs but lived in the fullness of truth. Such tales, to me, seem a shadow of the greater light, a reflection seeking to claim the brilliance of Christ’s life and deeds.\n\nThe accounts in his biography often speak of witnesses, of those who came willingly into the fold of Islam. Yet these stories are like whispers carried on the wind, always heard from another’s lips and never firsthand. Their aim is to bolster belief, yet to me, they strip the stories of their flesh, leaving them bare and wanting.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the effort to lift Muhammad to heights of sanctity, to paint him as a paragon of virtue and humility. History tells a tale that diverges from this image, and I wonder if those who follow him know the fullness of his path to power. The truth, like the desert sands, shifts and changes, elusive to those who seek it.",
            "In the shadow of time’s passing, the words and ways of Jesus, once clear as a river running beneath the vast sky, were soon left upon the shores of history. As the ages turned, Christianity, like a great tree growing wild, branched away from the source of its seed. One may observe in the wide sweep of history a faith drifting from its beginnings, the echoes of its past dim and distant. In the world of today, there rises a restless awakening, an urge towards something new and yet old. The traditionalists hold fast, clutching the teachings passed to them from their forebears, but their grip may not suffice to steer the course of the whole. Amongst the faithful, a deepening sense of history shall bloom in the years to come. A hunger shall stir to separate the doctrines layered upon Christianity through the ages from the essence of the man who walked the earth in its name. It is whispered in the winds of time that this journey backward may span decades, even centuries. Yet its end is written in the stars: a great reversal shall unfold, a return to origins. A movement shall rise, peeling away the layers of doctrine as if turning back the hands of a clock, leaving bare the simple truth that Jesus bestowed upon humankind, untouched by later minds. As this tide sweeps across the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes to worship as in the days of old, the church will stand firm as a beacon. But with the theological clock wound back, the multitude of Christian beliefs shall converge into a singular, harmonious voice. Across regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, differences shall dissolve into unity. History is a tapestry of reversals. Once, the Roman Empire cast Christians into the shadows of persecution, only to later become a bastion of their faith. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery give way to the rise of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold upon the stage of Christianity, unraveling the tapestry of time in search of its source, smoothing the wrinkles of diversity. This path shall be paved by a new reading of Jesus’ words, not as the letter of the law but as the poetry of metaphor. And so, what has transpired since Jesus walked the earth? In the annals of history, there lies Judaism, the bedrock from which Christianity sprang. Monotheism, the divine revelations, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures formed its core long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not a single voice but many—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each with their own song.",
            "In the desolate heart of Sinclair's Jungle, the truth of man's greed is laid bare, stripped of pretense or mercy. Beneath the veneer of civilization lies a selfish core, a hunger that drives men to seek their own fortune while casting aside those beneath them. The great factories rise like monoliths against the sky, steely and indifferent, their masters concerned only with the glory of their own empires. They care not for the collateral damage, for the lives trampled in their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair's prose cuts like a knife, drawing a stark image of the world they create. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" It is a world suffocating under the weight of its own ambition, the air thick with smoke and the ground stained with the refuse of life.\n\nThe captains of industry are blind to the suffering of their workers, seeing only the glint of a dollar. They are men without loyalty, their decency traded for profit. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They drive their workers like cattle, merciless and unyielding, casting them aside without a thought when they no longer serve their purpose. In the era of The Jungle, laws are scarce and justice a distant dream, leaving the laborers at the mercy of their masters. They toil in squalor, live in misery, and die in obscurity, forgotten by the world they helped build. The unions, meant to be their salvation, are often as corrupt as the system they oppose, preying on the very people they claim to protect. Sinclair lays bare the harsh reality, the workers akin to slaves in this modern age, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a tale of darkness, of a world where hope is a flickering candle against the unrelenting night.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his own favored works, a testament to the macabre and the ethereal. In this poem, the name \"Thulé\" arises twice, at lines 6 and 56, a nod that Mabbott traces back to Virgil. That ancient poet spoke of an island northward, a place where the known world frayed into mystery and myth. But more than Virgil's distant shores, it is the Germanic whispers that capture Poe's imagination. His fascination with the Teutonic authors is well known, and in this, one finds a connection to Goethe, the illustrious scribe of \"Faust.\"\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his scholarly musings over Poe and Goethe, draws a line between them, suggesting an echo of imitation. Goethe, he who penned the tragic tale of \"The King of Thulé,\" a king bereft and broken by the death of his queen, clinging to a goblet that spoke of loss and longing. That same king, in his sorrow, cast the goblet into the sea and found his own end upon a lonely cliff. There is in this tale a shadowy reflection of Poe's own \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps a dark twin born of grief and the solace of drink, mirroring Poe's own demons.\n\nIn the Oxford tome of English letters, Goethe is celebrated for \"Faust,\" a drama split across the years of his life, culminating in the year of his passing, 1832. And within this work, the mournful tale of \"The King of Thulé\" finds its place. It is a tale of desolation, much like the landscape of Poe's dreamscape, where the air is thick with ghosts and the world is drained of its colors. So it is that \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" might be read as twin paths through the same somber forest.\n\nPoe, too, speaks of Thule, twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing it in the same mythic isolation. It is as if Poe walked the same spectral paths as Goethe's king, both haunted by phantoms of the past. For Poe, Goethe was a figure of significance, known to him perhaps through the lens of Tennyson, another poet of renown whom Poe admired. In the echoes of Tennyson's respect, Poe might have found the Germanic voice of Goethe, resonating through the years and the shadows of his own dark imaginings.",
            "In the land of sun and promise where the Pacific beats its endless dirge upon the shore, there lies a question of law and consequence. A woman, Jennifer Palmer by name, found herself lain low upon the hard tiles of a grocery store, felled not by fate but by the slick betrayal of applesauce. The law of California, with its statutes and codes, turns upon itself to ask if such a fall might yield more than the recompense for her pain. Might it, in its turning, render punitive damages upon the keeper of the store, one Paul Martin, who sat idly with his dinner as the spill lay unheeded?\n\nThe judge, a figure of solemn judgment, may hold his hand from dismissing Palmer's claim so easily. For the law demands that to seek punitive damages, one must show that the actions of the accused were not only careless but carried with them a willful and knowing disregard for the harm they would wreak. The conduct must be shown as despicable, a word heavy with moral weight. Palmer, with her counsel, will argue that Martin should have seen the harm coiled in that spill, for it was not the first of its kind. In the months before her fall, others had met the floor with equal violence, and yet Martin did nothing.\n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, 2009, the clock marked five in the afternoon when a young man named Rich Wayne, servant of D&D Markets, spoke to his superior, Paul Martin, of the applesauce's peril. Martin, breaking his bread, dismissed it as a minor annoyance. A quarter-hour passed and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan's, rose with the same warning. Martin's reply was unchanged. The clock moved on and at half-past five, Palmer fell.\n\nThe courts of California allow for punitive damages to be sought when a wrong is done with oppression, fraud, or malice. The law paints malice as an act intended to harm or, failing intent, an act so vile as to be done with a conscious disregard for the safety of others. In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., the court spoke of malice as a thing aware of its own danger yet choosing still to proceed. In the quiet halls of justice, these words will echo as Palmer seeks recompense for the injury borne of Martin's neglect.",
            "She had always felt a want like a hunger in her soul, a yearning that would not be sated. It had crept upon her at fourteen, the tender age when one begins to step into the shadowed paths of adolescent life. By seventeen it still lingered, unresolved and unrelenting. She had come to reckon it wasn't a thing she sought but a someone, yet no boy had ever stirred her heart. Suitors had approached, stumbling over themselves in the awkward dance of courtship, but none held her interest. She found herself pondering this enigma, wondering what peculiarity of spirit could cause such a deviation from the expected course of a young girl's life. She spun theories like a spider spins its web, but none held her fast. So she continued onward, ever questioning the nature of her desires.\n\nThe days at home were a gentle affair. Her parents were folk of quiet dispositions, their lives free of discord. Rarely did cross words pass between them, and scarcely ever with their daughter. Their disputes, if they could be called that, revolved around her fierce independence, the unyielding spirit that defined her. She was a child of calm souls, yet she brought a liveliness that countered their placid ways, endearing her to many with a charmed personality and a genuine kindness.\n\nYet today the tranquility was shattered. As she wandered the house in search of some spark to light her imagination, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. A sound that was her mother's voice. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the scene, her heart pounding with dread. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out, finding her mother sprawled upon the floor, her face twisted in pain, breathless whispers of \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out in desperate aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, squeezed out through the agony, and the daughter knew her mother suffered greatly. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and at that moment, the girl felt gratitude for the strength she had honed through practice. She gathered her mother in her arms, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back as if she were laying down the most precious of burdens.\n\nThe hospital loomed with its scent of antiseptic and the omnipresent air of dread. But the girl was unfazed by these things, her mind consumed with the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice calling out for the aid of the doctors. Faces tightened with concern surrounded them, and swiftly a rolling bed was brought forth, her mother gently placed upon it. They whisked her away to the sterile haven where ailments are met with care, and the daughter was left in the waiting room, alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a stepping stool, reaching high for a vase nestled in the uppermost cabinet of their home.",
            "In the quiet march of time, the study sought to unravel a truth about the Mediterranean way of eating, a diet of the ancients, transmuted into a modern form they called the aMed diet. It was a beacon in the heart of uncertainty, proposing that those who walked its path might find themselves less beset by the spectral hands of chronic heart disease and the stillness of stroke. This aMed diet, a shadow of its ancestral form, was a tapestry woven with the fruits of the earth, the proteins of plants save for the humble potato, and the bounties of the sea. It eschewed the heavy hand of saturated fats for the grace of monounsaturated oils and allowed the gentle touch of alcohol in moderation.\n\nIn the annals of prospective studies, there lay evidence of this diet's power, its inverse dance with the specter of mortality, both total and cardiovascular. Intervention too had shown the diet's might, surpassing the meager offerings of low-fat regimes in the battles of weight and the alchemy of cholesterol in the bulwarks of obesity. Yet the stroke, that sudden thief of vitality, had eluded these chronicles until now.\n\nThe study cast its net over the lives of 74,886 women, aged between 38 and 63 years, untouched by the ravages of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, members of that grand congregation known as the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from the year of our Lord 1984 to the year 2004, the learned authors drew forth the aMed diet scores from the women's own accounts of their sustenance, a ritual of self-report known as the food frequency questionnaire. Through two decades, the steadfast majority stayed true, their declarations subject to the scrutiny of validation studies. Reports of heart disease, of fatal heart disease, and stroke were sifted from the chaff of uncertainty by the hands of medical record, autopsy, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records lay absent, the cases were deemed probable, a shadow of certainty, yet included nonetheless.\n\nTo lessen the noise of random chance and better echo the truth of long-term dietary intake, the scholars calculated averages, drawing from the well of repeated measures over the years. Confounders, those tricksters that might mislead the unwary, were accounted for, adjusting for age, the smoke of tobacco, the weight of body mass, the tides of menopause and its hormonal travelers, the tablets of multivitamins, the indulgence of alcohol, the vigor of physical activity, and the salve of aspirin.\n\nThe statisticians employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a tool to peer into the relationship between the aMed score and the specters of heart disease and stroke, casting separate nets for the fatal and the nonfatal.\n\nIn the quiet tallying of two decades, they found that those who adhered more closely to the Mediterranean path, scoring higher on the aMed scale, had fewer encounters with the shadows of heart disease and stroke. In those years, 2391 new cases of heart disease arose, 1763 strokes were counted, and 1077 souls were claimed by the combined force of heart disease and stroke. Women in the upper echelons of the aMed score knew less of these shadows than their counterparts in the lower rungs, the relative risk standing at 0.71, a testament to the diet's quiet strength.",
            "The sign stands alone like a monolith on the street corner, a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page, the actress from that film Juno, her eyes reflecting something far off and distant. On the sign, a message scrawled in black Sharpie: Hitler is alive in Burma. Burma, or Myanmar as some call it now, a land under the iron grip of a military junta since the cold coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to a stirring, a gathering of voices that had lain dormant for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes, a color that would name their revolution, marched in defiance, their chants rising like smoke against the oppressive sky. The people watched, waited, and then joined, their patience waning as the junta's tolerance turned to violence. The monasteries, sacred and silent, became battlegrounds, the military storming in like wolves among sheep. Foreign eyes were not welcome, and those who dared to look, like the Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, paid with their lives. The official count stands at thirteen dead, but whispers from a defector, Colonel Hla Win, tell of thousands, their bodies hidden from the world's view.\n\nThis is the world we know, where power seeks to silence the whispers of dissent with the iron fist of history. The Romans, emperors by divine right, ruled with a will as hard as the stones of their roads. In Japan, the emperors claimed divinity, leading their people through the ages of swords and technology. Across the ocean, the president named George, his counsel with preachers of ignorance, a strange echo of those who came before.\n\nThe tales of tyranny are many, like shadows cast long by the setting sun. In 1989, in the vastness of Tiananmen, they gathered, those who dared to dream of freedom. The numbers of the dead are lost in the fog of war, the truth a casualty as much as the bodies. Rwanda, a land torn by hatred, saw the Hutu rise against the Tutsi, the blood of innocents spilled in a government-sanctioned madness. And then there was Hitler, the architect of an era of darkness, his Reich spreading like a plague until the world itself burned.\n\nThese are the stories of our time and times past, the cycles of power and blood that turn like the seasons, unyielding and eternal.",
            "The long shadow of Duke Ellington stretches across the vast expanse of jazz, a testament to his enduring presence and the artful hand he wielded in shaping his orchestra. His touch upon the piano is as a whisper in the night, subtle and pervasive, but as a composer, he spun tapestries of sound rich and intricate, each thread woven with the skill of a master craftsman. Ellington built a stage upon which soloists might dance, unfettered and free, yet also wrote with the precision of a watchmaker, crafting phrases that called forth the unique timbre of each player, drawing out the heart of the orchestra itself. It was in this alchemy of sound that he forged something new, sounds that stood apart, that sang with their own voice.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s innovation, naming Creole Love Call as a testament to his use of the voice as an instrument of jazz, a voice that paints with broad strokes, unhindered by the fetters of words. This piece is a tapestry, six choruses in all, each a departure and a return:\n\nChorus one, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins smooth as silk, only to grow ragged and raw. The second chorus is a muted trumpet, twisting the melody like a river bends, blue notes stretching out like shadows at sundown. A clarinet then takes the stage, soaring high as a bird on the wind, the piano beneath it an undercurrent of syncopation. The fourth chorus brings the band in full, echoing the call and response, brass and reeds entwined in a dance. The fifth chorus climbs to its peak, the reeds now leading, high and wild, as the brass and rhythm hold the time. The sixth, a return to the beginning, the voice now growling, a beast of an instrument. A brief tag, a vocal run, the trombone a discordant end.\n\nEllington’s use of the voice as a brush to paint tone upon the canvas of his work is but one stroke in his legacy. In Hot and Bothered, recorded but a year later, Ellington’s hand is as precise as ever, orchestrating with an ear for the colors of sound. A dialogue between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, the vocal strains of the trumpet and the instrumental notes in Cox’s voice weave together, rich and full. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further still, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, a staple of Ellington’s orchestra, his sound a cornerstone upon which the music is built.",
            "In the vast theater of the natural world, creatures evolve as if guided by the hands of some unseen clockmaker, their changes both mysterious and inevitable. The constraints of this evolution, the unseen walls that shape their path, remain as elusive as the shadows at dusk. D’Arcy Thompson, in the year of our Lord 1917, mused that the language of mathematics had scarcely touched the simplest of organic forms, and the echo of his words lingers even now. Yet in recent times, the lens of mathematical modeling peers into the very essence of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage of these creatures through the ages as Raup and Stanley once did in the year 1981. Our inquiry delves into the realm of Prunum, where mathematical modeling entwines with experimentation to uncover the secrets of evolutionary change, both in direction and magnitude.\n\nWe turn to the x-ray's cold gaze upon the Prunum species, where the language of numbers delineates the parameters of skeletal form, feeding them into the maw of a program named CerioShell, born of Stone’s mind in 1995. From this crucible emerge visions of shells both imagined and real, their morphologies whispering of the boundaries that bind Prunum’s evolutionary dance. These findings, in concert with the hands-on touch of experiment and the art of description, seek to unravel the tapestry of macroevolution within this lineage.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and transformation, is a tube that winds its way through the ages, twisting upon itself in its eternal spiral. These revolutions, these whorls, encircle an imaginary axis, a pillar known as the columella. The whorls grow at varying paces, divided by the suture, a seam that marks their passage. The final and largest whorl, the body whorl, stands apart from the spire, composed of the whorls that precede it. At the spire’s tip lies the apex, and at its opposite end, the base. The creature within extends through the aperture, the gateway of its shell.\n\nGaze upon these shells from every angle: the apical, the basal, the apertural, and the abapertural. In the usual view, the aperture faces the observer, the apex reaching skyward. To count the whorls, one must peer from the apex, discern the first suture’s beginning, and draw a line that cleaves the shell. From this line, the whorls are counted, estimated to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nEach shell is a chronicle, a story of apertures traveling through the corridors of time and space, as the creature builds its home. This journey can be traced, mapped with coordinates marking each whorl’s aperture, its radii both horizontal and vertical.\n\nSuch a path can be rendered in the language of graphs and equations. And once this mathematical tapestry is woven, it becomes possible to alter the course of the mollusk’s skeletogenesis, changing the very nature of its creation.",
            "In that sprawling archipelago where the sun rises over endless seas, the rate at which the very breath of newborns is stilled has hung constant, a grim measure unyielding across a decade's passage. While Indonesia strides toward the distant light of the Millennium's promises, the path for mothers and their babes remains shrouded, the goals unmet and the hands of the clock relentless. Beneath the surface, the reasons for this faltering become clear—an ailing system calls for healing, not mere patches upon its wounds.\n\nAnd yet, there are signs of life, for the cries of birth now more often echo with the presence of skilled hands. Seventy-two of every hundred births now find such guidance, though it is a guidance of tradition. Old ways persist in the guise of midwives, unable to stem the tide when blood flows too freely, leaving a trail of mothers claimed by hemorrhage. It is a promise half-kept, a statistic that whispers of progress yet hides the truth of the road still to tread. Meanwhile, the young suffer in silence, fewer now seeking the healer’s touch for the scourge of diarrheal affliction, and in postnatal care, the story is yet unwritten, incomplete and troubling in its scarcity.\n\nIn the cities, beneath the concrete and steel, the knife of the surgeon finds its place, though in the rural lands, it remains a stranger. Four in a hundred births see the cesarean's deliverance, a number that betrays the inequity between the bustling urban and the quiet rural. The chasm between the rich and the poor yawns wide, a testament to the burden of coins that weigh heavy in the hands of the destitute, blocking their path to healing.\n\nAs the nation ponders the road ahead, a question looms like a specter—how to mend that which is broken? Should the focus be on the specific, the immediate, or should it lay upon the broader canvas of the health system entire? The allure of the targeted, the swift, is undeniable. To seize upon a single thread and pull, to watch it unravel with purpose, is a tempting thought. But beware the cost, for to pour all into one vessel is to leave others dry, and the weavers of health will flock to where the gold is bright. The tale of one illness finds its echo in the neglect of another, a dance of resources uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers that stifle the very breath of progress.",
            "In the expanse of a century, the catalog of Popular Music has swelled to encompass so many divergent strains and offshoots that one might find it a futile endeavor to name them all. And therein lies the tangle, for each genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to scribble but a few—has given rise to its own broods of sub-genres, and those to sub-sub-genres, a lineage unbroken and unending. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, stands as a testament to this evolution, having burgeoned into one of the most variegated and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in the spectrum of emotions it conjures, though the shadows often find their home therein. Its diversity is a testament to its malleability, a trait recognized early by those who wielded it, who bent it to their own designs, and so begat a multitude of sub-genres, a cycle that endures to this day.\n\nWe find ourselves now amid a labyrinth of heavy metal, where the myriad niches defy simple classification. It has absorbed the essence of other genres, yet like all things, it has its origins. To truly grasp the metal that permeates today's airwaves, one must first delve into the metal movement itself, for it is a movement, a force, rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal is, in essence, a movement clad in darkness. It is a music of excess—excess in bass, in volume, in ferocity, in spectacle. It casts aside the primitive for the complex; the musicians within its fold wield their instruments with a mastery that echoes through their creations. And as it may come as no revelation, metal is a movement that walks hand in hand with the specter of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove its adherents to the brink, birthing records that traversed the realms of the strange and the surreal, each note an echo of the substances that inspired them. It embraced the dark, the visceral, a novelty in a world where much of popular music shied from such shadows. The later progeny of metal drew from this well, finding kinship with the Romantic Era's own dalliance with darkness, visceral and unyielding. The lyrics, etched in darkness, are the heart of this movement.\n\nThese words from Helter Skelter reveal the Beatles' shadowed side. They chart the crests and troughs, ostensibly a nod to the influence of drugs. Some hold this song as the harbinger of Heavy Metal, born of a challenge, a riposte to a Rolling Stones tune that tread on the heavier, unlit paths. The Beatles, not to be outdone, inscribed it onto The White Album, a testament to their own capacity for heaviness.",
            "In the years before the surrealists cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who fashioned dreams from the very fabric of his soul. His painting, The Dream, born in 1910, stands not merely as an image of a woman awash in the mysteries of a dreamt jungle but as a testament to Rousseau’s own aspirations, both spoken and unspoken, as an artist. He longed for the nod of approval, the embrace of his peers, and the applause of those who knew art's language. Yet, he stood at a crossroad, a silent war within him, torn between two paths: to tread the well-worn road of conformity, painting in a manner that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of acceptance, or to carve his own passage, to be a beacon of singularity in a world of echoes.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first walk through the corridors of Rousseau’s life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, the son of a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who thrived in the modest comfort of bourgeois life, young Henri knew not the teachings of art’s masters. Instead, he toiled in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a collector of tolls, though the world remembers him as a douanier, a customs man. His life bore the scars of grief, the passing of Clémence, his first wife, and the loss of eight children, leaving him with Julia, his daughter, and sorrow so deep it sought the solace of a brush and canvas. Unlike those who romanticized the peasant’s plight, Rousseau painted not with sentimentality but with the earnest dreams of a man of his time and place.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is a tale of context and circumstance. Untrained in the refined techniques, he began his journey at an age when others had already made their mark. In the shadow of giants, he labored, seeking his place as Matisse and the like carved their own legends. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of this dichotomy, the contrast between Rousseau and Matisse, each driven by different demons. Matisse, wary of the banal, sought to break free from it, while Rousseau, with every stroke, hoped to weave a tapestry so conventional that it might unlock the gates of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet spaces between the lines of the world, there lies an understanding that needs no words. Many a mind has sought to draw the lines between the good and the beautiful, to find where truth and beauty meet. There is something deep and unspoken that ties these together, as if whispered by the earth itself. Keats, in his eternal reflection upon a Grecian urn, spoke of beauty and truth as one and the same. And so, it seems that the heart knows the good and the beautiful without the need for lessons or learning. These are not taught in the schools of man but come as whispers from the world itself. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, they do not command but rather reveal. They do not dictate the path but show the way the light falls upon it. We study them not to lay down laws but to understand the heart of what makes a thing right or a piece of art worthy. In our critiques, we wander through fields of thought, unable to capture fully the essence of what we chase, for some things are beyond the reach of words. The Mona Lisa's smile, it holds secrets that elude the grasp of explanation, as if to say, there's just something about it. \n\nWords fall short, as O'Connor knew, for what is in the heart of a story cannot be captured by mere statement. We speak of art, of morals, and yet there is always something left unsaid, a shadow that dances just beyond the edge of the firelight. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond expression, and in that, we find a truth that connects the beauty we see to the good we feel, a bond that is woven into the fabric of our being.\n\nIn the realm where soul touches soul, art and morality stand together, both felt more deeply than they can be explained. They speak to us in a language of the heart, in the quiet voice of what is beyond the veil. Literature, more than any other, carries within it the pulse of morality, the whisper of values that echo through life itself. It is here, in the pages that turn with the wind of time, where we find the weight of what is right, the light of what is beautiful. And so it is, the stories we tell, they are the bridges between what is and what ought to be, between the seen and the unseen, between the good and the beautiful.",
            "In the land of Germany as we now see it, there lies a strength borne from unity, a tapestry of culture that stretches from the shadowed alps of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This same spirit courses through the veins of Köln along the Rhine and threads its way to the Saxon heart of Dresden on the Elbe. A culture so singular yet woven from threads of varied tribes and distant echoes, it stands as a testament to the many sources from which Germany has sprung.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, holds within its name a mystery that has long beguiled the minds of scholars and historians alike. Tacitus spun a tale of the Tungrians, a tribe of ancient repute, claiming they bore the name Germans before they dared the crossing of the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of conquest, spoke of the Germans, borrowing a name from the very foes he sought to subdue, a name that marked the divide between the known and the unconquered. The Gauls had their word, Germanus, to set apart those not yet brought to heel. Some wise in etymology suggest the name arose from a neighbor’s tongue, a word of demarcation or perhaps from the spear, the ger, wielded with fearsome might, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout to pierce the air, a testament to their clamor in battle.\n\nTacitus, in the year of our Lord ninety-eight, penned his thoughts on the origins of these people in De Origine et situ Germanorum. He saw them as a race untouched by the migrations and minglings of others, rooted, steadfast. “For who among the travelers would leave the sunlit lands of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germany, with its unkind skies and somber ways, unless it were his homeland?”\n\nAnd what Roman would forsake the opulence of Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their legions to the edges of Germania, seeking riches and skirmishes, yet their hearts longed for the marble halls of their empire. The Germanic tribes, appearing as shadows at the empire's border, traded in goods borne of the earth and lent their swords to Roman legions, biding their time as history unfolded its relentless march.",
            "In the dimming light of Illyria, where the shadows of men and women entwine in the dance of deception, the play Twelfth Night casts a somber truth. Disguise, a tool of cunning, serves its master well in orchestrating the symphony of deceit, yet in its final act demands a reckoning. A soul, clad in borrowed garb too long, risks dissolution in the masquerade, a ghost adrift between reality and illusion. To tear away the veil is to stand exposed, alienated from those who once walked beside you. Thus, the heart must choose its tether—self-preservation or the fragile bonds of kinship. For some, the unmasking is met with silent acceptance, yet others take affront, scorning the artifice with wounded pride.\n\nIn the realm of gender, this deception weaves a more complex tapestry, unraveling questions of identity and the impetus to forsake one's true visage. Viola, cast upon these shores, dons the guise of a man—a shield against the world's predations. “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” she confides, her voice a whisper in the gathering dusk. But in this guise, she finds herself severed from the sisterhood, a stranger among her own. Olivia, beguiled by the semblance of a man, mistakes her heart's desire, entwining her fate with the mistaken identity of Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,” she pleads, lost in the labyrinth of love and misconception. And there lies Orsino, whose words to the boy echo with unspoken longing: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nIn the eyes of the modern, this play unfolds as a map of hidden desires, its characters ensnared by the deceptions that lay bare their heart's true yearnings. Olivia's attraction to Cesario begs the question—does the guise of masculinity alone hold her affections, or does her heart, unbidden, lean toward the feminine? Yet, Shakespeare’s hand seems not to craft a woman of such disposition, but rather to mirror the folly of an age that weighed worth by the sheen of outward appearance. Her swift shift of affection to Sebastian, and the embracing of Viola as kin, speaks to a capricious heart swayed more by visage than by essence: “A sister, you are she.” The play, then, is a mirror held to the human soul, reflecting both the folly and the truth that dwell within.",
            "The German colonial endeavor, in its breadth and reach, wore the visage of a harsh and unforgiving master, its infamy sealed in the annals of history through the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was once German South West Africa. Yet to cast such a sprawling enterprise under one shadow is to overlook its disparate nature. Like the lands it claimed, the empire was a patchwork of varied policies and governance. In education, too, it was a mosaic, with each colony telling its own story. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, or Tanganyika as it was known in the year of our Lord 1919, they uncovered a realm where the tongues of the people were not foreign to learning. The Germans had left their mark, a legacy of literacy that did not go unnoticed, even in places like Kamerun where their efforts drew nods of approval from those who came after.\n\nBut in the sun-baked expanse of South West Africa, now Namibia, the tale took a different turn. Here, unlike the schools that rose in East Africa, education of the native sons and daughters was a duty laid upon the mission houses, starved of any substantial succor from the state. The government, though, did not shirk when it came to the European settlers, investing heavily in their instruction, laying down state schools and fortifying the mission schools with funds and regulations of their own devising. These choices, these paths chosen, cast long shadows across the land, shadows that lingered long after the Germans themselves had passed from sovereignty. Where elsewhere in the empire the children grew to read and write, here in South West Africa, they remained largely untouched by the light of literacy, left in the dark by a confluence of forces both seen and unseen.\n\nThis discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to delve into the motives and attitudes that shaped this divergence, drawing upon the labors of those who have documented the German educational odyssey. Much of this lore lies buried in the tongue of the Germans, penned in the days when the empire itself was a living breath. These early tomes served as chronicles of the educational landscape, while later works in the English tongue sought to compare and contrast the schooling of one colony to another, teasing out the strands that wove their distinct tapestries. Foremost among these is Cohen’s treatise on the educational paths of South West Africa and East Africa, a study that lays bare the contrasts and seeks the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers, a throng of them in South West Africa, as a key to understanding why its schools were as they were.\n\nIn the eyes of the Germans, South West Africa was a land tempered by climate, more forgiving than others, though much of it lay under the dominion of the relentless desert. By the year 1913, nearly fifteen thousand souls of European descent called it home, far outnumbering those in East Africa, the next haven for settlers, where their numbers did not exceed 5,336. Here in this land, they sought to carve out a new life, and in doing so, shaped the fate of the land’s education in their image.",
            "In the annals of time, the United States of America and Mexico stand as testament to two lands once locked in a rivalry that stretched over the better part of six decades, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the closing years of the century in 1893. The zenith of this discord found its cruel expression in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with fire and iron, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the vast expanses of the American Southwest. This was not the only clash. No, many skirmishes marked the years between them, their fervor only beginning to wane as the world edged toward the abyss of the First World War. The seeds of this enmity were sown in the fertile ground of conflicting beliefs and traditions, the very marrow of their peoples, and the material desires that often set men at odds with one another.\n\nIt is not a tale untold by history, this notion of neighbors bound by geography yet divided by their ambitions. Borders, drawn by the hand of man, often serve as lines of conflict as much as they do lines of demarcation. And so it was with the United States and Mexico, mirroring rivalries seen elsewhere in the world. David M. Pletcher, in his reflections, spoke of the enduring nature of American diplomatic quandaries, finding them most acutely in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These lands, while close in miles, have oft been distant in harmony, their relations with the United States a stark contrast to the relative peace found further down the Latin American expanse.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, drove a wedge between these nations. Sally Frahm observed how the Americans, in the twilight of the eighteenth and the dawn of the nineteenth centuries, stood opposed to the specters of Catholicism and monarchy, much as they later would to fascism and communism. The ideological battleground was not one of governance but of belief, a heritage of distrust passed down from English and Spanish forebears, a legacy that shadowed the possibilities of friendship across the border.\n\nThe scholars Diehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes that punctuated the era of rivalry, more than mere footnotes in history's ledger. The bulk of these were struggles over land and borders, where raiders and bandits moved like whispers in the night across the vast deserts and plains, until the firm hand of military might from both nations brought some semblance of order to the chaos. As time drew on, Schmitt tells us, Mexico found itself in a position of reliance upon its northern neighbor, and the embers of territorial ambition cooled, giving way to the new fires of economic entanglement as the century waned.",
            "It was some fifteen years past when the world shifted beneath my feet, a sudden lurch into darkness by way of an illness I had never heard a whisper of. I was a nurse back then. The path I chose, not for love of it, but for the promise of surety and sanctuary denied to me in the rough years of youth. A mantra, it was, echoing through the halls of my coming of age—work you’ll find, for folk will always ail and need tending. So, though dreams tugged at the corners of my heart to be a scientist, a journalist, perhaps both, I set my course in nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood, forty-six years gone, solitary, with a bank barren as the desert and hands bound from the work that had defined me. Disabled, they called it, and on fifteen years of the dole from Social Security, I found myself stripped bare of all that could be claimed as mine. I scrape by, yet each day is a skirmish, a siege upon my dwindling sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty became a ghost, but one truth remained steadfast: without kin and the few souls who call themselves friends, I would not have weathered the long years. Strength, they say, is what you need when calamity strikes, but strength is a fickle companion in the storm.\n\nEmergencies, they come as they will—great and small, like the tide. No guarantee in this life, and for all the preparedness one might muster, some things rise too vast to be bested alone.\n\nIn the land of the free, we must cease placing our trust in the rotted basket of government. The decay is plain to see. Yet I yearn for a time when Americans might once more place faith in one another—learn anew the arts of giving and receiving aid rather than each scurrying to fashion bunkers in the yard.\n\nThose who raise the banner of rugged individualism speak of the past's glories. But truth be told, it was not the solitary grit that saw our forebears through the trials. It was the kindness, the respect shared among them, and the pooling of what was had. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in their trains of wagons reached the far coast not by solitude but by the strength of the many.\n\nSo, ready yourself, by all means. I have done the same. A kit of disasters with supplies for first aid, tablets to cleanse water, and sheets of plastic with tape for sealing against horrors unseen. I own flashlights aplenty, batteries in abundance, candles that will burn, and matches that will strike even in the rain, with canned goods to stave off hunger. Should you possess land and means to farm, to preserve, do so. A wood stove is a comfort, provided you're not hemmed in an apartment block.\n\nBut as you prepare, seek out your neighbors.",
            "In a time long shrouded in the fog of centuries past, there came into this world a prince whose destiny would shape the tides of human thought. Born into the opulence of a royal life, he would turn his back on it all to wander the ascetic path and find enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree. Known to the world as the Buddha, his teachings would lay the foundation for a faith that would span the ages, known in its most orthodox form as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient creed, now standing on the cusp of two and a half millennia, wears a visage altered by the passage of time. In lands like Sri Lanka, loyal to the Theravada tradition, rituals unfold that the Buddha himself never envisioned. The water-cutting ceremony, an annual rite, draws both the devout and the restless, infusing it with a sanctity unspoken in the earliest teachings. The faith, in its journey through time, has seen its skin and soul reshaped by forces both within and without, benevolent and antagonistic.\n\nWe must speak of forces that shape and reshape. Internal forces arise from within, born of the followers of the Buddhasasana, be they clad in the saffron robes of the monk or the simple garb of the layman. External forces, those that loom from outside the faith, come from the hands and minds of non-believers. Hostile forces seek to rend and ravage, born of spite or misunderstanding. Yet there are also benign forces, indifferent as a passing wind, which may sway the course with neither malice nor aid intended. Such terms will become familiar as this tale unfolds.\n\nTo begin with the essence, we must delve into the heart of what is believed. Buddhists find their sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma speaks through the ancient Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the very bones of metaphysical thought. Concepts like Anatta, the absence of a soul, Dukkha, the suffering woven into existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all, form the very breath of this doctrine. Only by grasping these truths can one break the relentless wheel of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. In its wake, desires, hatred, and delusions—all shall be extinguished in the light of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the rules for life: five precepts for the common folk and a myriad more for the monastics. At the core lie the four noble truths—life is suffering, attachment breeds suffering, and suffering can be vanquished. Such is the path laid bare for those who seek."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vastness of the world, culture stands as an unseen hand shaping the course of human discourse. It is a thing as elusive as the shadows cast by the waning sun, defined as much by absence as by presence, a mosaic of what it is and what it is not. A singular entity it is not, nor does it adhere to uniformity. The utterance that all Russians possess a stubborn resolve or that all Japanese yield with grace is a simplification too broad to hold weight. To know the broad strokes of a culture is but a beginning; the true task lies in discerning the depths of its influence upon the parley, understanding how its ethos will steer the dialogue at the table. The foreign culture is approached not in isolation but through the lens of one’s own, where comparisons burgeon unbidden.\n\nTo fathom the heart of another culture or the mind that it births requires a journey through its history, an acknowledgment of its biases. Not to judge nor to alter, but to accept it as it stands, to navigate within its confines, especially when one’s own standing is frail. On foreign soil, respect for the customs and credos of the land can bridge the chasm of cultural divides, propelling the negotiation onward.\n\nCulture is not bound by the borders of nations alone. Within each land, companies forge their own ethos. A corporate culture might demand the candle burn at both ends or may instead embrace a gentler rhythm. It reveals itself in the fabric of attire, in words spoken plain or wrapped in nuance, in the delegation of tasks. Where some companies nurture the spirit of giving in all its forms, others channel it through narrow avenues. The tapestry of American corporate culture alone, woven with threads of diversity from city to suburb, speaks to the multitude of thought within a single society. In lands where culture appears more monolithic, the surface is but a veil to be lifted.\n\nValues, those silent sentinels, hold the key to understanding the why of a culture. Where face and harmony are prized, a negotiator will not cast shame upon his kin to claim victory. Conversely, one from a land that esteems the fierce bargain will not hasten to settle. Such truths must be grasped before one takes a seat at the table. Yet, wisdom lies in the knowing of one’s adversary not just by creed but by character, for it is this knowledge that renders negotiation true.",
            "In the quietude of the soul, the fool whispers to himself a denial of the divine, and so it is written in Psalm 14. This ancient utterance finds its echo in the words of St. Anselm, who in his musings on the Almighty lays bare a path of faith-bound understanding. Alongside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, each of them defenders of the same celestial truth. Our task is to weigh their words, to discern which among them speaks with greater clarity. To this end, we must first acknowledge their shared conviction in the existence of the Biblical God, for to entertain any other deity would render their arguments as ships adrift without an anchor.\n\nLet us look upon Anselm, who beckons us inward to find that God dwells not in distant heavens but within the confines of our own reckoning. In his view, the mind itself bears witness to a divine presence that defies the very notion of nonexistence. Though his prose may wander through thickets of complexity, the heart of his claim is that within the human soul lies the testament of God's existence, needing no external corroboration. It is a faith unadorned by empirical trappings, a quiet assurance that resounds within the chambers of belief.\n\nTurn now to Aquinas, whose gaze extends beyond the self to the world that surrounds. His is a philosophy built upon reason's bedrock, where God's presence is woven into the very fabric of reality. Through five pillars of logic—change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony—he constructs a scaffold upon which the divine rests. Each argument is a strand in the tapestry of necessity, a declaration that the absence of God leaves the puzzle of existence incomplete. It is a doctrine that seeks to convert through the power of intellect, offering a vision of belief that stands unshaken by doubt.\n\nIn the end, both men offer their truths, each a mirror reflecting the divine in its own light. Yet, neither can wholly encompass the vastness of faith, for the divine is a mystery that eludes even the most earnest of seekers.",
            "In the telling of tales, writers weave their incantations, crafting the world that pulses with life or death upon the page. There are those who wield language like a painter his brush, casting hues of feeling and thought across the canvas of the mind. F. Scott Fitzgerald is such an artist, and in his opus, The Great Gatsby, he conjures images that linger like the scent of rain on a parched earth. He pairs words that seem at odds, yet in their union they call forth an aura that settles upon the reader like dust on a forgotten mantelpiece. With symbols, he does the same, breathing life into them until they thrum with meaning.\n\nFitzgerald paints with colors—gold, green, white and gray, red and pink—each stroke deliberate, each hue a whisper of what lies beneath. In The Great Gatsby, these colors are given weight, white and gray especially, imbued with a sense of sameness, a whisper of what has been and what may never be again. White stands a bit apart, a reflection of the higher echelons, while gray speaks of age and the slow fade into obscurity. From the novel’s onset, these shades pervade, cloaking characters in a veneer of societal expectation. Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white, drift through the pages like specters of privilege. Nick attends Gatsby's gathering in white flannels, Tom in a white shirt, and Catherine powdered milky white as if to suggest a purity that life has long since sullied.\n\nYet, when the world shifts to Gatsby’s revelries, color breaks the monotony, vibrant and unrestrained. The commonplace becomes white and gray, as Nick traverses the white chasms of New York, as the names of the partygoers fade to gray upon his list. Catherine's abode, a slice of white among the uniformity, a testament to the sameness of existence. Common folk and forgotten places are cast in these shades—Jordan and Daisy in their white girlhood, the gray cars, the gray land, the Italian child and the gray old man, all swallowed by the valley of ashes.\n\nAnd with this weight of meaning, Fitzgerald turns to Daisy once more. She emerges from the narrative clothed in white, a spectral presence in a white roadster, less a woman and more a mirage of what Gatsby covets. She drifts through the haze of gray fur, once more donned in white as the storm brews between Tom and Gatsby, a symbol of the unattainable, the uniform, the dream that never was.",
            "In the lands of San Diego County, where the sun holds dominion over the sky and the earth yields its bounty with quiet grace, there lies a realm of agriculture both vast and varied. The soil, warmed by the gentle hand of a mild climate, brings forth a harvest of tomatoes and citrus, of leafy greens that sway in the breeze like ocean kelp, of squash and broccoli, herbs that speak of ancient remedies, and tree fruits as sweet as they are scarce. Peaches hang heavy on the boughs alongside lemons, berries grow in wild profusion, and peppers lend their fire to the fields. Here, in this fertile expanse, the notion of organic community-supported agriculture takes root, burgeoning in popularity with such fervor that the waiting lists of local growers stretch long and winding like the roads that cross these lands. The call for organic eggs and milk echoes across the valleys, answered by farms that open their gates to those who seek more than sustenance—a glimpse into the workings of the earth, a walk among the rows where birds sing and the land breathes.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming is not without its trials, for it demands a labor as relentless as the sun's passage across the sky. The hands that tend these fields must do so with care, forgoing the ease of chemicals to nurture the soil, to guard against pests and weeds with the vigilance of a watchman in the night. Yet in these efforts lies a reward beyond profit—a biodiversity that flourishes in the absence of man's poisons, a harmony of plant and creature that thrives on the land's own terms. The small farmer, lacking the vast machinery of large-scale operations, must turn to wisdom and will to balance the ledger of nature and commerce. And so they may seek the counsel of those who have walked this path before, those who know the ways of cover crops and grazing rotation, who understand that to manage a landscape is to sculpt a living tapestry of life.\n\nIn this story of land and labor, we find a parcel near the town of Potrero, nestled against the Cleveland National Forest in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. One hundred and sixty acres of chaparral and nonnative grassland, where oak woodlands stand sentinel, where the East County Southern Foothills stretch under the aegis of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The voices of a hundred species echo here, some on the brink of silence—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that flutter on the edge of memory, the California gnatcatcher singing a song of survival. The land remembers its past, the tread of Native Americans who knew its secrets, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers who came in the late 1800s, staking claims and leaving their mark.\n\nIn the quest to understand what might be achieved upon this land, I sought the wisdom of a real estate listing, the promise of government programs that whisper of assistance to those who would take up the mantle of small-scale farming. And as a beacon of possibility, I found an organic farm in this very region—a testament to the resilience of those who work the land, who strive to make a life that is both bountiful and kind to the world they inhabit.",
            "There exists a bond between brothers, a tether unyielding and eternal. Within its confines stir emotions as old as Cain and Abel, love and pride intermingled with jealousy and cruelty, a volatile brew. Brothers see each other with a clarity denied to others, a reflection of themselves cast in the eyes of their kin. It is in moments of desperation that this bond reveals its true nature, be it for salvation or destruction, and the cost of such revelations is steep. To comprehend the emotions born of this brotherhood is to reckon with the consequences they summon. When a brother gazes into the eyes of another and sees there his own likeness, he beholds not the visage presented to the world but his own unvarnished truth. In the deeds done and the repercussions thereof lies the essence of their character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" such a bond is tested, the tempest of emotions that accompany it laid bare. Against a backdrop of vibrant, pulsating life, the two brothers embark on a journey doomed to futility. Pride and disappointment wage war in a scene that leaves only one brother standing. Through the stark depiction of Doodle, the protagonist, and the charged exchanges between them, as well as the narrator’s lens, the tangled emotions of the protagonist and his perception of his world are revealed, shaping his every act.\n\nPride is the lodestar of the protagonist's actions. From the first ventures with his fragile brother Doodle to their final, fateful outing, resentment simmers within him. He longed for a brother he could mold, to teach the arts of breath-holding, running, and climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a perch-mate in the great pine behind the barn. But these dreams, wild and unchecked, were dashed by Doodle's frailty, his heart so weak it was a wonder he lived at all, let alone could partake in such exertions. What a cruel blow to the young dreamer, his fantasies shattered like brittle glass. Even so, anger festers, the thought of smothering the child a dark shadow in his mind. Yet a mere smile from the little one melts his resolve, a simple gesture that reignites hope. It reveals a love for his brother that, though buried, was always there, an instinctual bond that defied even his darkest musings.",
            "The human brain stands as a labyrinthine testament to the mysteries of the cosmos, a vessel of infinite creativity and ceaseless computation. In the march of time, as humankind trudged forth from the shadows of its primitive dawn to the glaring brightness of modernity, so too did the symbols we forged to grasp the ineffable nature of our own minds evolve. Once likened to a waxen slate, then to the delicate parchment of a papyrus scroll, and further still to the silent pages of a book, our most recent metaphor casts the brain in the cold, mechanical light of a computer. Yet, as you wade through the murky waters of neural knowledge, be wary of these metaphors, for they are but crude instruments and may lead you astray.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the whisper of the world upon our flesh, the touch of heat, the song of sound waves, the silent cascade of light's photons, all transmuted into the electrochemical symphony within our skulls. The sensory tale unfurls, crafted by the brain's alchemy through the dual pathways of creation: the bottom-up and the top-down. When your eyes fall upon the stark image of a black box adrift on a white sea, the bottom-up journey stitches together the threads of color and form, the abrupt borders where the dark meets the light, declaring the presence of a box. Meanwhile, the top-down current rides upon the bottom-up decisions, hastening recognition until the box stands revealed, not as some void but as the solid black presence it truly is.\n\nJust as the story is told, so too must it be weighed. An unseen hand within the mind sifts through the sensory harvest, discerning the vital from the trivial, deciding what shall pass through the gates of cognition. Though the blades of grass beneath your feet escape your notice, each one processed yet none remembered, the whisper of your name in a cacophonous room rises above the din. Thus, the mind's journey is one of stages, where attention is the tide that shapes the land.\n\nTo unravel the tale, the brain must first engrave its runes upon the tablets of memory. Memory is manifold, from the fleeting traces of the sensory to the ephemeral grasp of the working, and the deep wells of the long-term. The act of encoding is the first rite, each sense its own language—a word seen, a word heard, a word understood. Once inscribed, the memory must endure. In some creatures, the memory of the moment lingers in a loop of electricity through the neurons, a brief echo held for mere seconds. The long tales of the past, it is said, reside in the very architecture of proteins, their structures the silent keepers of our history.\n\nThe maps of knowledge are drawn in many ways, some sketched from the whims of human recollection, others from the cold logic of machines, and still others from the silent whispers of the neurons themselves. The semantic network model speaks of nodes, each a concept, bound by threads of meaning—\"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" a web unending. In this maze of thought, the mind wanders, forever seeking, forever finding.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States found itself ensnared in the grip of a financial cataclysm most dire. The specter of unemployment rose like a dark tide, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the towering giants of American enterprise lay broken and scattered across the economic wasteland. This relentless recession holds its sway even now, and so we are compelled to ask: by what means did this calamity come to pass, and what salve might yet mend it? In essence, this crisis was borne of reckless and shortsighted machinations within the political sphere, a folly that goaded banks and businesses alike into the reckless issuance of sub-prime loans, thrust upon a fragile and unripe financial edifice. Meanwhile, those behemoths of mortgage, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were coerced to underwrite and repackage these ill-fated loans into CDOs and CDSs. When the debtors defaulted, the banks found themselves bereft of the capital reserves needed to stem the tide, and the chaos was thus visited upon the repackaged mortgages they had sold, seeping inexorably into the wider economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster trace back to 1999, within the tenure of President Clinton, who sought to extend his grasp upon the office by currying favor with the populace. To this end, his administration loosened the strictures of lending, planting the seeds of ruin that would bloom into the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes, with a prescient eye, foresaw the storm on the horizon: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As has been laid bare, and as Holmes did portend, such reckless lending practices were destined to unravel the economic tapestry.\n\nA confluence of forces conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, not least of which was the convoluted architecture of mortgages themselves. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding ever more sectors of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This interlocking of fortunes led households across the nation, and financial markets alike, to overextend their reach, leaving them exposed like raw nerves to the slightest tremor in price.\n\nThe housing bubble did indeed burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes upon these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great titans of investment banking in the U.S. together found themselves burdened with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was rent asunder, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the chains of commercial banks, subject to the stern hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were consigned to the aegis of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vast and barren land where the would-be scribe unfurls their wings and takes to the heavens, dazzling those below with prose that enchants as much as it ensnares. Or perhaps it is the barren field where the reader's eyes grow heavy and their fingers itch to turn back, muttering curses beneath their breath. Dr. Merlin oft finds herself railing at the glowing screen, caught in the snare of an excess of words that fail to delight, neither in the mundane nor the grand.\n\nExposition, that siren, is no friend to the storyteller.\n\nThe wise among you know well the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still Dr. Merlin finds herself lost in the weeds of text where naught occurs, or perhaps too much. Exposition is the devil perched upon your shoulder, whispering that the past must be laid bare before the tale can truly begin, a different voice than the one urging the laying bare of all trivial details from the characters' youthful days.\n\nExposition serves to lay down what has transpired, often in plain speech. In cinema, it comes to pass when one soul unburdens a torrent of knowledge upon another, as in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the world of fiction, it is the author who does the telling.\n\nAn illustration may serve. As you traverse through a tale, you learn that the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain hour, that they wed in grand celebration, and that he was taken from her in sudden violence. You would not foresee this unfolding in the span of two pages, with both uttering but a pair of lines apiece. You would hope the author lingers upon the husband, revealing his affections through speech and bearing, and likewise that the heroine's devotion is laid bare through acts both large and small, showing how his presence wove richness into her life. Such a telling would draw you into the husband’s fate and open a window into the heroine's soul, revealing what she saw in him, the depth of their union, casting light upon her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes. You would share in her mourning, and in doing so, find yourself bound more tightly to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you seek substance upon the skeletal frame of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the architect of this tale, it falls to you to add this substance. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet continues undeterred*) The urge may arise to hasten past the mundane. You may sketch a new character, noting he once flew with the Air Force, now stands guard over a gas station by night, twice wed with no progeny, spending his Saturdays with rod and reel, harboring a quiet dream of one day owning the station, having broken his fast with Eggs Benedict.\n\nIt is this richness, this depth, that you must provide.",
            "In the dim morning light of August, the world unfolded through the flickering screen of a television set in Columbus, Ohio. NBC 4's broadcast carried the weight of tragedy and the stark truth of human frailty. A man named Shad Hostettler, his name a dark whisper on the lips of the anchor, had taken a blade to his wife's flesh, her name lost to the silence of the airwaves. His image, a visage of malevolence, stared back from the screen. The tale told swiftly, a mere breath in the life of the broadcast, yet the shadows of the act lingered long after the story moved on.\n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, a youth of eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in the Sharon Woods night, a bullet lodged in his flesh, his story still untold by the voice of justice. The SWAT team prowled the aftermath, yet no specters of guilt had been seized. The words came and went like a whisper, the brevity of it a wound in itself, a testament to the ghostly indifference that shrouds the suffering of those whose skin bears the hue of the earth.\n\nAnd then the whirring of blades overhead, a Med-Flight helicopter scarred by a bullet's bite, the trajectory traced back to a rifle's .22 caliber breath. A bounty of five thousand dollars lay on the table for any who might guide the hand of justice to the shooter’s door.\n\nThe sky's fury was foretold next, rain and thunder gathering on the horizon, the weather a fleeting specter in the tapestry of the news, a siren's call to keep the watchers tethered to the glow of the screen.\n\nA robbery then, on Clime Road, the shadow of a man cloaked in a hoodie, his skin dark as the night, the words lingered on his description, the color of his skin spoken of as though it held the weight of the crime itself. \n\nLastly, Rene Rodriguez, a name heavy with the sins of a drug kingpin, sentenced for his deeds, the term stretched into 300 months, the length of it a curious choice, perhaps meant to echo louder in the hearts of men. His identity as Hispanic mentioned, a detail like a stray thread in a woven tale. \n\nAnd so the stories wove together, a tapestry of human folly and fate, each a chapter in the endless book of the world.",
            "An exchange traded fund, the ETF, is a security that bears the weight of an index or perhaps some commodity or a basket of assets fashioned in the likeness of an index fund yet with the supple nature of a stock that wanders the exchange. It offers the breadth of an index fund and the singularity of stock ownership with the curious ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to hold but one share in a single transaction. Its allure is plain and the expense ratios of ETFs lie beneath those of the mutual fund by a long measure. Yet there are shadows, the commission exacted upon each trade like the toll of a stock order. Still, the diversity of funds is wide as the horizon. Though benefits are laid bare, the wary investor will weigh them, question their breadth and depth. In this pursuit, we turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, laying it beside the top ten holdings that make its body and soul, to discern if the single ETF matches the tapestry of owning a varied ten, and whether there is a finer weave of the same stocks that may yield a sharper return.\n\nTo navigate the labyrinth of the ETF, we focus on the ten holdings that bear 63.58% of its essence. These ten, they stand below, each a fraction of the greater whole.\n\nTo see how these ten speak for the ETF IHF, we take their share of assets and stretch them to fill the hundred, calculating their Beta and Return as if this was the whole of the portfolio, weighted as the ETF has cast them. The figures, they are laid in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain as day that a portfolio of these ten holdings shines with a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% rise in its trail. Its Beta, too, lies .12 beneath the ETF's own mark. It seems this portfolio of ten might offer richer harvests with softer winds. But it is the truth of numbers that the mean of these paths might not diverge as much as they whisper.\n\nTo gauge the difference in these paths, the standard deviation of each stock in the ten is found, stretched to the hundred to compare its sum against the ETF IHF's own sway.",
            "In the cold starkness of Figure 17, one sees a steep decline in the commuter log entries as the third month of the project unfurls its tale. It is a narrative marked by disappointment, an enigma of sorts, and the reasons for it remain shrouded in the shadows of speculation. Winter arrives with an iron grip upon the New England campus, and the numbers of those brave souls venturing forth by bicycle or on foot dwindle in its wake. December makes its entrance, heralding the close of the fall semester, a time where minds are consumed by exams and grades and the myriad tasks that conclude the academic cycle. It is no wonder then that the commuter log, a mere whisper amidst the din, fades from consciousness.\n\nThe holiday season descends, a harbinger of respite, a month-long exile from the duties of academia for students and faculty alike. The campus lies bare, and in its emptiness, the logs dwindle further. As January's end signals a return to scholarly pursuits, the logs remain sparse, February offering little hope of revival. Perhaps it is the nature of such ventures, a bright flare at their inception, only to wane with time. In March, in a bid to rekindle the flame, the Carpool Challenge Week is born, a blitz of effort to breathe life once more into the endeavor. Log submissions rise, a testament to the campaign's success.\n\nYet, the struggle to sustain the momentum of the project is a relentless foe, compounded by the rhythms of holiday and semester breaks that define the world of higher learning. Another adversary lies in the hearts of men and women, a deep-seated love of the freedom and independence found behind the wheel of their own cars. It is a cultural tenet, a truth not easily swayed. To entice the masses towards alternative paths, incentives must be laid out like treasures. Gift certificates to local haunts, restaurants, coffee shops, and beyond were offered, their allure undeniable. Yet, one wonders what might have been wrought by grander prizes—a bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car—vehicles of change that could alter the course of engagement.\n\nThroughout, the nature of the prizes remained a constant, unchanging as the seasons. But what if the stakes had risen? If in December bicycles had been announced, and by the time January arrived, hints of hybrid or electric cars danced before the eyes of the participants? One can only ponder how the numbers might have swelled, how the engagement might have transformed from decline to resurgence. The promise of such rewards might have held the key to a different tale.",
            "In the archives of the Library of Congress lies a collection of early Edison films, wherein I found myself drawn to the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films are a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the cleverness of editing. My study delved into the poetics that pervade the majority of these films, while also casting an eye toward those few that stand as evolutionary outliers. At the dawn of the century, the trick film remained tethered to its stagebound roots, framed by a frontal proscenium, absent of camera movement, comprised of long and medium shots, adhering to the principle of one shot equating to one film. Yet, as the century turned, there emerged films that dared to defy these conventions, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films together is their steadfast reliance on the interior set within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera, resolute in its position, refuses to pursue figures or objects beyond its fixed gaze. This composition harks back to the theatre, to vaudeville, and to magic acts, where the stage is both a boundary and a canvas. The constraint of the stage renders the movement of figures in trick films to a horizontal plane, a dance from side to side, never venturing towards or away from the camera. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel from the year 1900. The actors enter from the right, traversing back and forth, yet the camera remains unmoved, indifferent to their absence when they slip beyond its frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip ensures that shots are predominantly long, occasionally medium, but never close. The theatre and vaudeville influence persists, where the audience bears witness to the entirety of the performance, framed by the stage's borders. In these early films, actors remain anchored to the middle ground, eschewing the intimacy of close-ups.\n\nIn the nascent days of cinema, trick films followed a simple creed: one conceptual shot equals a film. This confines most to a fleeting minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. It also curtails the dramatic or narrative ambitions, focusing instead on brief vaudevillian tricks—acts of magic, disappearance, and transformation, stories left untold. Yet, in the realm of trick films, one must remember that one conceptual shot does not always equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may be a seamless tapestry of fragments, conjuring the illusion of appearing or vanishing. Observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895. A closer look betrays the moment where Mary's severed \"head\" graces the screen, though to the viewer, the film remains a singular shot.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, the Gothic Novel stands as a curious beacon, an oxymoron of old and new as Ian Watt might say in his chronicling of such tales. This mode, both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness yet celebrated for its terrible sublimity, finds its origins in Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto. Here, ancient and modern are woven together to birth a new form, a Gothic Story as Walpole christened it, a tapestry of old theatrics and the mimicry of the natural world as seen through the eyes of modern literary minds. The Gothic, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, dances in the archaic light of its own making, a relic unsophisticated in the face of modernity’s march. Yet, it is this very duality, the theatrical Gothic entwined with the intimacy of the novel’s form, that grants it longevity, a relic both obsolete and reborn for readers adrift in time.\n\nAmongst the echoes of its pages, chivalry rises as a specter, a vestige of medieval knighthood both preserved and reshaped in Walpole’s creation. The Gothic writers, drawn to this ideal of bravery and honor, saw in the chivalric past a mirror held to their own disenchanted world. The Gothic past becomes a canvas for idealization, a precursor to the Romantic that sought to mend the present's ills. Walpole, writing amidst political unrest, saw the chivalric virtues as a balm for society’s wounds, a lost morality in the din of the present. This yearning is etched in characters like Frederic, a figure painted with strokes of chivalric imagery—a prince, a sufferer of tragedies, a presumed casualty of infidels. In Frederic, the gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated echo, a portent of the Gothic’s embrace of excess, a myth made flesh within the pages of Otranto.\n\nThus, in the Gothic Novel, we find an edifice built from the stones of the past, a shadowed testament to the old and the new, a bridge to the realms of what was and what might yet be.",
            "In the vast and unyielding landscape of commerce, there exists a journey that is neither seen nor heard, yet it moves the world. It is the procession of goods and dreams, from the whispered wants of the customer to the raw earth, through the alchemy of creation and the endless march to the waiting hands of the buyer. This is the domain of supply chain management, a name coined by the prophet Keith Oliver in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two. In his vision, he saw the whole of it, the grand orchestration of planning and action, a dance to satisfy the unceasing hunger of the market. There are six pillars upon which this edifice is built: the birth of goods, their provision, their hoarding, their place, their passage, and the knowledge that binds them. On these the manager must lean, to craft a service that speaks to the heart of the customer.\n\nFirst among these is production, the genesis. It is the bedrock upon which all else rests. Here the when and the why, the where and the how are carved into the stone of intention. The steward of this stage must read the stars, the market, to divine the desires of the people. In this knowing, they chart the course of what shall be made and in what measure. Once the prophecy is clear, they choose the place of creation, the forge best suited to the task. And in this choosing, they heed the twin gods of demand and satisfaction. Then comes the reckoning of labor and the tending of machines, a schedule drawn from the marrow of necessity. Every thread in this tapestry is vital, for a single flaw may unravel the whole. I have walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where every thread is woven with care, each process a solemn rite. Such is the power of design, a beacon against the chaos of uncertainty.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, is the lifeblood of this endeavor. It is the calculus of strategy, the decisions that shape the bones of a facility and the alliances formed in the crucible of need. A single product may arise from many hands, each division a realm unto itself, with its own tools and toils. The master of this stage must discern which hand best suits each task. At times, the call goes beyond, to other lands, to the altars of outsourcing. For in this, there is velocity, the sacred triad of quality, flexibility, and the eternal quest for a cost that does not bleed the coffers dry. Such is the dance of supply, a testament to the will of those who shape the world unseen.",
            "In the shadow of that bygone era, the novels of the Victorian age stand tall, their pages woven with threads of meticulous detail, their narratives steeped in the lives of the highborn. Yet, there are those tales that wander from this well-trodden path, among them Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, where the air of mystery hangs thick and the peculiar dances in the periphery of the ordinary. Such elements breathe life into the souls of their characters, peeling back layers to reveal the tumult beneath, the hidden urges and the ghosts of their desires.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, ... he found that he was talking to them.... Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the shroud of mystery often descends through dreams or states akin to dreams, their nature shifting with the winds of the narrative. In the story of Oliver Twist, such visions uncover hidden truths about the boy, the shadows that haunt him, and the grim reality that encircles him. When the memory of the shooting is stirred in chapter 28, it unfurls in Oliver's mind like a fevered dream, a cruel reminder of his helplessness and the ravages upon his frail form. The phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunt his thoughts, his senses dulled, oblivious to the unseen hand that sweeps him away. Pain has become his constant companion, a specter intertwined with fear rather than surprise. With his will subsumed, questions arise about the hand that steers his fate, a destiny not of his own making. The shooting stands as testament to Oliver's lack of agency, his inability to grasp the reins of his own survival, even as the specter of death looms. A shadow of surrender creeps into his heart, as if old Fagin's grip tightens, bending him to despair's will, stifling the fire within him that might otherwise rise in defiance.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Years passed since I found myself in the quiet corridors of an after-school program where I took to tutoring young souls not much taller than the desks they sat at. I did what I could to guide them through the tangled thickets of subjects they found troublesome, though my own compass pointed truest toward the realms of English and reading. There was a teacher there, an instructor, who beckoned me to aid a young boy named Adrian. He was a small thing, perhaps third or fourth grade, and he wrestled with words as if they were phantoms. It struck me strange how some letters he knew with certainty, and others he could not fathom, like strangers in a familiar town. The boy was of Latino descent, that much was clear, yet his English was unblemished, flawless in speech if not in script. We toiled in that place, him and I, until the day his mother came to the school. \n\nI remember it well. I was tending to a few children who had not gone on some excursion with their fellows when she appeared. She spoke to me in Spanish, and though my grasp of that language was tenuous, we managed to bridge the gulf between us with the few words I did possess. It was in that moment, as if struck by an epiphany, I realized Adrian's struggle was no enigma of reading, but of familiarity with the English alphabet itself. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him in the years to come, I cannot say. Yet I wish him well and trust that the world treated him kindly.\n\nThis tale I recount is a mirror to the broader issue of language barriers that echo through the halls of California's schools. It is a reminder that these obstacles are not always what they seem. Even for those who speak English with grace, reading it can be an insurmountable wall. We know this problem lives among us, so what path do we take? For Adrian, the answer lay in patience and guidance through the letters and sounds of English. Yet for many others, this challenge is a labyrinth with no single thread to lead them out. There is no panacea. The solution lies in weaving together a tapestry of dual language programs, immersive classrooms, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nThe dual language approach is a seed of promise. It is not simply for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual education soar above their peers. Fear clings to this idea, whispers of wasted effort and benefit to none. But if these programs were the norm instead of the outlier, all children might drink deeply from their well. How do we realize this vision? Not by demanding every teacher bear the burden of bilingualism. Such an expectation is beyond reason. But there is no barrier to enlisting aides, tutors, call them what you will, who carry both languages within them like a gift.",
            "From the tender age when the world is new and unformed, there arises the notion of something vast and ungraspable, a specter of the infinite looming ever just beyond our ken. We are ushered into halls of worship, to Sunday schools or temples, or sent on inward journeys to seek the elusive truths that lie within. Many among us take the faith of our ancestors as our own, a mantle passed down through the ages. Yet others cast it aside, claiming the barren certainty of a world circumscribed by self. We may cling to one creed only to find it wanting and exchange it for another. Each path is a solitary pilgrimage into the recesses of our souls, a search for meaning amidst shadows, for the dawn beyond the night.\n\nIt was on the porch, the rain a steady cadence on the tin roof, that I asked my father his favored bird. \"A cardinal,\" he said, a word spoken into the twilight with the gravity of a man who knows the weight of things unsaid. We sat there, the smoke from our cigarettes mingling with the rain's mist, the gutters a torrent drowning the garden's edge. His gaze fixed upon the falling rain, a look that spoke of seeking and remembering both. Time had thinned him, his clothes now mere drapery over a wasted frame, his hair a sparse memory of what once was. He looked away, eyes averted, and silence fell between us, a chasm I could not cross. I felt the solitude of impending loss, the words lodged in my throat, words that would make the inevitable irrevocable. I reached out, drew my chair near, and together we watched the rain descend upon the June dusk.\n\nDecember came, and with it the final departure. Five days after I marked another year, my father slipped away. The treatments had been futile, a prolongation of pain that defied reason or mercy. I questioned the divine, wondered what god would allow such suffering, found no solace in the night. Prayers faltered on my lips, for if there was a god, he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing, the man who had given me life. I chose not to see the end, to remember him as he was, not as he became. I knew him better than those who surrounded his final hours, better than his kin, and I knew he would not wish his child to mark his end with eyes full of grief. So I withdrew, wrapped myself in solitude for three days, awaiting the inevitable word.\n\nThe silence was unbroken. No call came.",
            "In the fields of Caroline, where the soil lay thick with the sweat of men, John Taylor stood as a sentinel of Republicanism. His hands were those of an agriculturalist, the earth beneath his nails a testament to his craft, yet his voice rang loud in the halls of politics. A man forged in the fires of his convictions, dedicated to the cause of personal freedom and the governance that would safeguard it. The land was his gospel, and from it he drew the marrow of his beliefs, seeing in its tilling the very essence of sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the laws that bind men.\n\nTaylor gazed upon the young republic and saw a canvas unmarred by ancient rites. Here was a land unshackled, a place where self-government might take root in the rich, untrodden soil. He held fast to the natural rights of man, each right a thread in the tapestry, and if one were cut, the whole would unravel. Such rights must be held beyond the reach of government’s grasping hand. He spoke of the so-called \"state of nature,\" where brute strength and cunning ruled, a world that civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor called for a government that mirrored the duality of man's soul, both light and dark. His creed was simple: \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Good principles were those that guarded private property, nurtured the land, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. A government rooted in such principles would stand firm, its course unaltered by the winds of avarice and self-interest. These were the twin engines of man’s endeavor, yet only when they built upon the public good could they be redeemed. A vigilant government was the bulwark against man's inherent darkness, ever watchful lest it stray into shadow.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, held fast to the Constitution’s strict construction. He envisioned a Federal government bound by chains no looser than those spelled out in its sacred text. He knew the cost of a sprawling government, its greed a harbinger of tyranny. Yet he also feared the perils of a literal reading, divorced from the minds that first penned its words. To him, the Declaration of Independence was the true charter, a testament to a union of sovereign states, not a monolithic nation. In its words, he found the promise of a republic, a promise he held as dearly as the soil beneath his feet.",
            "I looked down into the abyss and the abyss looked back, a flat and unyielding gaze that offered no quarter nor demanded any. The mind, that treacherous vessel of reflection, churned not with thoughts but with the silent acceptance of what lay before it. There was a strange purity to the act, a consciousness unburdened by abstraction, the eyes filling and emptying in a rhythm as ancient as the earth itself. Such was the dance of perception, a fluid encounter with the world that left no trace of itself.\n\nOnce, under the guidance of a fellow creator, I took up a tome titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had harbored a desire to sketch since boyhood, and this book promised to illuminate the path from the mundane to the sublime, from the humble pencil to the mysteries of line and form. It spoke of a frame, a boundary to tame the chaos of sight, to isolate a simple truth in a world of complexity. Imagine, if you will, a bowl of fruit upon a table, a still life amidst the clutter of a kitchen, reduced to its essence by the artist's square.\n\nYet now, as I stood before the porcelain altar, I could not conjure that frame. The enormity of it all, a visceral presence that defied containment, left me rooted in awe. Artists have their phases; Picasso with his blues, Monet with his verdant dreams, and the Renaissance with its symphony of hues. If I were to claim any such vision, it would begin here, in this Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers brushed the tool of my creation, the muscles of my arm a conduit for the will of the mind, shaping the void in a moment that felt pure and unadulterated. The water moved, eddied in its crystalline repose, and the detritus of life surrendered to the flow. Again my hand found the handle, more insistent now, willing the recalcitrant mass to yield to its fate. But it clung stubbornly, a defiant creature in the depths.\n\nWith mop in hand, my stance firm, the tie at my neck a mark of the burden I bore, I cast a weary eye upon the refuse left behind by those who tread the aisles of Rite Aid. A few more attempts, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the roll at my side. Layers of paper ensconced my hand, an improvised gauntlet for the task ahead. Straightening, I bent once more, my hand descending into the water like a pilgrim reaching for the holy relic buried in the earth.",
            "In the waning light of the day, the shadows of the young stretch long across the tarmac and the hum of engines fills the air like some ancient call. They are out there, these teenagers, driving under a sky that holds no mercy, and it is here that they find themselves at the intersection of fate and folly. The National Institutes of Health speak of the unripe minds of these young drivers, their brains not yet carved for the perils of the road. Inexperience, that age-old specter, shadows their every mile, and it is this lack that leads them to calamity—vehicles overturned, the road beneath them slipping away, speed their constant companion.\n\nIn the company of their peers, the weight of wisdom seems to lift, leaving them unanchored, adrift on highways and backroads alike. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth with studies that draw a stark line between the age of passengers and the frequency of their misfortunes. And yet, in response, states like California erect flimsy barricades, provisional licenses that seek to hem in the chaos. But these are but reeds against the tide.\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the very essence of youth. These young drivers, by every account and measure, stand unready for the burden they bear. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman speaks of the wild heart beneath the breast of youth, suggesting that even at eighteen, the fire of risk still burns too bright. USA Today carries his words, a warning of the thrill-seeking urge that dances like a devil on the shoulder of the young. Delay the right to drive, he argues, until the flame subsides.\n\nShould we continue to set these young behind the wheel, their fates will remain entwined with ruin. By 2010, the progeny of the Baby Boomers shall flood the roadways, a generation poised to steer into the unknown. The reckoning of legislation, clear and stark, waits at the horizon. Schools may still guide the hands and minds of future drivers, yet the wheels should not turn for any under eighteen. A provisional path may lead them, requiring hours of practice beneath the watchful eye of an elder. Uniform laws, drawn with a steady hand across the nation, may yet guard the youth from their own undoing.\n\nSuch laws are not new, nor are they revolutionary. They stand instead as a testament to reason, a bulwark against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the vast expanse of human condition there lies a peculiar disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. The mind, that mysterious engine of perception, falters here. It is a disorder that speaks to the inefficiencies of the central nervous system, the way it stumbles over the auditory information that it is meant to decipher. The brain hears, yet does not understand, failing to separate the urgent whispers of words from the clamor of the world. Those who bear this burden hear as others do, yet the translation of sound into meaning is fraught and uncertain.\n\nIn the mid-century past, they spoke of auditory imperception, a term birthed in the studies of children whose communicative paths were obscured. Italian pioneers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, sought to unravel this enigma in 1954, and by 1961, a thinker named Kimura would introduce dichotic testing, a lens into the physiology of the central auditory nervous system. In '77, minds gathered in conference to stir this pool of understanding, to delve deeper into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD, in its many manifestations, is a shadowy adversary. The afflicted may find themselves adrift in sound, unable to pinpoint its source or discern its nature. The dance of acoustic events might confuse them; the subtle shifts in speech tones, the markers of sarcasm or sincerity, elude their grasp. Sounds can overlap like waves upon a shore, obscuring meaning. The sequence of auditory information, meant to guide, becomes a tangled skein.\n\nTo diagnose this disorder is no simple task, for the tools are many and the paths are unclear. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others peer into the depths of listening behaviors, seeking clarity. Yet, there is no singular test that holds the promise of certainty. The process involves observing responses to sound, discerning the nuances of auditory perception. The patient is presented with a cacophony, asked to make sense of it, to sift the signal from the noise. In some cases, the very echoes within the ear are measured, searching for that which might reveal the workings of the mind.\n\nThere remains no known cause for this disorder, no single path to diagnosis. It lingers in the shadows of understanding, a testament to the complexities of the human brain and the sounds that encompass it.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling to social work, I've set my sights on laboring with the Division of Family and Children Services. A path laid out to shield the young from harm and to offer solace to families adrift. Values I bring forth to this field are woven with service, respect, ethical fortitude, a relentless commitment to mend the bonds between souls, and a ceaseless quest for my own betterment in this craft. These values, they are not mere words for social workers to wield; they are the very marrow of my being.\n\nAlways have I yearned to lend a hand to others, yet the road remained shrouded in uncertainty. Through the corridors of high school and the lecture halls of college, I watched as many turned their backs on their demons, cloaked in denial, while some clung to frail crutches of their own making. Bearing witness to such tales, I steered toward a degree in Psychology. But when the ink was dry on my diploma from Piedmont College, the path was still veiled, so I paused. That summer, in the company of a friend, I met a boy of sixteen, perched anxious upon a couch. His tale was one of escape from the talons of abuse. The next dawn, he spoke to the law of the shadows in his own home. I found myself standing at the threshold of that house, voicing my concerns to the officers, a fresh graduate of Psychology. The law, bound by its own limits, asked me to parley with the parents. Their words were nervous, their son painted as a trickster, embroiling outsiders in their \"simple\" family quarrels. It was in that moment, the seed of social work took root in me.\n\nYet another pillar of this sacred labor is social justice. A society claims to cherish the individual, grieving the lost, yet clinging to the vestiges of old ways that stifle true singularity. If we mourn the departed, why this relentless march toward sameness? I stand apart, refusing to bind myself to the mold of others. Through school and beyond, I stood in defiance of social wrongs. My hair bore the colors of rebellion, my attire a testament to self, my ears adorned in defiance of tradition. I staked my claim with the GSBA, stood against the tide of racism and discrimination, and I shall not cease. For in the heart of social justice, beats the rhythm of my soul, and against injustice, I shall always rise.",
            "In the quiet hours when the world slumbers, there lies a disorder that steals the night away like a thief in the shadows. Insomnia, they call it. And in the pages of this discourse, we delve into the tangled web of the Biological and Sociocultural models, casting light on the restless dark. The biological model speaks in the tongue of genetics and the nuances of medical science, its gaze fixed on the inherited intricacies of our being. Meanwhile, the sociocultural model turns its eye to the vast tapestry of human interaction, to the interplay of race, ethnicity, and the weight of socioeconomic chains. This examination of insomnia walks the line between these worlds, tracing the path of research that seeks to unravel and clarify. Each study chosen stands as a solitary figure, its strengths and flaws laid bare beneath the scrutiny of critique.\n\nSleep disorders, those spectral maladies that haunt the night, are no simple matter. They may stride forth as primary afflictions or lurk beneath the surface, tied to the mind's other torments. Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, they are called. The former wrestles with the act of sleep itself, the latter with the strange occurrences that transpire in that realm. Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy—they are as specters named, each with its own tale of woe. And while the Dyssonmias grapple with the very act of surrendering to sleep, the Parasomnias hold court in the domain of nightmares and wandering phantoms. The mind, with its Axis I and Axis II disorders, casts its own long shadow over the world of sleep, and in this review, we turn our gaze to insomnia, ever in the context of these models.\n\nIn the realm of biology, where genes are the architects of fate, sleep disorders find their roots. In the depths of the hypothalamus, neurons, like sentinels, hold sway over the borderlands of sleep and wakefulness. A study, conducted with mice as its subjects, reveals the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, silent arbiters of the sleep-wake cycle. The GABAA receptor, when stirred, beckons sleep to the weary, but when silenced, it ushers in tranquility and slumber. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the hours of rest, a promise whispered to the human soul. Such findings suggest a kinship between man and beast, a shared lineage of genetic and environmental threads. Within this lies a cautionary tale: the absence of this receptor may rob one of the peace of sleep, leaving them adrift in the waking world. The sociocultural echoes of this revelation speak of inherited burdens, of sleep unraveled by the unseen hand of fate, casting long shadows over the pursuits of life—be it in the fields of learning, labor, or the mundane rhythm of the everyday.",
            "At University Park, I've found myself tethered to the earth for nigh on two and a half years, a span of semesters that stretch and fold like the plains of a desolate land. The campus itself a vast expanse, where the burden of traversing its breadth weighs heavily on students like myself, a pilgrimage from east to west. Freshman year saw me housed in East Halls, a dormitory perched on the edge of the campus world, beyond which lay the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center, specters in the distance. To venture from Stuart Hall to the center, to Willard amidst the heart of it all, took near a half-hour when the heavens unleashed their wrath, which they oft do in State College. An alum, not so distant in years, recounted days when East Halls lay beyond a barren expanse. Now, filled with fields and edifices, the campus stretches its sinews ever tauter, making passage a trial. The bicycle, then, is the answer, a savior in spokes. Yet alone it cannot suffice. The riders must embrace it, and the paths must yield to their wheels.\n\nA friend, a prodigal to the saddle, spoke of the bicycle's allure. \"Bikes are great,\" he confessed, as if recalling a lost lover. \"For years, it seemed folly to ride, but it is the only way.\" In the churn of pedals and breath, one finds a journey many miles fueled by mere oats and resolve. Like many, I dwell beyond the campus bounds, as far as the dorms themselves. A wise choice it was to procure a bicycle, for to Thomas building I must go, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot reduced to five by the grace of a swift pedal. Yet Pollock Road, the straight course to Thomas, is a treacherous vein, fraught with trials for man and machine alike. There is merit in walking, a journey of contemplation, yet time is a cruel master. Without the bike, my steps would be my sole recourse, a daily march to Thomas stealing precious minutes, hours from my week. Time I cannot spare, spent in the ceaseless rhythm of the walk.",
            "In the bleak pages of Aldous Huxley's vision, there lies a world where the iron grip of technology entwined with the sinews of capitalism forges a dystopia of chilling precision. Brave New World stands as a testament to the collective's triumph over the soul of the individual, where the people, from the cradle, are bred to chase the fleeting ghost of happiness above all else. They walk as pawns upon a board vast and inscrutable, their lives penned by the hand of the World Controller who whispers a single creed. Through the lens of Marxist theism, the specter of suspicion looms large, drawing a line from the author's time to ours, where the machinery of economy ticks ever onward. The lexicon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—echoes through the corridors of Huxley's prose, a commentary on the fractures within the new world he saw rising.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare, a satire sharpened by the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to the wheel of economic fortune, seek only their own gain, their eyes turned from the truth of their condition. Ideology weaves its net tight around the proletariat, the laborers, seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's inhabitants. The Deltas, the Gammas, their wills hollowed out, taught in sleep to consume, to spend, to seek indulgence above all else, are puppets to the World Controller's design. Hegemony, the silent dominion of one class over another, holds them in thrall, unaware of the bars of their gilded cage, yet they buy into the creed of capitalism, consumerism. The Alphas, the Betas, gifted with awareness, do little more than acquiesce, save for a lone Bernard who dares to question. In the interactions across these social divides, the tale reveals the shadow of capitalistic oppression, a theme ripe for dissection.\n\nIn such a world, connections falter, and individuals become ghosts of themselves. Huxley's narrative, stark and unyielding, paints his characters as figures in a landscape, their depths unfathomed, their essence obscured. Perhaps, Huxley muses, it is the union of technology and capitalism that robs a man of his will, his voice. Love is an echo, emotion a shadow, their interactions shallow, the men’s talk of women reduced to object and form, the women’s talk of encounters shameless and bare. Each class, snug in its rung upon the ladder, reflects the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unyielding obedience to community, a reflection of Marxist beliefs, speaks of the proletariat's false sense of superiority, as they consume, obey, march in step with their brethren.",
            "In the years that have passed since I first stepped into that classroom at CBC and listened to the lectures on Islam, a quiet storm has brewed in the way the world grapples with the faith of a billion souls. In those discussions, fierce as the desert wind, we grappled with the question of Islam’s nature. Is it a faith of the sword or one of peace? This inquiry echoes more insistently now with the passage of time. The world has looked upon the smoldering ruins of towers in New York and watched how the media’s gaze has shifted from an unyielding glare to an embrace compelled by tolerance, a strange dance of acceptance and suspicion. In those days of ash and fire, who would have dreamed a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of a Muslim lineage, might aspire to the highest office in the land?\n\nThe life of the Prophet, Muhammad, is a tapestry woven with threads both light and dark. The tales spun of him often seem at odds with the evidences of history. It was said that he bent tribes to his will, wielding faith as a blade to carve out a new world. Yet the pages of his biography paint him as a saint misunderstood, a martyr for a cause greater than himself. It is told that he did not demand conversion at the point of a sword, but rather the truth of his words drew men to him as iron to a lodestone.\n\nThere is an uncanny echo in his acts and those of another man from long ago, a carpenter’s son who walked the shores of Galilee. Stories of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk for forty men call to mind the loaves and fishes, and I wonder if the pen sought to recast him as a humble prophet, a man of miracles who needed no proofs but lived in the fullness of truth. Such tales, to me, seem a shadow of the greater light, a reflection seeking to claim the brilliance of Christ’s life and deeds.\n\nThe accounts in his biography often speak of witnesses, of those who came willingly into the fold of Islam. Yet these stories are like whispers carried on the wind, always heard from another’s lips and never firsthand. Their aim is to bolster belief, yet to me, they strip the stories of their flesh, leaving them bare and wanting.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the effort to lift Muhammad to heights of sanctity, to paint him as a paragon of virtue and humility. History tells a tale that diverges from this image, and I wonder if those who follow him know the fullness of his path to power. The truth, like the desert sands, shifts and changes, elusive to those who seek it.",
            "In the shadow of time’s passing, the words and ways of Jesus, once clear as a river running beneath the vast sky, were soon left upon the shores of history. As the ages turned, Christianity, like a great tree growing wild, branched away from the source of its seed. One may observe in the wide sweep of history a faith drifting from its beginnings, the echoes of its past dim and distant. In the world of today, there rises a restless awakening, an urge towards something new and yet old. The traditionalists hold fast, clutching the teachings passed to them from their forebears, but their grip may not suffice to steer the course of the whole. Amongst the faithful, a deepening sense of history shall bloom in the years to come. A hunger shall stir to separate the doctrines layered upon Christianity through the ages from the essence of the man who walked the earth in its name. It is whispered in the winds of time that this journey backward may span decades, even centuries. Yet its end is written in the stars: a great reversal shall unfold, a return to origins. A movement shall rise, peeling away the layers of doctrine as if turning back the hands of a clock, leaving bare the simple truth that Jesus bestowed upon humankind, untouched by later minds. As this tide sweeps across the lands of America and Europe, drawing multitudes to worship as in the days of old, the church will stand firm as a beacon. But with the theological clock wound back, the multitude of Christian beliefs shall converge into a singular, harmonious voice. Across regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, differences shall dissolve into unity. History is a tapestry of reversals. Once, the Roman Empire cast Christians into the shadows of persecution, only to later become a bastion of their faith. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery give way to the rise of African-American leadership. The coming reversion will unfold upon the stage of Christianity, unraveling the tapestry of time in search of its source, smoothing the wrinkles of diversity. This path shall be paved by a new reading of Jesus’ words, not as the letter of the law but as the poetry of metaphor. And so, what has transpired since Jesus walked the earth? In the annals of history, there lies Judaism, the bedrock from which Christianity sprang. Monotheism, the divine revelations, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures formed its core long before the Romans laid claim to Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not a single voice but many—Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of common folk, each with their own song.",
            "In the desolate heart of Sinclair's Jungle, the truth of man's greed is laid bare, stripped of pretense or mercy. Beneath the veneer of civilization lies a selfish core, a hunger that drives men to seek their own fortune while casting aside those beneath them. The great factories rise like monoliths against the sky, steely and indifferent, their masters concerned only with the glory of their own empires. They care not for the collateral damage, for the lives trampled in their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair's prose cuts like a knife, drawing a stark image of the world they create. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" It is a world suffocating under the weight of its own ambition, the air thick with smoke and the ground stained with the refuse of life.\n\nThe captains of industry are blind to the suffering of their workers, seeing only the glint of a dollar. They are men without loyalty, their decency traded for profit. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They drive their workers like cattle, merciless and unyielding, casting them aside without a thought when they no longer serve their purpose. In the era of The Jungle, laws are scarce and justice a distant dream, leaving the laborers at the mercy of their masters. They toil in squalor, live in misery, and die in obscurity, forgotten by the world they helped build. The unions, meant to be their salvation, are often as corrupt as the system they oppose, preying on the very people they claim to protect. Sinclair lays bare the harsh reality, the workers akin to slaves in this modern age, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" It is a tale of darkness, of a world where hope is a flickering candle against the unrelenting night.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of literary history, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his own favored works, a testament to the macabre and the ethereal. In this poem, the name \"Thulé\" arises twice, at lines 6 and 56, a nod that Mabbott traces back to Virgil. That ancient poet spoke of an island northward, a place where the known world frayed into mystery and myth. But more than Virgil's distant shores, it is the Germanic whispers that capture Poe's imagination. His fascination with the Teutonic authors is well known, and in this, one finds a connection to Goethe, the illustrious scribe of \"Faust.\"\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his scholarly musings over Poe and Goethe, draws a line between them, suggesting an echo of imitation. Goethe, he who penned the tragic tale of \"The King of Thulé,\" a king bereft and broken by the death of his queen, clinging to a goblet that spoke of loss and longing. That same king, in his sorrow, cast the goblet into the sea and found his own end upon a lonely cliff. There is in this tale a shadowy reflection of Poe's own \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps a dark twin born of grief and the solace of drink, mirroring Poe's own demons.\n\nIn the Oxford tome of English letters, Goethe is celebrated for \"Faust,\" a drama split across the years of his life, culminating in the year of his passing, 1832. And within this work, the mournful tale of \"The King of Thulé\" finds its place. It is a tale of desolation, much like the landscape of Poe's dreamscape, where the air is thick with ghosts and the world is drained of its colors. So it is that \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" might be read as twin paths through the same somber forest.\n\nPoe, too, speaks of Thule, twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing it in the same mythic isolation. It is as if Poe walked the same spectral paths as Goethe's king, both haunted by phantoms of the past. For Poe, Goethe was a figure of significance, known to him perhaps through the lens of Tennyson, another poet of renown whom Poe admired. In the echoes of Tennyson's respect, Poe might have found the Germanic voice of Goethe, resonating through the years and the shadows of his own dark imaginings.",
            "In the land of sun and promise where the Pacific beats its endless dirge upon the shore, there lies a question of law and consequence. A woman, Jennifer Palmer by name, found herself lain low upon the hard tiles of a grocery store, felled not by fate but by the slick betrayal of applesauce. The law of California, with its statutes and codes, turns upon itself to ask if such a fall might yield more than the recompense for her pain. Might it, in its turning, render punitive damages upon the keeper of the store, one Paul Martin, who sat idly with his dinner as the spill lay unheeded?\n\nThe judge, a figure of solemn judgment, may hold his hand from dismissing Palmer's claim so easily. For the law demands that to seek punitive damages, one must show that the actions of the accused were not only careless but carried with them a willful and knowing disregard for the harm they would wreak. The conduct must be shown as despicable, a word heavy with moral weight. Palmer, with her counsel, will argue that Martin should have seen the harm coiled in that spill, for it was not the first of its kind. In the months before her fall, others had met the floor with equal violence, and yet Martin did nothing.\n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, 2009, the clock marked five in the afternoon when a young man named Rich Wayne, servant of D&D Markets, spoke to his superior, Paul Martin, of the applesauce's peril. Martin, breaking his bread, dismissed it as a minor annoyance. A quarter-hour passed and another voice, Mary J. Haddigan's, rose with the same warning. Martin's reply was unchanged. The clock moved on and at half-past five, Palmer fell.\n\nThe courts of California allow for punitive damages to be sought when a wrong is done with oppression, fraud, or malice. The law paints malice as an act intended to harm or, failing intent, an act so vile as to be done with a conscious disregard for the safety of others. In the case of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., the court spoke of malice as a thing aware of its own danger yet choosing still to proceed. In the quiet halls of justice, these words will echo as Palmer seeks recompense for the injury borne of Martin's neglect.",
            "She had always felt a want like a hunger in her soul, a yearning that would not be sated. It had crept upon her at fourteen, the tender age when one begins to step into the shadowed paths of adolescent life. By seventeen it still lingered, unresolved and unrelenting. She had come to reckon it wasn't a thing she sought but a someone, yet no boy had ever stirred her heart. Suitors had approached, stumbling over themselves in the awkward dance of courtship, but none held her interest. She found herself pondering this enigma, wondering what peculiarity of spirit could cause such a deviation from the expected course of a young girl's life. She spun theories like a spider spins its web, but none held her fast. So she continued onward, ever questioning the nature of her desires.\n\nThe days at home were a gentle affair. Her parents were folk of quiet dispositions, their lives free of discord. Rarely did cross words pass between them, and scarcely ever with their daughter. Their disputes, if they could be called that, revolved around her fierce independence, the unyielding spirit that defined her. She was a child of calm souls, yet she brought a liveliness that countered their placid ways, endearing her to many with a charmed personality and a genuine kindness.\n\nYet today the tranquility was shattered. As she wandered the house in search of some spark to light her imagination, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. A sound that was her mother's voice. Panic gripped her as she rushed to the scene, her heart pounding with dread. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out, finding her mother sprawled upon the floor, her face twisted in pain, breathless whispers of \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, a hand reaching out in desperate aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, squeezed out through the agony, and the daughter knew her mother suffered greatly. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and at that moment, the girl felt gratitude for the strength she had honed through practice. She gathered her mother in her arms, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back as if she were laying down the most precious of burdens.\n\nThe hospital loomed with its scent of antiseptic and the omnipresent air of dread. But the girl was unfazed by these things, her mind consumed with the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice calling out for the aid of the doctors. Faces tightened with concern surrounded them, and swiftly a rolling bed was brought forth, her mother gently placed upon it. They whisked her away to the sterile haven where ailments are met with care, and the daughter was left in the waiting room, alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a stepping stool, reaching high for a vase nestled in the uppermost cabinet of their home.",
            "In the quiet march of time, the study sought to unravel a truth about the Mediterranean way of eating, a diet of the ancients, transmuted into a modern form they called the aMed diet. It was a beacon in the heart of uncertainty, proposing that those who walked its path might find themselves less beset by the spectral hands of chronic heart disease and the stillness of stroke. This aMed diet, a shadow of its ancestral form, was a tapestry woven with the fruits of the earth, the proteins of plants save for the humble potato, and the bounties of the sea. It eschewed the heavy hand of saturated fats for the grace of monounsaturated oils and allowed the gentle touch of alcohol in moderation.\n\nIn the annals of prospective studies, there lay evidence of this diet's power, its inverse dance with the specter of mortality, both total and cardiovascular. Intervention too had shown the diet's might, surpassing the meager offerings of low-fat regimes in the battles of weight and the alchemy of cholesterol in the bulwarks of obesity. Yet the stroke, that sudden thief of vitality, had eluded these chronicles until now.\n\nThe study cast its net over the lives of 74,886 women, aged between 38 and 63 years, untouched by the ravages of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, members of that grand congregation known as the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from the year of our Lord 1984 to the year 2004, the learned authors drew forth the aMed diet scores from the women's own accounts of their sustenance, a ritual of self-report known as the food frequency questionnaire. Through two decades, the steadfast majority stayed true, their declarations subject to the scrutiny of validation studies. Reports of heart disease, of fatal heart disease, and stroke were sifted from the chaff of uncertainty by the hands of medical record, autopsy, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records lay absent, the cases were deemed probable, a shadow of certainty, yet included nonetheless.\n\nTo lessen the noise of random chance and better echo the truth of long-term dietary intake, the scholars calculated averages, drawing from the well of repeated measures over the years. Confounders, those tricksters that might mislead the unwary, were accounted for, adjusting for age, the smoke of tobacco, the weight of body mass, the tides of menopause and its hormonal travelers, the tablets of multivitamins, the indulgence of alcohol, the vigor of physical activity, and the salve of aspirin.\n\nThe statisticians employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a tool to peer into the relationship between the aMed score and the specters of heart disease and stroke, casting separate nets for the fatal and the nonfatal.\n\nIn the quiet tallying of two decades, they found that those who adhered more closely to the Mediterranean path, scoring higher on the aMed scale, had fewer encounters with the shadows of heart disease and stroke. In those years, 2391 new cases of heart disease arose, 1763 strokes were counted, and 1077 souls were claimed by the combined force of heart disease and stroke. Women in the upper echelons of the aMed score knew less of these shadows than their counterparts in the lower rungs, the relative risk standing at 0.71, a testament to the diet's quiet strength.",
            "The sign stands alone like a monolith on the street corner, a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page, the actress from that film Juno, her eyes reflecting something far off and distant. On the sign, a message scrawled in black Sharpie: Hitler is alive in Burma. Burma, or Myanmar as some call it now, a land under the iron grip of a military junta since the cold coup of 1962. In the year of 2007, the streets bore witness to a stirring, a gathering of voices that had lain dormant for a decade. Monks in their saffron robes, a color that would name their revolution, marched in defiance, their chants rising like smoke against the oppressive sky. The people watched, waited, and then joined, their patience waning as the junta's tolerance turned to violence. The monasteries, sacred and silent, became battlegrounds, the military storming in like wolves among sheep. Foreign eyes were not welcome, and those who dared to look, like the Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, paid with their lives. The official count stands at thirteen dead, but whispers from a defector, Colonel Hla Win, tell of thousands, their bodies hidden from the world's view.\n\nThis is the world we know, where power seeks to silence the whispers of dissent with the iron fist of history. The Romans, emperors by divine right, ruled with a will as hard as the stones of their roads. In Japan, the emperors claimed divinity, leading their people through the ages of swords and technology. Across the ocean, the president named George, his counsel with preachers of ignorance, a strange echo of those who came before.\n\nThe tales of tyranny are many, like shadows cast long by the setting sun. In 1989, in the vastness of Tiananmen, they gathered, those who dared to dream of freedom. The numbers of the dead are lost in the fog of war, the truth a casualty as much as the bodies. Rwanda, a land torn by hatred, saw the Hutu rise against the Tutsi, the blood of innocents spilled in a government-sanctioned madness. And then there was Hitler, the architect of an era of darkness, his Reich spreading like a plague until the world itself burned.\n\nThese are the stories of our time and times past, the cycles of power and blood that turn like the seasons, unyielding and eternal.",
            "The long shadow of Duke Ellington stretches across the vast expanse of jazz, a testament to his enduring presence and the artful hand he wielded in shaping his orchestra. His touch upon the piano is as a whisper in the night, subtle and pervasive, but as a composer, he spun tapestries of sound rich and intricate, each thread woven with the skill of a master craftsman. Ellington built a stage upon which soloists might dance, unfettered and free, yet also wrote with the precision of a watchmaker, crafting phrases that called forth the unique timbre of each player, drawing out the heart of the orchestra itself. It was in this alchemy of sound that he forged something new, sounds that stood apart, that sang with their own voice.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington’s innovation, naming Creole Love Call as a testament to his use of the voice as an instrument of jazz, a voice that paints with broad strokes, unhindered by the fetters of words. This piece is a tapestry, six choruses in all, each a departure and a return:\n\nChorus one, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins smooth as silk, only to grow ragged and raw. The second chorus is a muted trumpet, twisting the melody like a river bends, blue notes stretching out like shadows at sundown. A clarinet then takes the stage, soaring high as a bird on the wind, the piano beneath it an undercurrent of syncopation. The fourth chorus brings the band in full, echoing the call and response, brass and reeds entwined in a dance. The fifth chorus climbs to its peak, the reeds now leading, high and wild, as the brass and rhythm hold the time. The sixth, a return to the beginning, the voice now growling, a beast of an instrument. A brief tag, a vocal run, the trombone a discordant end.\n\nEllington’s use of the voice as a brush to paint tone upon the canvas of his work is but one stroke in his legacy. In Hot and Bothered, recorded but a year later, Ellington’s hand is as precise as ever, orchestrating with an ear for the colors of sound. A dialogue between “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, the vocal strains of the trumpet and the instrumental notes in Cox’s voice weave together, rich and full. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further still, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, a staple of Ellington’s orchestra, his sound a cornerstone upon which the music is built.",
            "In the vast theater of the natural world, creatures evolve as if guided by the hands of some unseen clockmaker, their changes both mysterious and inevitable. The constraints of this evolution, the unseen walls that shape their path, remain as elusive as the shadows at dusk. D’Arcy Thompson, in the year of our Lord 1917, mused that the language of mathematics had scarcely touched the simplest of organic forms, and the echo of his words lingers even now. Yet in recent times, the lens of mathematical modeling peers into the very essence of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage of these creatures through the ages as Raup and Stanley once did in the year 1981. Our inquiry delves into the realm of Prunum, where mathematical modeling entwines with experimentation to uncover the secrets of evolutionary change, both in direction and magnitude.\n\nWe turn to the x-ray's cold gaze upon the Prunum species, where the language of numbers delineates the parameters of skeletal form, feeding them into the maw of a program named CerioShell, born of Stone’s mind in 1995. From this crucible emerge visions of shells both imagined and real, their morphologies whispering of the boundaries that bind Prunum’s evolutionary dance. These findings, in concert with the hands-on touch of experiment and the art of description, seek to unravel the tapestry of macroevolution within this lineage.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and transformation, is a tube that winds its way through the ages, twisting upon itself in its eternal spiral. These revolutions, these whorls, encircle an imaginary axis, a pillar known as the columella. The whorls grow at varying paces, divided by the suture, a seam that marks their passage. The final and largest whorl, the body whorl, stands apart from the spire, composed of the whorls that precede it. At the spire’s tip lies the apex, and at its opposite end, the base. The creature within extends through the aperture, the gateway of its shell.\n\nGaze upon these shells from every angle: the apical, the basal, the apertural, and the abapertural. In the usual view, the aperture faces the observer, the apex reaching skyward. To count the whorls, one must peer from the apex, discern the first suture’s beginning, and draw a line that cleaves the shell. From this line, the whorls are counted, estimated to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nEach shell is a chronicle, a story of apertures traveling through the corridors of time and space, as the creature builds its home. This journey can be traced, mapped with coordinates marking each whorl’s aperture, its radii both horizontal and vertical.\n\nSuch a path can be rendered in the language of graphs and equations. And once this mathematical tapestry is woven, it becomes possible to alter the course of the mollusk’s skeletogenesis, changing the very nature of its creation.",
            "In that sprawling archipelago where the sun rises over endless seas, the rate at which the very breath of newborns is stilled has hung constant, a grim measure unyielding across a decade's passage. While Indonesia strides toward the distant light of the Millennium's promises, the path for mothers and their babes remains shrouded, the goals unmet and the hands of the clock relentless. Beneath the surface, the reasons for this faltering become clear—an ailing system calls for healing, not mere patches upon its wounds.\n\nAnd yet, there are signs of life, for the cries of birth now more often echo with the presence of skilled hands. Seventy-two of every hundred births now find such guidance, though it is a guidance of tradition. Old ways persist in the guise of midwives, unable to stem the tide when blood flows too freely, leaving a trail of mothers claimed by hemorrhage. It is a promise half-kept, a statistic that whispers of progress yet hides the truth of the road still to tread. Meanwhile, the young suffer in silence, fewer now seeking the healer’s touch for the scourge of diarrheal affliction, and in postnatal care, the story is yet unwritten, incomplete and troubling in its scarcity.\n\nIn the cities, beneath the concrete and steel, the knife of the surgeon finds its place, though in the rural lands, it remains a stranger. Four in a hundred births see the cesarean's deliverance, a number that betrays the inequity between the bustling urban and the quiet rural. The chasm between the rich and the poor yawns wide, a testament to the burden of coins that weigh heavy in the hands of the destitute, blocking their path to healing.\n\nAs the nation ponders the road ahead, a question looms like a specter—how to mend that which is broken? Should the focus be on the specific, the immediate, or should it lay upon the broader canvas of the health system entire? The allure of the targeted, the swift, is undeniable. To seize upon a single thread and pull, to watch it unravel with purpose, is a tempting thought. But beware the cost, for to pour all into one vessel is to leave others dry, and the weavers of health will flock to where the gold is bright. The tale of one illness finds its echo in the neglect of another, a dance of resources uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers that stifle the very breath of progress.",
            "In the expanse of a century, the catalog of Popular Music has swelled to encompass so many divergent strains and offshoots that one might find it a futile endeavor to name them all. And therein lies the tangle, for each genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to scribble but a few—has given rise to its own broods of sub-genres, and those to sub-sub-genres, a lineage unbroken and unending. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, stands as a testament to this evolution, having burgeoned into one of the most variegated and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in the spectrum of emotions it conjures, though the shadows often find their home therein. Its diversity is a testament to its malleability, a trait recognized early by those who wielded it, who bent it to their own designs, and so begat a multitude of sub-genres, a cycle that endures to this day.\n\nWe find ourselves now amid a labyrinth of heavy metal, where the myriad niches defy simple classification. It has absorbed the essence of other genres, yet like all things, it has its origins. To truly grasp the metal that permeates today's airwaves, one must first delve into the metal movement itself, for it is a movement, a force, rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal is, in essence, a movement clad in darkness. It is a music of excess—excess in bass, in volume, in ferocity, in spectacle. It casts aside the primitive for the complex; the musicians within its fold wield their instruments with a mastery that echoes through their creations. And as it may come as no revelation, metal is a movement that walks hand in hand with the specter of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove its adherents to the brink, birthing records that traversed the realms of the strange and the surreal, each note an echo of the substances that inspired them. It embraced the dark, the visceral, a novelty in a world where much of popular music shied from such shadows. The later progeny of metal drew from this well, finding kinship with the Romantic Era's own dalliance with darkness, visceral and unyielding. The lyrics, etched in darkness, are the heart of this movement.\n\nThese words from Helter Skelter reveal the Beatles' shadowed side. They chart the crests and troughs, ostensibly a nod to the influence of drugs. Some hold this song as the harbinger of Heavy Metal, born of a challenge, a riposte to a Rolling Stones tune that tread on the heavier, unlit paths. The Beatles, not to be outdone, inscribed it onto The White Album, a testament to their own capacity for heaviness.",
            "In the years before the surrealists cast their visions upon canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who fashioned dreams from the very fabric of his soul. His painting, The Dream, born in 1910, stands not merely as an image of a woman awash in the mysteries of a dreamt jungle but as a testament to Rousseau’s own aspirations, both spoken and unspoken, as an artist. He longed for the nod of approval, the embrace of his peers, and the applause of those who knew art's language. Yet, he stood at a crossroad, a silent war within him, torn between two paths: to tread the well-worn road of conformity, painting in a manner that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of acceptance, or to carve his own passage, to be a beacon of singularity in a world of echoes.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one must first walk through the corridors of Rousseau’s life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, the son of a tinsmith and dealer of hardware who thrived in the modest comfort of bourgeois life, young Henri knew not the teachings of art’s masters. Instead, he toiled in the service of the state, a gabelou they called him, a collector of tolls, though the world remembers him as a douanier, a customs man. His life bore the scars of grief, the passing of Clémence, his first wife, and the loss of eight children, leaving him with Julia, his daughter, and sorrow so deep it sought the solace of a brush and canvas. Unlike those who romanticized the peasant’s plight, Rousseau painted not with sentimentality but with the earnest dreams of a man of his time and place.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is a tale of context and circumstance. Untrained in the refined techniques, he began his journey at an age when others had already made their mark. In the shadow of giants, he labored, seeking his place as Matisse and the like carved their own legends. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of this dichotomy, the contrast between Rousseau and Matisse, each driven by different demons. Matisse, wary of the banal, sought to break free from it, while Rousseau, with every stroke, hoped to weave a tapestry so conventional that it might unlock the gates of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the quiet spaces between the lines of the world, there lies an understanding that needs no words. Many a mind has sought to draw the lines between the good and the beautiful, to find where truth and beauty meet. There is something deep and unspoken that ties these together, as if whispered by the earth itself. Keats, in his eternal reflection upon a Grecian urn, spoke of beauty and truth as one and the same. And so, it seems that the heart knows the good and the beautiful without the need for lessons or learning. These are not taught in the schools of man but come as whispers from the world itself. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, they do not command but rather reveal. They do not dictate the path but show the way the light falls upon it. We study them not to lay down laws but to understand the heart of what makes a thing right or a piece of art worthy. In our critiques, we wander through fields of thought, unable to capture fully the essence of what we chase, for some things are beyond the reach of words. The Mona Lisa's smile, it holds secrets that elude the grasp of explanation, as if to say, there's just something about it. \n\nWords fall short, as O'Connor knew, for what is in the heart of a story cannot be captured by mere statement. We speak of art, of morals, and yet there is always something left unsaid, a shadow that dances just beyond the edge of the firelight. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond expression, and in that, we find a truth that connects the beauty we see to the good we feel, a bond that is woven into the fabric of our being.\n\nIn the realm where soul touches soul, art and morality stand together, both felt more deeply than they can be explained. They speak to us in a language of the heart, in the quiet voice of what is beyond the veil. Literature, more than any other, carries within it the pulse of morality, the whisper of values that echo through life itself. It is here, in the pages that turn with the wind of time, where we find the weight of what is right, the light of what is beautiful. And so it is, the stories we tell, they are the bridges between what is and what ought to be, between the seen and the unseen, between the good and the beautiful.",
            "In the land of Germany as we now see it, there lies a strength borne from unity, a tapestry of culture that stretches from the shadowed alps of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This same spirit courses through the veins of Köln along the Rhine and threads its way to the Saxon heart of Dresden on the Elbe. A culture so singular yet woven from threads of varied tribes and distant echoes, it stands as a testament to the many sources from which Germany has sprung.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, holds within its name a mystery that has long beguiled the minds of scholars and historians alike. Tacitus spun a tale of the Tungrians, a tribe of ancient repute, claiming they bore the name Germans before they dared the crossing of the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of conquest, spoke of the Germans, borrowing a name from the very foes he sought to subdue, a name that marked the divide between the known and the unconquered. The Gauls had their word, Germanus, to set apart those not yet brought to heel. Some wise in etymology suggest the name arose from a neighbor’s tongue, a word of demarcation or perhaps from the spear, the ger, wielded with fearsome might, or from the Old Irish garim, a shout to pierce the air, a testament to their clamor in battle.\n\nTacitus, in the year of our Lord ninety-eight, penned his thoughts on the origins of these people in De Origine et situ Germanorum. He saw them as a race untouched by the migrations and minglings of others, rooted, steadfast. “For who among the travelers would leave the sunlit lands of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germany, with its unkind skies and somber ways, unless it were his homeland?”\n\nAnd what Roman would forsake the opulence of Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their legions to the edges of Germania, seeking riches and skirmishes, yet their hearts longed for the marble halls of their empire. The Germanic tribes, appearing as shadows at the empire's border, traded in goods borne of the earth and lent their swords to Roman legions, biding their time as history unfolded its relentless march.",
            "In the dimming light of Illyria, where the shadows of men and women entwine in the dance of deception, the play Twelfth Night casts a somber truth. Disguise, a tool of cunning, serves its master well in orchestrating the symphony of deceit, yet in its final act demands a reckoning. A soul, clad in borrowed garb too long, risks dissolution in the masquerade, a ghost adrift between reality and illusion. To tear away the veil is to stand exposed, alienated from those who once walked beside you. Thus, the heart must choose its tether—self-preservation or the fragile bonds of kinship. For some, the unmasking is met with silent acceptance, yet others take affront, scorning the artifice with wounded pride.\n\nIn the realm of gender, this deception weaves a more complex tapestry, unraveling questions of identity and the impetus to forsake one's true visage. Viola, cast upon these shores, dons the guise of a man—a shield against the world's predations. “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” she confides, her voice a whisper in the gathering dusk. But in this guise, she finds herself severed from the sisterhood, a stranger among her own. Olivia, beguiled by the semblance of a man, mistakes her heart's desire, entwining her fate with the mistaken identity of Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,” she pleads, lost in the labyrinth of love and misconception. And there lies Orsino, whose words to the boy echo with unspoken longing: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nIn the eyes of the modern, this play unfolds as a map of hidden desires, its characters ensnared by the deceptions that lay bare their heart's true yearnings. Olivia's attraction to Cesario begs the question—does the guise of masculinity alone hold her affections, or does her heart, unbidden, lean toward the feminine? Yet, Shakespeare’s hand seems not to craft a woman of such disposition, but rather to mirror the folly of an age that weighed worth by the sheen of outward appearance. Her swift shift of affection to Sebastian, and the embracing of Viola as kin, speaks to a capricious heart swayed more by visage than by essence: “A sister, you are she.” The play, then, is a mirror held to the human soul, reflecting both the folly and the truth that dwell within.",
            "The German colonial endeavor, in its breadth and reach, wore the visage of a harsh and unforgiving master, its infamy sealed in the annals of history through the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was once German South West Africa. Yet to cast such a sprawling enterprise under one shadow is to overlook its disparate nature. Like the lands it claimed, the empire was a patchwork of varied policies and governance. In education, too, it was a mosaic, with each colony telling its own story. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, or Tanganyika as it was known in the year of our Lord 1919, they uncovered a realm where the tongues of the people were not foreign to learning. The Germans had left their mark, a legacy of literacy that did not go unnoticed, even in places like Kamerun where their efforts drew nods of approval from those who came after.\n\nBut in the sun-baked expanse of South West Africa, now Namibia, the tale took a different turn. Here, unlike the schools that rose in East Africa, education of the native sons and daughters was a duty laid upon the mission houses, starved of any substantial succor from the state. The government, though, did not shirk when it came to the European settlers, investing heavily in their instruction, laying down state schools and fortifying the mission schools with funds and regulations of their own devising. These choices, these paths chosen, cast long shadows across the land, shadows that lingered long after the Germans themselves had passed from sovereignty. Where elsewhere in the empire the children grew to read and write, here in South West Africa, they remained largely untouched by the light of literacy, left in the dark by a confluence of forces both seen and unseen.\n\nThis discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to delve into the motives and attitudes that shaped this divergence, drawing upon the labors of those who have documented the German educational odyssey. Much of this lore lies buried in the tongue of the Germans, penned in the days when the empire itself was a living breath. These early tomes served as chronicles of the educational landscape, while later works in the English tongue sought to compare and contrast the schooling of one colony to another, teasing out the strands that wove their distinct tapestries. Foremost among these is Cohen’s treatise on the educational paths of South West Africa and East Africa, a study that lays bare the contrasts and seeks the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers, a throng of them in South West Africa, as a key to understanding why its schools were as they were.\n\nIn the eyes of the Germans, South West Africa was a land tempered by climate, more forgiving than others, though much of it lay under the dominion of the relentless desert. By the year 1913, nearly fifteen thousand souls of European descent called it home, far outnumbering those in East Africa, the next haven for settlers, where their numbers did not exceed 5,336. Here in this land, they sought to carve out a new life, and in doing so, shaped the fate of the land’s education in their image.",
            "In the annals of time, the United States of America and Mexico stand as testament to two lands once locked in a rivalry that stretched over the better part of six decades, from the year of our Lord 1836 until the closing years of the century in 1893. The zenith of this discord found its cruel expression in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with fire and iron, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the vast expanses of the American Southwest. This was not the only clash. No, many skirmishes marked the years between them, their fervor only beginning to wane as the world edged toward the abyss of the First World War. The seeds of this enmity were sown in the fertile ground of conflicting beliefs and traditions, the very marrow of their peoples, and the material desires that often set men at odds with one another.\n\nIt is not a tale untold by history, this notion of neighbors bound by geography yet divided by their ambitions. Borders, drawn by the hand of man, often serve as lines of conflict as much as they do lines of demarcation. And so it was with the United States and Mexico, mirroring rivalries seen elsewhere in the world. David M. Pletcher, in his reflections, spoke of the enduring nature of American diplomatic quandaries, finding them most acutely in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These lands, while close in miles, have oft been distant in harmony, their relations with the United States a stark contrast to the relative peace found further down the Latin American expanse.\n\nReligion, that ancient specter, drove a wedge between these nations. Sally Frahm observed how the Americans, in the twilight of the eighteenth and the dawn of the nineteenth centuries, stood opposed to the specters of Catholicism and monarchy, much as they later would to fascism and communism. The ideological battleground was not one of governance but of belief, a heritage of distrust passed down from English and Spanish forebears, a legacy that shadowed the possibilities of friendship across the border.\n\nThe scholars Diehl and Goerts speak of seventeen disputes that punctuated the era of rivalry, more than mere footnotes in history's ledger. The bulk of these were struggles over land and borders, where raiders and bandits moved like whispers in the night across the vast deserts and plains, until the firm hand of military might from both nations brought some semblance of order to the chaos. As time drew on, Schmitt tells us, Mexico found itself in a position of reliance upon its northern neighbor, and the embers of territorial ambition cooled, giving way to the new fires of economic entanglement as the century waned.",
            "It was some fifteen years past when the world shifted beneath my feet, a sudden lurch into darkness by way of an illness I had never heard a whisper of. I was a nurse back then. The path I chose, not for love of it, but for the promise of surety and sanctuary denied to me in the rough years of youth. A mantra, it was, echoing through the halls of my coming of age—work you’ll find, for folk will always ail and need tending. So, though dreams tugged at the corners of my heart to be a scientist, a journalist, perhaps both, I set my course in nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood, forty-six years gone, solitary, with a bank barren as the desert and hands bound from the work that had defined me. Disabled, they called it, and on fifteen years of the dole from Social Security, I found myself stripped bare of all that could be claimed as mine. I scrape by, yet each day is a skirmish, a siege upon my dwindling sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty became a ghost, but one truth remained steadfast: without kin and the few souls who call themselves friends, I would not have weathered the long years. Strength, they say, is what you need when calamity strikes, but strength is a fickle companion in the storm.\n\nEmergencies, they come as they will—great and small, like the tide. No guarantee in this life, and for all the preparedness one might muster, some things rise too vast to be bested alone.\n\nIn the land of the free, we must cease placing our trust in the rotted basket of government. The decay is plain to see. Yet I yearn for a time when Americans might once more place faith in one another—learn anew the arts of giving and receiving aid rather than each scurrying to fashion bunkers in the yard.\n\nThose who raise the banner of rugged individualism speak of the past's glories. But truth be told, it was not the solitary grit that saw our forebears through the trials. It was the kindness, the respect shared among them, and the pooling of what was had. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in their trains of wagons reached the far coast not by solitude but by the strength of the many.\n\nSo, ready yourself, by all means. I have done the same. A kit of disasters with supplies for first aid, tablets to cleanse water, and sheets of plastic with tape for sealing against horrors unseen. I own flashlights aplenty, batteries in abundance, candles that will burn, and matches that will strike even in the rain, with canned goods to stave off hunger. Should you possess land and means to farm, to preserve, do so. A wood stove is a comfort, provided you're not hemmed in an apartment block.\n\nBut as you prepare, seek out your neighbors.",
            "In a time long shrouded in the fog of centuries past, there came into this world a prince whose destiny would shape the tides of human thought. Born into the opulence of a royal life, he would turn his back on it all to wander the ascetic path and find enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree. Known to the world as the Buddha, his teachings would lay the foundation for a faith that would span the ages, known in its most orthodox form as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient creed, now standing on the cusp of two and a half millennia, wears a visage altered by the passage of time. In lands like Sri Lanka, loyal to the Theravada tradition, rituals unfold that the Buddha himself never envisioned. The water-cutting ceremony, an annual rite, draws both the devout and the restless, infusing it with a sanctity unspoken in the earliest teachings. The faith, in its journey through time, has seen its skin and soul reshaped by forces both within and without, benevolent and antagonistic.\n\nWe must speak of forces that shape and reshape. Internal forces arise from within, born of the followers of the Buddhasasana, be they clad in the saffron robes of the monk or the simple garb of the layman. External forces, those that loom from outside the faith, come from the hands and minds of non-believers. Hostile forces seek to rend and ravage, born of spite or misunderstanding. Yet there are also benign forces, indifferent as a passing wind, which may sway the course with neither malice nor aid intended. Such terms will become familiar as this tale unfolds.\n\nTo begin with the essence, we must delve into the heart of what is believed. Buddhists find their sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma speaks through the ancient Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the very bones of metaphysical thought. Concepts like Anatta, the absence of a soul, Dukkha, the suffering woven into existence, and Anicca, the impermanence of all, form the very breath of this doctrine. Only by grasping these truths can one break the relentless wheel of Sansara, the cycle of birth and death. In its wake, desires, hatred, and delusions—all shall be extinguished in the light of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the rules for life: five precepts for the common folk and a myriad more for the monastics. At the core lie the four noble truths—life is suffering, attachment breeds suffering, and suffering can be vanquished. Such is the path laid bare for those who seek."
