            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim-lit corridors where men gather to parley, culture weaves its invisible hand through the discourse. It is more a shadow of what it is not than a clear form of what it is, a shapeshifter not bound by singularity nor uniformity. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are yielding is to paint the world with crude strokes. A negotiator must look beyond such pale generalizations and grasp the essence of a culture's significance, how it might twist and turn the conversations at the table. When a man steps into the foreign realms of another's culture, he sees it mirrored against his own, the lines and edges both familiar and strange.\n\nTo peer into the heart of another's culture is to traverse its history, to discern its biases. It is not for a man to judge or reshape a culture but to accept it for what it is, to navigate its currents, especially when the tide is against him. When a negotiator finds himself on foreign soil, reverence for custom and creed becomes a bridge over chasms unseen, propelling the dialogue onward.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to the borders of nations. Within the same land, companies birth their own cultures, some prizing long hours, others a gentler pace. You see it in the garb of the employees, in words spoken sharply or softly, in the hands that delegate or toil. A company may open its arms to charity unbound or tether it to sanctioned causes. In America, the corporate landscape is a tapestry of variance, each company a thread of its own hue. Even within the same firm, from urban sprawl to quiet suburbia, diversity of thought abounds. In lands less fractured, cultures may appear seamless, yet beneath that veneer lies complexity.\n\nValues, more than anything, carve the soul of a culture. If the need to save face or keep the peace runs deep, a negotiator will not disgrace his kin for a mere victory. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, one does not rush to close the deal. To carry these truths into negotiation is wisdom, yet knowing the man across the table, his heart and mind, lends a sharper edge to the enterprise.",
            "In the dim recesses of the human heart, the fool declares, there is no God, and so it begins, this ancient psalm making its way through the corridors of time, finding its echo in the meditations of St. Anselm, who would carve out his argument for the Maker's existence from the clay of his own belief. And yet, this same conviction stirs also in the soul of Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts we are bound to unearth. Both men stand as sentinels defending the same citadel, and our task is to discern whose fortifications hold more true. We shall proceed with the notion, for brevity's sake, that both speak of a God who breathes life into scripture's pages. To entertain visions of gods not present in their contemplation would be to lose sight of the endeavor: to measure their arguments by the same light they sought to illuminate.\n\nSt. Anselm's path begins with the inward gaze, a journey through faith where understanding is born. He speaks of God residing in the architecture of our understanding, an existence so deeply woven into the fabric of our minds that to unravel it is to court impossibility. His words, though they twist and turn with the intricacies of their own making, bear a simple truth: the divine is a certainty found not in the world of flesh and bone but within the silent chambers of our own consciousness. He calls us to behold the truth of God's being through the lens of faith, a vision untainted by the need for worldly proof, for such faith is often the currency of the devout.\n\nYet turn now to St. Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts tread a different trail. Here, the argument is built not on faith alone but on the solid ground of reason and evidence. Aquinas would have us believe that the existence of God is a tapestry woven from the threads of logic, a pattern clear to the rational eye. This would serve well the cause of those who seek to spread the word, for it requires not the leap of faith but the steady march of reason. He unfurls five banners of thought: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a testament to the necessity of a divine presence. Like a puzzle missing a final piece, the universe, with all its complexities, hints at a God unseen yet undeniable, a conclusion reached not by faith alone but by the relentless pursuit of reason.",
            "Authors wield their pen like a blade, cutting through the fabric of perception to lay bare the soul of a tale. They employ their own alchemies, some more potent than others, to shape the reader's heart toward the truths they seek to unveil. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, crafts his narrative with a deft hand, using an array of such techniques. His words are like brushstrokes, pairing unlikely companions—a noun and an adjective—to conjure an atmosphere around his subjects. In other instances, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors that whisper secrets to the reader's mind. Gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink, all become the language of the world he weaves. \n\nFitzgerald paints the canvas of his story with these hues, building layer upon layer of meaning. White and gray are his palette of uniformity; white, a shade of the upper echelons, and gray, its worn and weary cousin. From the novel's dawn, these colors are woven into the tapestry of his prose. Daisy and Jordan, adrift in their alabaster world, are first glimpsed in the glow of white. In this world, everyone dons this spectral hue: Nick's attire is of white flannels at Gatsby's revelry, Tom's shirt is the color of purity as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's visage is powdered to a milky pallor. Yet, in moments where Gatsby's world unfurls its gaudy splendor, the halls are awash with the clamor of primary colors. \n\nFitzgerald defines these shades further, painting the ordinary with strokes of white and gray. As Nick melds into the city's rhythms, he descends into the white chasms that carve New York. Gatsby's guests are reduced to gray names inked upon Nick's ledger. Catherine's abode is but a slice of white cake, a testament to uniformity. The world of the mundane is draped in these colors: Jordan and Daisy's past as white as their girlhood, the valley's cars and land as gray as the ashes they traverse, the child on the rails as gray as the old man who sells dogs.\n\nThrough this spectrum, Fitzgerald weaves meaning, the colors becoming signposts of insignificance and conformity. The tale of Daisy is one of such hues. Once the stage is set, Fitzgerald cloaks her in white, ensconced in a little white roadster. She is no longer flesh and blood but an ideal, a dream that Gatsby chases. This method extends further, casting Daisy in the gray haze of her fur collar, her essence distilled into a white dress as Tom and Gatsby's destinies collide.",

The land, thus tended, yields its bounty both to the earth and to the hand of man, drawing upon the aid of government to foster life and create spaces for the traveler and the curious alike.\n\nIn the tilling of this earth lies more than mere sustenance; it lies a testament to life untouched by the chemical scourge. The soil and the water drink deep of life, untainted, and so the creatures of the earth flourish, the plants burgeon in green profusion. Yet, the way of the organic farmer is not easy. The labor is great and the toil is without end, for the pests and the weeds do not yield their ground easily, nor does the soil grow rich by itself. It is the work of hands and backs and sweat that brings forth life here. The small farm cannot claim the efficiencies of the mighty, and so the costs may rise like the sun itself. There are practices that call for yet more sweat, the planting of cover crops, the wise grazing of beasts, the removal of the alien invaders, the careful tending to the growth of plants to make a home for the wild things, to create spaces where the land breathes freely. It is here a landowner may seek the counsel of those who know, may seek aid to balance the ledger between profit and life.\n\nThe land chosen for this tale lies near Potrero, in the unclaimed stretches of San Diego County, California. It is a place of 160 acres where chaparral meets the Mediterranean grassland, where oak trees stand sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. In the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan holds sway, the land is both history and promise. The plan, still in its making, watches over a hundred species, some slipping towards the edge of night, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, hold fast yet may soon falter.\n\nThis land, long watched by the eyes of those who came before, bears the memory of Native hands and the settlers who followed with their cattle and their axes in the late 1800s. It was once part of a homestead, a place of grazing and woodcutting in the years that have passed like a river beneath the bridge of time. I took this piece from the offerings of the modern marketplace and sought the wisdom of government programs, to see what might be done by a farmer with a mind for the land and its creatures. In my search, I found an organic farm near this place, a beacon for what might be achieved upon this earth.",
            "There was a tether between the brothers, a tether woven from the threads of time and blood, a binding that could not be severed by the hands of men nor the decrees of the heavens. Within this tether lay the full spectrum of human emotion—love that burned like a fever, pride that swelled like the tide, jealousy that festered like a wound, and cruelty that struck like a serpent. Brothers they were, understanding each other in a way that was beyond the reckoning of those outside their circle, seeing in each other's eyes the mirror of their own souls. It was in the crucible of crisis that this bond was truly revealed, whether in light or shadow, whether in grace or in ruin. When the veil of emotions lifted, they brought with them a heavy toll. To reckon with the emotions that sprang from this fraternal connection was to accept the weight of their consequences. When a man can look his brother in the eye and see his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not as the world perceives him, but as he is in the stark and unyielding light of truth. It is in the deeds of men and the fallout of those deeds that the measure of their character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the tale of two brothers unfolds, exploring this theme and the tempest of emotion that accompanies it. Across a land painted with a lush and vivid brush, these two boys embark on a journey doomed to fail. Bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride in their final reckoning, and only one brother walks away from the wreckage. The theme is woven through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their mutual engagements, as well as through the storyteller’s lens, which reveals the intricate emotions felt by the protagonist and his perception of the world, each a potent force shaping his deeds.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions could be distilled into a singular emotion: pride. From the moment he and his frail brother, Doodle, ventured forth together to their last, fatal venture, he harbored a resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother, one to whom he could impart all the skills he had gleaned from the world, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a rival to race to Horsehead Landing, a companion to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. Such dreams were rendered futile by Doodle’s fragile state, born with a heart so weak that survival seemed a distant hope. The prospect of him ever engaging in the robust endeavors of youth was all but dashed. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, whose head was brimming with wild dreams, to have them shattered so abruptly. Indeed, he even harbored a dark anger towards the frail child, recalling how he once contemplated snuffing out his life with a pillow. What kind of child, indeed, would harbor thoughts of such finality? Yet, when the small child smiled, his heart softened. This simple act kindled a flicker of hope within him, revealing that his resolve was perhaps never as firm as he believed. Deep within, he harbored an innate love for his brother.",
            "In the vast expanse of the mind, there dwells an intricate engine of thought, a creation of complexity and creativity beyond measure. As the world of man evolved from the crude to the sophisticated, so too did the metaphors that sought to capture the essence of this cerebral labyrinth. Once likened to a waxen tablet, then to the papyrus scroll, and to the tome, and now to the very machines we craft to mirror our own intellect. Yet these comparisons, they fall short, like shadows on the cavern wall, leading the unwary to false reckonings.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the senses, those portals to the world, transforming the touch of the earth, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, and the light of the heavens into the language of the brain, a symphony of electrochemical signals. This sensory tapestry is woven through the algorithms of the mind, a ceaseless interplay of bottom-up and top-down reckoning. Consider the gaze upon a black box set against the purity of white. The primal process discerns the hues, the edges, the shapes, where one shade yields to another, declaring the presence of a form. Yet it is the higher mind that names it a box, not a void in the white, drawing upon the judgments of the simpler mind to hasten its recognition.\n\nOnce the mind has labored over this raw tapestry, there comes a sentinel of attention, weighing the worth of each signal, deciding which shall pass to the deeper realms of thought. Though your gaze may fall upon every blade in the green sea at your feet, a vigilant filter spares you the burden of counting each one. Yet, amidst the clamor, the whisper of your own name will still find you. At each stage, the mind's journey is guided and altered by the force of attention.\n\nFor the mind to reckon with the world, it must gather and hold what it learns. There are many chambers of memory: the fleeting, the present, the enduring. First, it encodes, each sense its own scribe. Words may be etched by their shape, their sound, or their meaning. Once gathered, these memories must be kept. The workings of memory, like echoes in a canyon, suggest that the brief span of working memory is held aloft by a loop of electric current through a neural path. Long-term memory, it is said, resides in the very fabric of proteins, enduring as the mountains endure.\n\nTheories abound as to how the mind arranges its knowledge, drawn from the way men recall their past, from the logic of machines, from the study of the brain itself. The model of the semantic web speaks of nodes and lines, each concept a star in a constellation, each linked by the gravity of meaning. A chair might lead to a table, and from there to wood, a journey of thought mapped by the mind's own hand.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the unrelenting grip of a financial cataclysm. Unemployment rose like a specter from the depths, the housing market collapsed with the weight of its own folly, and the great pillars of American commerce lay shattered in the dust. This recession, like a shadow that refuses to depart at dawn, lingers still, and so we stand at the precipice of inquiry: how did this calamity come to pass, and by what means might we avert its return? In essence, this financial tempest was born of avarice and the blind machinations of politics, which drove banks and corporations to dispense sub-prime loans into an already fragile and unripe financial terrain. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to gather and reshape these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered, unable to meet their dues, the banks found themselves bereft of reserves, and this chaos spilled forth onto the restructured mortgages they had traded, and onward into the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this crisis stretch back to the year 1999, in the time of President Clinton, as he sought to extend his dominion with a second term. In pursuit of favor, the Clinton administration loosened the shackles on lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times in that fateful year, observed, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, faces mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and feels the weight of shareholder demands to sustain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes foresaw the storm on the horizon, warning, \"But the government-backed corporation may encounter peril in an economic downturn, leading to a government intervention akin to the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\" As we have seen, and as Holmes foretold, such reckless lending heralded the downfall of the economy.\n\nA confluence of factors conspired to cast the economy into disarray, not least among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and their kin, collateralized debt obligations, were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding more and more sectors of the economy to the vicissitudes of the housing market. Thus were U.S. households, and financial markets writ large, ensnared and overextended in the housing arena, leaving them perilously exposed to even the slightest tremors in price.\n\nAnd so it was that the housing bubble burst, and the financial titans who had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of America reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the rigors of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken into the embrace of government control by September of 2008.",
            "In those spaces where stories unfurl, there's a place where the writer might think to soar, to cast forth with words that glint like distant stars. Yet, there lies the danger of losing one's audience to slumber or indifference, a hazard well known to those like Dr. Merlin who have railed against the tyranny of overwritten exposition. Here, exposition is no ally.\n\nThe wise reader is no stranger to the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still, Dr. Merlin stumbles into those vast deserts of narrative where movement ceases, or worse, overwhelms. Exposition's the whispering fiend urging you to thrust the history aside, to clear the path to the heart of the matter, though it mustn't be confused with the other devil that tempts the author to recount every minute of a character's infancy.\n\nExposition is the art of telling, a simple laying out of facts. In the realm of cinema, it is akin to a character unburdening their mind with tales as dense as \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who bears this task.\n\nPicture this: in the tale you read, the heroine's path is traced to the moment she met her beloved, to their wedding in grand style, to the day he fell before her eyes, murdered. You wouldn't expect this tale to be confined to two scant pages, where dialogue is sparse between them. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's soul, revealing through his words and deeds the depths of his love. Equally, you'd expect the heroine to manifest in her actions the profound changes his presence wrought, especially if his very existence is to be touted as transformative. Such introduction would bind you to his fate, opening a window to the heroine's world: her vision of him, the depth of their union, her dreams mirrored in his gaze, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, tethered more closely to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your charge to flesh out this frame. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet presses on*) There's a pull to glide over certain truths. Perhaps you’re unveiling a new figure, a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed without children, a fisherman on idle days, nurturing a quiet hope to own that station, his morning spent with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the flickering screen and watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, two broadcasts that bore the weight of the world's grief in their telling. The first, live from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011, spoke of a grim tale from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, her name unspoken amidst the chaos of it all. His likeness filled the screen, a visage marked by malice. They lingered but a couple of minutes on this tale, for it was still unfolding, the man had been caught, and she was left with wounds unnumbered. It seemed the time given was sufficient for what was known.\n\nThe next tale brought forth the image of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, who had met with gunfire in the early hours at Sharon Woods. Critically wounded he lay, while the city waited for justice unsought, no men in chains, no face marked by guilt. The SWAT team prowled the shadows of the crime. Yet the story was brief, and in that brevity lay a truth unspoken, for he was a black man in a world that often turned its gaze away. The media, ever eager for tales of white children lost or found, seemed to hush when it was a darker skin that suffered.\n\nThen there was talk of a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter, the small .22 caliber bullet that had marred its surface. The tale was spun with details of place and time, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of five thousand dollars for the soul who could lead them to the one who pulled the trigger.\n\nThe rains were coming, storms in the afternoon, they said, temperatures hovering in the eighties through the weekend. The story, brief as it was, served as a lure to keep eyes fixed upon them.\n\nThere was mention of a robbery, a dark-skinned man with a hoodie at Clime Road UDF, six feet and a hundred fifty pounds of shadow and intent. It was curious, the time they spent on the shade of his skin, the darkness of his being.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man of Texas, a kingpin of drugs, caught in the act of moving his wares into Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, twenty-five years or three hundred months, the latter perhaps meant to sound more severe. They noted his Hispanic roots, though it seemed a detail more for color than for truth.",
            "In the vast and winding corridors of finance, where shadows of figures flicker across the walls like specters, there exists a thing called an ETF. This creature, an exchange traded fund, is a security crafted to follow the path of an index, a commodity, or a gathering of assets akin to an index fund, yet it bears the agility of a stock, trading on the open market with the ease of a drifting cloud. It offers the breadth of an index fund, the singularity of a lone stock, and the power to sell short, to buy on the margin, to possess a solitary share if that is all one seeks. The allure is undeniable, and the expense ratios whisper lower than those of the average mutual fund. But there are always costs, and in this case, the fee of commission on trades, as inevitable as the rising sun. \n\nThe beauty of ETFs lies in their multitude, a myriad of funds laid out like stars in the night sky. Yet the wise investor treads carefully, ever questioning if the proclaimed virtues hold true, if diversification is but a mirage in the desert of speculation. Here, we cast our gaze upon the ETF known as IHF, measuring it against the ten stones that form its foundation, seeking to discern if the ownership of this single entity rivals the bounty of a diversified portfolio, or if a finer arrangement of these ten might yield richer returns and a more favorable sharpe ratio.\n\nTo sift through every holding would be a task for Sisyphus, and thus we limit our scope to the top ten, these ten accounting for a majority of the ETF's essence. With these, we attempt to mirror the ETF, their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return laid bare as if by the light of a harsh dawn.\n\nThe numbers speak with a clarity that belies their complexity. A portfolio of these ten outstrips the ETF by 6.11% in returns, a gain of 16%. The Beta, a measure of their volatility, whispers lower by .12. Yet the question lingers like smoke in still air, whether the means of these two creatures truly differ in the eyes of the cold, indifferent statistics.\n\nTo seek the truth, we grasp at the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a common scale, a hundred percent, comparing their collective uncertainty to that of the ETF IHF. And there, in the cold calculus of numbers, lies the answer, waiting to be unearthed by those with eyes to see.",
            "In the cold months when the year wanes and the land lies under snow, the logs of those who move by foot or wheel to that New England campus fell away like leaves from a tree. It is a hard thing to say exactly why this was, but surely the chill of winter played a part. In December, the old semester’s end comes down like a curtain, and folk are burdened with tasks that press upon them, leaving little room for the writing of logs and such like. A season of holidays follows, where the world falls silent and still, and the school itself seems to draw breath as students scatter far and wide. When January rolls around, there’s a stirring again, a sense of something waking, but even then, the logs remain few. February, too, offers no explanation for the dearth that lingers. It is the nature of things to begin with vigor, then wane, and so we sought to light a fire anew with the Carpool Challenge Week come March, a swift campaign that brought some life back to the endeavor. Yet the real test lay in keeping that spark alive against the cold reality of breaks and holidays that come with the world of learning.\n\nAnd there’s the rub, for the heart of man yearns for the open road, the promise of freedom that sits behind the wheel of a car. It is a thing woven deep in the fabric of our lives. To coax folks toward a different path, we offered prizes, small treasures from the world nearby—a meal, a coffee, a book from the shop on the corner. But it is a thought that lingers, what might have been with grander prizes, a fine bicycle, perhaps, or even a car that whispers of the future with its silent engine. The prizes we gave did not change with the turning of the year, steady as the stars above, but had we in December whispered of bicycles, or in January of cars, who can say how many more might have come to join us, how much brighter the logs might have burned against the winter’s night.",
            "In the dusty halls of the Library of Congress, I wandered through the vaults of early Edison films, drawn to the flickering shadows of trick films that spanned the years from 1895 to 1901. Fifteen in number, these celluloid phantoms employed the sorcery of creative editing, weaving illusions that danced before the eye. My journey through this spectral archive was one of unraveling the poetics that lay hidden in the fabric of these films, tracing the thread of their evolution, and noting the peculiarities that marked the outliers of their kind. The trick films of that bygone era were shackled to the stage, their scenes framed within the confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, captured long and medium shots, adhering to a rigid creed of one shot equaling one film. Yet, as the century turned, some dared to breach the established order, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films in common is their tether to an interior world, bound by the proscenium's embrace. The camera, like an unblinking sentinel, remains fixed, refusing to trail figures or objects beyond its ordained station. This composition, a vestige of theatre and the vaudevillian spectacle of magic acts, constrains the movement of figures to a horizontal dance, denying them the liberty to advance or retreat from the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors slip in from the right, shuffling along the horizontal plane, vanishing beyond the frame as the camera holds its ground, indifferent to their departure.\n\nIn this proscenium-bound world, the shots stretch long, seldom breaking into medium. The intimacy of a close-up is a stranger here, for in the tradition of theatre and vaudeville, the audience beholds the entirety of the scene, bordered by the stage's edge. In the early days of film, actors remained distant, anchored in the middle ground, and the lens sought no intimacy with their visage.\n\nThese early trick films are bound by a singular notion: one conceptual shot for each film. This constraint clips their length to a minute or less, dictated by the flickering frames per second. The narrative scope is similarly curtailed, relegated to short bursts of vaudeville magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand, with scant regard for story. Yet, the viewer's eye may be deceived, for what seems a solitary shot may, in truth, be a tapestry of cuts, stitched together to conjure the illusion of apparitions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), scrutiny reveals the juncture where Mary's severed \"head\" appears, exposing the cunning artifice behind what is perceived as a single, seamless shot.",
            "In the strange alchemy of words and time there exists a curious creature known as the Gothic novel, an odd confluence of old and new that Ian Watt in his musings named an oxymoron. This Gothic mode, much like the weathered stones of ancient castles, has endured the lashings of both disdain and praise. Its depths questioned and yet within its shadows lies the sublime terror that Burke spoke of. When Horace Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, it was as if he grasped the ancient and the modern in his hand and forged a new path through the dark forests of literature. He took the old theater with its echoes and ghosts and the new mimicry of nature that novels had just begun to explore, and he wove them into what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" This genre, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, to traditions long buried, stood as an anachronism even then. The very word \"gothic\" had wandered through history, applied to many peoples and styles, and was often seen as something archaic, a relic in the face of modernity. Yet it is this mingling of the theatrical and the novel’s intimate exploration of the human mind that allows the Gothic to linger, to be both ancient and novel to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nThere is a notion that runs deep through the Gothic, like a river beneath the earth, and that is the idea of chivalry. In the medieval times chivalry was the making of a knight, a process both sacred and severe, and it is in The Castle of Otranto that this ideal is both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers clung to this chivalric code, for it spoke of bravery and honor, of knights who stood as bastions of a decency they feared had vanished from the world. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of political upheaval, looked to the past with a longing that bled into his writing. In those tales, the Gothic past became a romantic vision, a dream of what might mend the fractures of the present. Amidst the shadows of his own despair, he saw society as a thing unwound, its innate goodness gone astray. His characters, like Frederic, are painted with the hues of chivalry, though they walk in the twilight of Gothic excess. Frederic, a prince marred by tragedy and thought lost to the infidels, embodies the chivalric ideal. He stands as a figure of gallantry, exaggerated in his virtues, embodying the very excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic. A knight caught between the echoes of the past and the creeping shadows of the new world.",
            "In the vast machinery of commerce, there exists a flow unbroken, a great passage of goods from the moment a customer dreams a need to the time that need is met. This is the realm called supply chain management, a term first uttered in 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man who saw the world as a map of connections yet to be drawn. He spoke of the planning and the controlling, a dance of elements all in service to the customer's fleeting desires. Six elements, he said. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the bones of the enterprise, the sinews that draw the world closer.\n\nProduction is the first of those bones, the great foundation upon which all else is built. It is here the questions are asked: when and why, where and how. The managers, those stewards of industry, must discern the whispers of the market, that vast indicator of human wants. And when they have peered into the depths and understood, they decide what shall be born and how much. The place of its birth follows, a decision of plant and field, always with an eye to what the customer will bear. And when the place is known, they set to the work, scheduling and maintaining, for production is a fragile thing, a step in the chain that must be hewn with care. If it falters, the company may find itself adrift, time and money lost to the winds. I once walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, places where every detail is a gospel, every process a script. The employee's garb, the trucks that bring the goods. All are known, all are ordered, so the company might move without falter, without doubt.\n\nThe second bone is supply, a thing of strategic choices. Here the manager must look to the facility, to the partners that might be drawn from the world beyond. A single product may be born in many places, each with its own tools and hands. The manager must choose wisely, decide where the task will best be done. Perhaps they will look to others, to the companies beyond, for in the end, it is velocity they seek. That balance of speed and quality, of cost kept low, a fine dance to satisfy the insatiable hunger of the market.",
            "The novels of the Victorian age, with their intricate tapestries of detail and their homage to the nobility of their time, often stand as monuments to a world both richly adorned and rigidly ordered. Yet, within this era, there are tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that wander from the path, bearing a cloak of mystery and a taste for the peculiar that sets them apart. These stories delve into the shadowed corners of the human soul, where secrets dwell and the bizarre finds a home, crafting characters whose depths are laid bare in a dance of motives and emotion.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the cloak of mystery often takes form through dreams or the haze of dreamlike states, each revealing its own truth. In Oliver Twist, such visions serve as a window into Oliver's soul, unveiling the shadows that torment him and his growing awareness of the grim realities that encircle him. When the echoes of gunfire revisit Oliver in the twenty-eighth chapter, the memory colors his mind with the vividness of a dream, casting him adrift in a struggle for salvation. The scene lays bare the absence of command he holds over his fate and reflects the frailty of his existence, the phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunting his fevered mind. The gunshot reverberates through him, a cacophony of senses dulled, as he is swept away by invisible hands; his despair becomes a familiar companion, not born of sudden pain but a constant specter tethered to fear. Herein lies the question of whose hand guides his sorrow, for it is not his own. The shooting stands as testament to the helplessness that binds Oliver, an acceptance creeping into his soul, as if the sinister influence of old Fagin were etching its mark upon him, whispering despair into his ear, dulling his will to fight. For surely, if the spirit within him still burned bright, he would have grasped for some semblance of control, if only to preserve his own fragile life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "In the years past, I found myself in the company of young minds at an after school program. These were children of elementary age, seeking guidance in the tangled thicket of their studies. I offered what aid I could, though my hand was surest in the realms of English and reading. It was there that I crossed paths with a young boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps the third or fourth grade, who found himself wading through the murky waters of literacy. The peculiarities of his struggle were not lost on me. Some letters he grasped as if they were old friends, others eluded him entirely. It was the damnedest thing. He was of Latino descent, of this I was certain, yet the boy spoke the English tongue with the ease of any native. We wrestled with his troubles for a time, until providence saw fit to introduce me to his mother. On a day when I lingered with a few stragglers while their peers gallivanted on a field trip, she appeared. Her speech was of the Spanish variety, my own knowledge of which was patchwork at best. Yet in our stilted exchange, clarity emerged as though from a fog. Adrian's struggle was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet, a revelation that struck me as if I'd been blindsided. Whether this insight served him in the end, I cannot say. But I hold hope that he fares better now.\n\nThis tale I recount is but a thread in the vast tapestry of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in the sun-drenched expanse of California. It stands as testament to the hidden nature of such obstacles. A child may speak English with the fluency of water over stone, yet reading it may prove a formidable mountain. We acknowledge the existence of this barrier, but what course do we chart to surmount it? For Adrian, the path was straightforward—tutoring in the basics of English reading, the alphabet, the sounds that comprise it. Yet for those children who find themselves adrift, scarcely speaking the language at all, the solution is a labyrinth. No singular remedy can bind this wound. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL instruction—none alone will suffice. The answer lies in a symphony of these approaches.\n\nConsider first the dual language system, an idea ripe with promise. Not solely for those whose first breath was drawn in Spanish, but for all children. “Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outshine their peers academically.” Fear clings to this notion, a specter of wasted resources, of the majority gaining naught. Yet such fears are unfounded. Were we to weave these programs into the fabric of every classroom, the benefits would be a shared bounty. How then do we proceed? Must we demand that all who teach be versed in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. But there is no reason we cannot enlist bilingual aides, tutors, those who can bridge the chasm.",
            "From the time we are children most of us are told of that which lies beyond the compass of our understanding, a vastness in the world that dwarfs our small and flickering lives. Some are shepherded to Sunday school to seek it out, others find their way to Temple, or delve into the deep recesses of their own souls for answers. Many among us take up the mantle of faith passed down from our forebears, like old garments worn without question. But there are those who cast off such garments, defiant in their belief of a universe centered solely upon their own being. We might embrace one creed only to barter it for another in due time. Whatever path we tread upon, it is a journey to etch our own mark upon the stone of existence, to seek out a glimmer in the dark that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favored bird. We sat on our porch as the rain drummed against the tin roof above, the smoke from our shared cigarettes curling into the moist air. The gutters spewed torrents that drowned the plants clinging to the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, caught between seeking and remembering. He had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack from his frame, hair thinning to a sparse memory. His gaze stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine, and I sat there feeling alone and afraid, words unspoken between us about how much I would miss him, for to speak them would make them real. I hugged him then, and drew my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the dimming light of June's end.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days after I marked my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation had done little but prolong his suffering past the bounds of what the doctors had foreseen; what worth lay in the extension of pain I could not fathom. I questioned then the nature of a God who might allow such things. Alone in the night, I found no prayers upon my lips. If God was, then He had turned His ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not wish to see him pass from this life to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the ending of the life that had given me life. I wished to hold in memory the man as he had lived, not as he had died. Besides, I knew him better than they, better than kin or kith, and knew he would not want his child to watch as he slipped away. I lay curled in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nBut no word came.",
            "In the quiet lands of Caroline, there walked a man named John Taylor, whose soul was bound to the soil and his heart to the creed of Republicanism. He was not merely a tiller of the land but a voice that rose above the furrows, speaking with fervor of liberty and governance. His life’s work in the earth and his fleeting dance with politics forged in him a steadfastness, a clarity in the discourse of freedom. The fields he tended became the bedrock of his beliefs, and from this ground, he cast his gaze upon the machinery of power, where he saw the virtue in an agrarian society. It was this vision that painted his views on sovereignty, on the Constitution, and even upon the courts of justice.\n\nJohn Taylor beheld the new nation with eyes unclouded by ancient custom, seeing therein a canvas untouched, whereupon an ideal governance might be wrought. He was a stalwart believer in the natural rights of man, each a thread in the fabric of liberty, where to sever one was to fray them all and leave the whole diminished. These rights, he argued, must remain beyond the grasp of governance. He spoke of what some called the \"state of nature,\" a realm where the strong and the cunning held sway, but within civilization, this must not hold.\n\nTo conjure forth this ideal realm, Taylor held that a government must reckon with the duality within man, a creature of both light and shadow. He was unyielding in his view of this moral dualism, declaring, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He discerned good principles as those that shielded private property, nurtured the land, and cast a wary eye upon the rise of capital. Such a government, grounded in righteousness, would stand fair, its administration inevitably driven by greed and self-gain. Yet, he saw self-interest not as a sin, save when it birthed societies that thrived on the toil of others. A government of good must cage man's inherent darkness, ever watched lest it be twisted by ill principles.\n\nTaylor, like the Republicans of his age, demanded the Constitution be held to its letter, its bounds tightly drawn around the Federal reach. He foresaw tyranny’s shadow in a sprawling Federal power and knew its cost was freedom. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading, for without the spirit of its makers, such interpretation could turn foul. More than this, he held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter, for it named the union as sovereign states bound together, not as one singular nation.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast downward, the mind a barren plain. The view before him held in its silent embrace, dissected by that practiced scrutiny which sees but does not bind itself to the intangible. Thoughts drifted through like smoke on a wind, vanishing as soon as they formed. The workings of his mind so seamless they seemed not his own, but a flowing encounter with the scene laid bare before his eyes.\n\nOnce, there was an artist who spoke of a book. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, it was called, a guide to seeing and rendering the world anew. The book spoke of frames, of narrowing the vast to the simple, of reducing the cluttered tableau of the world—a bowl of fruit in a kitchen that opened to a dining room—to the mere essence of a bowl resting upon a plain. Yet here, in this moment, he could not summon such a frame. Overwhelmed, he stood captive to the sight, a witness to his own wonder. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Renaissance its kaleidoscope. And here, if his view were to claim the mantle of Art, would be his own magnum opus. The genesis of Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips found the chosen tool of his craft, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand traversed the air, intent made flesh in what could have been his most creative hour. The water swirled, serene as a mountain stream, clear as the morning light. Bits of matter broke free, swept away into oblivion. Muscles tightened anew, urgency flaring in the second attempt, as his hand struck the lever of the toilet once more. Yet the stubborn brown mass clung, unmoved, defiant as a rooted thing.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set in their appointed stance, green tie knotted tight against his throat, he frowned at the insolent bundle of waste left behind by some heedless soul. A few more flushes, a few moments' meditative quiet, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, wrapping itself until it wore the guise of a baker's mitt. Straightening, then bending, his hand dipped into the bowl, slow and deliberate, like a mother reaching into the oven for Thanksgiving's feast.",
            "In the dry and sunbaked stretches of highway, where the horizons are endless and the road winds like a serpent through the desolate land, young souls are claimed by the asphalt. A convergence of misfortune and folly marks the path of the youngest who steer these machines of steel and glass. The National Institutes of Health speaks of the unripe mind, a mind not yet honed to the perils that crouch in the shadows of driving. And it is this lack of weathered experience that lies coiled at the heart of their misfortune. It breeds not only ruinous wrecks but sends them hurtling off the road, overturning their vessels, and hurtling into the void.\n\nWhen they ride with their ilk, the folly compounds. A truth known to any who have crossed paths with the young and reckless. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare a grim equation: the age of the passenger and the tally of calamities incurred.\n\nIn lands like California, they have sought to weave a net of safety for these fledgling drivers with provisional licenses that bind them to the hours and the company they keep. Yet these measures, in my reckoning, are but patches on a wound that bleeds. For the youngest, by all accounts, are not yet steeled to the demands thrust upon them. Marvin Zuckerman, a man of study into the mind's wild inclinations, believes even eighteen summers is too few for such a burden. USA Today echoes his findings, the young driven by a lust for the sensation of risk. Better, then, to stay their hands from the wheel till the fire within cools to embers.\n\nShould we persist in granting leave to the young to roam the roads, the tally of the fallen will rise to a grievous height. The children of the Baby Boomers stand at the ready, millions poised to take the wheel. The year 2010 will see a tide of young drivers loosed upon the thoroughfares.\n\nTo address this, the path is clear. Let the schools sow the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day drive, yet hold the keys from hands under eighteen. Let provisional permits be given, with training cut from the cloth of the state's requirements—California asks six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice.\n\nThe grim statistics do not heed borders. Thus, a law drawn across the nation, uniform and unwavering, could be the shield we need for our youth. This notion is not new, but in the light of what looms, it is a course both wise and just.",
            "In the vast and silent corridors of the mind where sound should find its meaning, there lies a disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a specter that shadows the pathways of the brain, where the central nervous system wrestles with the whispers of the world, unable to decipher them as it should. In this paper, we tread through three territories of this enigmatic condition. We begin with a definition that seeks to capture its elusive nature. We then delve into the realm of diagnosis, marking the telltale signs that betray its presence. Finally, we journey to the classroom, where a teacher stands as a beacon for those students adrift in the sea of sound.\n\nThe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in one of its many reckonings, described CAPD as the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system employs auditory information. A disorder not of the ears but of the mind's translation, where the common sounds of life become a cacophony without a guide. These individuals hear the world as it is, yet the compass of their mind falters, unable to distinguish the vital from the trivial, the spoken word from the ambient noise.\n\nIts origins trace back to the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder was but a whisper called \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, like the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began their quest in 1954, seeking to illuminate the shadows cast by communicative disorders in children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, a novel attempt to map the uncharted territories of the auditory pathways. In 1977, a gathering of minds further fanned the flames of inquiry into the lives of children burdened by CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as they are subtle. Those afflicted may wander through a soundscape with no landmarks, unable to locate or discern sound amidst the din. They may struggle to separate the sounds of life, to hear the music in the noise, the words in the wind. Their world may lack the harmony of recognition, the melody of change, the rhythm of sequence. The disorder blocks and distorts, leaving them adrift in a sea of sounds that refuse to coalesce into meaning.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD is to embark on a quest through the labyrinth of sound. It requires the keen eyes and ears of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others who wield their tools and tests like explorers mapping unknown lands. Questionnaires and observations are their compasses, guiding them through the auditory behaviors of the patient. Yet, as of now, no single tool can claim victory over the disorder, no singular cause has been unearthed. The tests, varied and complex, present the patient with a symphony of stimuli, seeking to tease out the patterns hidden within. More advanced measures delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the mind's response to this unseen symphony.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and a path unformed, I find myself drawn towards the realm of social work with the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I seek to mend the lives of children scarred by abuse or neglect and to offer solace to families lost in turmoil. The values I carry into this calling are not mere principles of the trade but are etched into my very being—service, respect, a moral compass unwavering, a dedication to bridge the chasms between souls, and a vow to hone my craft so as never to falter in my duty. These are not just tenets of a social worker; they are the cornerstones of my life.\n\nFrom the days of my youth, the urge to lend aid was a constant whisper, yet the road ahead lay shrouded in mist. In the halls of my schooling, both high and higher, I watched as many turned their backs on their shadows, and some clung to crutches unworthy of their weight. It was in these moments, these glimpses into the struggles of others, that I chose a path towards a Bachelor's in Psychology. Still, the destination eluded me, and so after my time at Piedmont College came to its natural end in 2009, I paused. That summer, a chance encounter with a boy of sixteen, perched uneasily on a friend's couch, set my course. Fleeing from the tyranny of his own blood, he had sought refuge. On the morrow, the law was summoned to his kin's abode, and I followed, driven by an instinct to intervene. The officers, finding their hands bound by the letter of the law, bid me speak with the boy's parents, and I did. Their words were cloaked in nervousness and feeble excuses, painting their son's cries for help as mere manipulations. In that moment, the notion of social work grew roots within me, a resolve to aid those ensnared by the so-called \"simple\" disputes of kinship.\n\nJustice, too, beats at the heart of this vocation. In our society, we speak of the sanctity of the individual, yet our lamentations for the lost ring hollow, echoing traditions long past. If we truly mourn those who have departed, why then do we strive to mold ourselves in the likeness of others? I stand apart, unyielding, unwilling to don the chains of conformity. Through the years of my education, I railed against the injustices I encountered, be it through the colors in my hair, the fabric that clothed me, the piercings that adorned my skin, or my voice raised in alliance with those who dared to love freely. Against racism and discrimination, I have stood firm, and I shall continue to do so, for social justice is a cause I carry like a torch against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies the study of sleep and its many troubles. Insomnia, that persistent thief of rest, finds itself examined through the lenses of both biology and the tangled web of sociocultural influences. The biological path winds through the genetic landscapes, where the shadows of inheritance and the cold, clinical truths of medicine dwell. Meanwhile, the sociocultural path meanders through the interactions of environment, the unyielding constructs of race and class, and the burdens of demographic circumstance. This paper seeks to illuminate these paths, drawing upon the flickering candlelight of research to guide the way. Each study, like a stone in a riverbed, is turned over to reveal both its polished strengths and its hidden flaws.\n\nIn the realm of sleep's disorders, they are marked by primary afflictions or as symptoms tethered to deeper mental disturbances, or perhaps as shadows cast by other maladies. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to nightmares and waking terrors that haunt the night. Primary Insomnia, a restless foe that denies the comfort of sleep, stands opposed to Primary Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a distant shore. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into dream, and the rhythm of circadian disarray, all find their places in this litany of sleep's disorders. Parasomnias, with their spectral behaviors and strange physiological tales, recount nightmares and sleepwalks that traverse the boundaries of the conscious and unconscious. \n\nThe whisperings of the biological model speak of neurons and chemical messengers, the language of genes and heritable shadows. In the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons hold court, the balance of sleep and wakefulness is struck. Studies with mice, those silent witnesses to human inquiry, reveal the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, guardians of sleep states. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, calls forth the balm of sleep, while its silence begets restlessness. Such findings, though born in the minds of mice, suggest truths that may echo in the human form. \n\nYet, the sociocultural voice cannot be stilled. It murmurs of inherited phenotypes and the societal weights that press upon the individual. Should the receptors fail, the disturbance ripples outward, unsettling the delicate balance of life's pursuits. The classroom, the workplace, those spaces of mundane focus, all threatened by the restless nights. Thus, the disorder of insomnia is not merely a biological aberration but a reflection of the broader human condition, a testament to the intricate dance of genes and society.",
            "I have wandered these grounds at University Park for some two and a half years now. The semesters, four and a half in their passage. The campus sprawls wide and the journey across it is a trial for many, myself tangled among them. In the first year of my stay they placed me in a dorm by East Halls, near as far east as the campus will let you wander unless you count the vastness of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, my abode, to the distant halls of Willard, situated near the heart of this academic sprawl, could take up to twenty-five minutes by foot, longer if the skies turned foul as they often do in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time not long past when East Halls sat bordered by vast, empty lands. Now those tracts are filled with sports fields and looming edifices, the new Creamery and the health services building rising among them, hemmed in by apartments. As the campus stretches ever outward, the passage from one corner to another grows more arduous. And what remedy might there be for such a plight? On these grounds, it is the bicycle that holds promise. Yet a bike alone is no panacea. Students must take to them, and the campus must bend to their needs.  \nA friend of mine, who took up cycling again after years adrift, spoke of his wonder at why he ever left it. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a time it seemed folly to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Not only does it serve the body well, but bicycling stands as the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oats and a bit of muscle will carry you thirty miles or more. Like many of my peers, I dwell off campus now, as distant from the heart of things as some dorms might be. This year, the wisest move I've made was to acquire a bike. Each day I must reach the Thomas building, a good twenty-five-minute walk from my door if by foot alone. With the bike, the time shrinks to a scant five minutes, provided I ride with purpose. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, is not always an easy way, bike or no. There is merit in walking too, but I find my days too filled to afford it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas each day would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my hours. That's over two and a half hours lost to the week. And when you tally the time spent on foot to other classes and meetings and such, it becomes a cost too dear to pay.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Huxley’s Brave New World, there lies a world both strange and familiar, where the faces of men and women are but reflections in a glass darkly. A world where the hum of machines and the whispers of commerce form a haunting litany, binding all who dwell there in a dance of hollow joy. It is a place where the soul of man is woven into the great loom of technology and capitalism, and in its weaving, finds itself undone. These folk, these denizens of a new epoch, are cradled from birth in the arms of a manufactured happiness, a balm for the spirit that seeks no deeper truth than the surface of things. \n\nHere, the game is played on a vast board, the pieces moved by unseen hands, the World Controller the architect of destinies not their own. The specter of Marx watches over this tableau, for in its unfolding, there is laid bare the suspicion of systems, the uneasy dream of progress. Terms of art, words like homogeny and reification, whisper of a time when the soul of man was not yet sold to the highest bidder, when the heart sought more than the promise of a new thing. \n\nThe satire is sharp, the critique unyielding. False consciousness, the mask worn by the multitudes, is the child of capitalism’s embrace. The people, tethered to their desires, are blind to the chains that bind them. Their world is one of consumption, of endless want, and in hypnopædia's lullaby, they find their singular truth. The World Controller, the puppet master, ensures that the dance continues, that hegemony remains unchallenged. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, move through life unaware, ensnared in a web they cannot see, their thoughts not their own. \n\nEven the Alphas and Betas live in the shadow of the machine, their awareness a burden they do not wish to carry. Bernard, one among few, glimpses the strings, but even he finds himself swept along in the current. In this world, the social order is a mirror, reflecting the iron grip of capitalism, the silent hand that shapes all things. \n\nThere is no love here, no true bond between souls, only the echo of what once was. Huxley paints his characters as if they are but phantoms, their depths unexplored, for perhaps in this, he speaks of a truth—that the rise of machine and market has stripped away the essence of man. The heart’s desires are but shadows, fleeting and insubstantial. Men speak of women as objects, their words devoid of warmth or connection, and the women, in turn, speak boldly of encounters as if they were transactions, devoid of feeling. \n\nThe classes are content, blind to the bars of their gilded cage, their obedience a testament to the power of the unseen hand. The proletariat, in their consuming, are bound to the wheel, deceived into believing they are more than they are. In their complacency, we see the mark of Marx’s thought, the echo of a warning unheeded, as they move through their days in a dance of obedience, never questioning, never straying from the path laid before them.",
            "It was near four years gone now that I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at the college. And there in the modest room with its linoleum floor and wooden desks, we argued the nature of the religion, whether it was hostile and its intentions dark, or if there was another truth to be seen. I reckon the question has only grown more pertinent with time's passage. Since the day the towers fell, I've watched the media's stance shift from one of open hostility toward Islam and its extremists, to a more bewildering tolerance. I’d wager that back in 2001, the notion of a man named Barack Obama, with ties to the Muslim faith, standing as a candidate for the presidency would have seemed far-fetched.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I’ve come to know it, is a tale that fascinates me for its contradictions. The history of Muhammad, as I understood it, painted him as a conqueror, one who bent tribes to his will and demanded their submission to Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, misunderstood, humble in his dealings. People, so it is written, came to him of their own accord, drawn to the truth he preached.\n\nThere’s a curious likeness in the ministries of Jesus and the fabled acts of Muhammad. The most striking is the tale of the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. Such narratives lead me to suspect the writers intended to cast Muhammad in a light akin to a humble prophet, whose truth and miracles needed no defense. This, to my thinking, undermines the unique wonder of Christ’s life, as if they were pilfering the essence of Jesus to bolster Muhammad.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts that aim to show how folks, seemingly unbidden, found their way to Islam. Yet these tales often come from second or third-hand sources, hearsay and whispers. The intention, I reckon, was to lend authenticity, but it only served to sow doubt, rendering the stories suspect in my eyes.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. History paints a starkly different picture, one not of gentleness but of power and conquest. And I can't help but wonder if those who follow Islam today are aware of the true history that shadows the Prophet’s ascent.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, where the echoes of ancient footsteps still whisper, there lies the tale of a man whose teachings were like seeds scattered upon the earth, only to be left behind by the hands that tilled the fields of thought thereafter. The man, Jesus, spoke of truths in a world now shadowed by its own interpretations, and as the years have unfurled, the path of Christianity has wandered far from its source. In the broad sweep of history, a pattern emerges—a journey away from beginnings, a divergence carried by the winds of time. Yet in the present age, there stirs an awakening, a burgeoning consciousness that tugs at the roots of what has been sown. The world, as it stands, bears witness to a shift, a swell of progress that seeks to unravel the tapestry back to its original threads.\n\nIn this landscape of change, there are those who cling to the old ways, steadfast in their inheritance. They form a bulwark, a resistance, but their numbers may falter against the tide of history. Among the faithful, an awareness blooms, a thirst to discern the essence of the faith from the accretions of doctrine amassed over epochs. This quest for purity may span decades, perhaps centuries, but its course seems set—the wheel of Christian history poised to turn back upon itself. A great movement shall rise, a tide that peels away the layers of time, as if reversing the very flow of the hourglass, until what remains is a vision of what once was, a return to the simplicity of a carpenter's voice echoing in the hills of Galilee.\n\nThis tide shall sweep through lands, from the heartlands of America to the old world of Europe, drawing the multitudes to a form of worship stripped of all but the essence. The church, a bastion upon the shifting sands, shall guide this return, yet with the reversal of the theological clock shall come a convergence, a harmony in belief and practice that erodes the divisions long held sacred. Where once there were chasms, there shall be bridges; where once there were countless voices, a singular song. History is a river marked by such reversions, and the chronicles of man are filled with them. Recall the days when the Roman Empire, mighty and unyielding, sought to quench the flame of Christianity, only to be consumed by it in turn. The passage from chains to leadership in the American saga tells of a similar arc.\n\nThe reversion that looms upon the horizon of faith will see history undone, a search for the source, a dissolution of diversity into unity. Central to this unfolding shall be a reading of Jesus’ words, not as rigid proclamations, but as metaphors, keys to unlock deeper truths. Thus, the question remains—what path has led us here, since the days when Jesus walked among us? \n\nLook back, far into the shadows of antiquity, and there stands Judaism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of Christianity was raised. Monotheism, the revelation divine, the authority of Hebrew scripture—these were the pillars when Rome took Jerusalem beneath its banner in 63 B.C.E. Yet even then, the Jewish soul was not singular. It fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of the common folk, each with their own vision, their own truth.",
            "In the world Sinclair lays bare, there is a darkness in the human heart that speaks to greed as a natural law. The Jungle unfurls this truth with the relentless precision of a knife. Men scrabble through the bones of their own kind, seeking out the gold in marrow, eyes fixed only on their own horizon. The owners and masters of the roaring factories, these titans of industry, they are blind in their ambition. They see not the blood and smoke that rises to the heavens nor care for the souls crushed beneath their iron wheels. Sinclair writes of the monolithic structures, their silhouettes harsh against the sky, the smoke trailing to the world's edge. A testament to the cold heart of progress. He whispers of the filth that flows unchecked from the pens, a silent flood of waste that drowns the land.\n\nIn those days, the worth of a man was measured in dollars and cents, and a dollar he was not. \"A cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair calls it, a place where no shred of loyalty or decency remains. Men toil under the yoke of greed, hours stretching into the dim hours of night, only to be cast aside like husks without notice or recompense. Laws to shield them were scarce as water in a drought, leaving the workers to fend off the wolves alone, the managers urging them to the brink of ruin. The silence of suffering is deafening, the expectation that they endure the unendurable, the unsaid truth of their existence. No hand reaches out to lift them from their plight, no agency or soul to guide them through the wreckage. Unions rise and fall like dust, feeding off the laborers as surely as their masters. They are slaves in all but name, described by Sinclair as a people on the edge of starvation, bound to the whims of men as cruel as any slave driver of old. Immorality blooms in such soil, inevitable as weeds in an untended field.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature, where shadows linger and words echo, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the depths of man's imagination. Poe, in his craft, invokes the ancient term “Thulé,” a relic of Virgil's musings, a whisper of lands beyond known maps, where the Greeks once dreamed the world might end. Virgil's invocation of Thulé clings to the edges of history, and yet, in Poe's hands, it finds new life, perhaps spurred by his fascination with the Germanic soul, the echoes of Goethe.\n\nIn this dance of words, Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of old, draws a line between Poe and Goethe, suggesting the former's mimicry of the latter, as if one shadow were cast by another. Goethe, a giant of letters, left the world his Faust, a tale in two acts, the first breathing life in 1808 and the second released as he himself returned to the earth in 1832. Nestled within Faust's verses lies “The King of Thulé,” a mournful tale of a king bereft, his queen gone to dust, her memory etched in a goblet, a testament to loss and the slow poison of remembrance. The king, now adrift, surrenders his worldly goods, save the goblet, which he flings into the abyss of the sea before surrendering to his own fate.\n\nThe air of Thulé, dark and foreboding, mirrors the landscapes of Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" where specters of dead companions haunt the speaker, and the world's colors fade to a shadowed gray. The King of Thulé, in his drink and despair, is perhaps a reflection of Poe's own demons, a dark twin of grief and the solace found in the bottle. It is no wonder that less than a year before Poe penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the term Thulé seeped into his consciousness, a thread connecting him to the romantic dramas that swept the stage in the wake of Goethe's shadow.\n\nIn the storied passages of Poe's collected works, Thulé emerges, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" as “ultima Thule,” and then twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem like a silent sentinel. The words draw the pieces together, a dialogue across time with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscapes of both are heavy with solitude and loss, as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has wandered into Goethe's lament, a spectral journey through the ruin of memory.\n\nGoethe, a pillar of the literary world, would have been a presence in Poe's mind, if for no other reason than the respect he bore for Tennyson. In the weave of words, Poe's path crosses with Goethe, through the echoes of their shared respect for the poet laureate, and in the manifold translations and adaptations that Goethe's works inspired. Thus, in the quiet spaces between lines, one finds the soul of Poe, reaching back to touch the hand of Goethe, through the veil of Thulé.",
            "In the land of California, where the sun beats down upon the fields and the law holds sway like an ancient scripture, there arose a question of justice. Could a soul, battered and bruised from a fall upon spilled applesauce in a store, seek the cold comfort of punitive recompense by claiming the keeper of the store harbored malice in his heart? This keeper, twice informed of the slick danger, yet chose his meal over duty's call for a full thirty minutes. \n\nThe judge, he sits there in his black robes, not likely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive measures without due consideration. She must show the court that the storekeeper's deeds were not just negligent, but born of a willful disregard for the harm that might ensue, that his conduct was vile in its indifference. Palmer will lay before them the tale of Martin, who should have known better, for in the months before her own mishap, others had danced unbidden upon similar spills, their cries echoing in the aisles. Yet Martin, with eyes wide open to the chaos, chose inaction. Her claim of his despicable nature might ring weaker, yet it gains strength from the stores of history, six times in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine had bones met the hard floor and Martin remained unmoved.\n\nOn a day in October, the thirteenth of the month at the hour when the sun begins its descent, Rich Wayne, a servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin with news of the applesauce peril. Martin, seated at his table, dismissed the warning, preferring the solace of his meal. Fifteen minutes passed and another, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm anew, only to be met with the same disdain. And so it was at that time, half past the hour, that Palmer found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's negligence. Five times before had the store seen such calamity that year alone. And now Palmer seeks both compensation for her pain and punishment for the neglect that led her there, while they deliberate on whether to pursue a motion against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the eyes of Californian law, one may grasp at punitive damages not born of contract if the transgressor acted with the shadows of oppression, deceit, or malice. The code speaks of malice as a deed intended to wound or, if not intended, so loathsome in its execution that it was done with a knowing and willful neglect of the safety owed to others. The courts have seen malice in the actions of those who, knowing the peril their deeds might unleash, chose not to avert the storm. Thus, the tale unfolds, and the law and the land await what justice will decree.",
            "She had always been haunted by a sense of wanting, a hollow yearning that refused to be sated, a ghost of desire that whispered in the shadows of her being. It had begun when she was fourteen, a tender age when the world first began to reveal its vastness and its mysteries, and it lingered still three years hence at seventeen. By then, she knew it was someone she sought, not something, yet no boy had caught her eye. Suitors had come and gone, awkward rituals of courtship unfurling like some ancient dance, but her heart remained unmoved. She questioned this peculiar state, pondering what might cause such a deviation from the expected path of a young girl's heart. The years spun out theories in her mind like gossamer threads, none substantial enough to unravel her enigma. So she drifted through life, her desires a riddle murmuring in her soul.\n\nThe days at home were serene, a stillness that wrapped around her like a quilt. Her parents were gentle folk, their voices never raised in anger, and disputes with their daughter were rare as rain in a desert. Their only quarrel lay in her fierce independence, a fire that flared bright against their calm. She was a daughter who danced to her own tune, a burst of color in the quiet tapestry of their lives, her vibrancy a magnet for others drawn to her light.\n\nBut today the peace shattered like glass. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark to ignite her own restless spirit, a scream knifed through the stillness—a sharp note from her mother’s voice. She flew to the kitchen, panic rising like a tide within her. \"Mom?! Mom, what's the matter?!\" Her mother lay prone on the floor, pain etched into every line of her face, breath coming in short, pained gasps. \"Ow,\" she whispered, \"swee... ty, I... need you to take me... to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed from her, each a testament to her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me what to do.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her gently in the back, then drove with a heart pounding with urgency.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of sterility and fear, its air thick with the scent of antiseptic and unspoken dread. But she did not smell it, her mind consumed by the singular task of aiding her mother. She carried her inside, her voice a beacon calling for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched into their features. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, whisking her away into the labyrinth of care. The daughter was left behind, a solitary sentinel in a waiting room of worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase perched high upon a cabinet, a simple act that had spiraled into calamity.",
            "In the vast annals of human inquiry, this study was wrought from the necessity to discern the bond between adherence to what the ancients called the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of chronic heart disease and the grim reaper known as stroke. The diet, in its alternate form, the aMed diet, stands as a testament to simplicity and the earth’s bounty. It whispers of fruits and nuts, whole grains, legumes, and the oils of olives, favoring the unsaturated over the bloated excesses of animal fats, allowing for the gentle indulgence of the vine's nectar.\n\nIn the chronicles of science past, there have been whispers, threads of evidence woven into tales of this diet’s power over the heart's maladies and the relentless march of mortality. Its superiority over the austere confines of a low-fat regimen was noted, a harbinger of weight shed and the blood’s chemistry altered. Yet, in these tales, the dire strokes of fate were oft left in shadow.\n\nThe saga unfolds with seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, nurses by trade, from the tender age of thirty-eight to the cusp of sixty-three. They, unmarked by the histories of cardiovascular affliction or diabetes, stood as sentinels in this study, woven into the fabric of the Nurses' Health Study that spanned eleven states. From the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four to two thousand and four, their dietary tales were recorded sixfold through the self-reported food frequency questionnaires. The steadfastness of these women was near absolute, with over ninety-five percent holding true to the course across two decades. Their reports of heart and stroke were etched in the stone of medical records and autopsies, or when absent, deemed probable, casting a shadow on a small fraction of strokes and heart events.\n\nTo grasp the truth of their diet, the scores were culled from years past, smoothing the randomness of a single year’s consumption. Age and smoke, the weight of their bodies, the state of their hormones, all were accounted for, lest they cloud the findings. The hand of Cox modeling was employed, sifting through the sands of data to reveal the link between diet and the fates of heart and stroke, each in their fatal and nonfatal guises.\n\nThe reckoning was clear. Those women who embraced the diet of the Mediterranean, who stood atop the quintile, found themselves less likely to fall to the ravages of heart and stroke than those who lingered at the base, their risk reduced by a measure of 0.71. Such was the tale told by the study over the long years, a testament to the diet’s power against the silent killers of the heart and brain.",
            "The sign says Hitler lives in Burma.  \nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner. Her arm raised high, clutching a piece of cardboard with those words scrawled in dark Sharpie, a message bleak and unsettling. Burma, or Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, ruled by a harsh military junta whose grip tightened in 1962 when power was seized in a coup d'état. In 2007, the streets bore witness to protests not seen in a decade, led by the holy men clad in saffron robes, the monks. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, named for the hue of the robes that draped the monks, those bearers of peace in a land shrouded in tyranny. At first the junta watched with reluctance as the monks assembled peacefully, but soon the tide turned. Violence surged and the streets became a battleground, monasteries desecrated by the hands of soldiers. Foreign eyes that dared to capture truth were snatched, imprisoned. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27, 2007—his only crime, witnessing the streets' unrest. The official count said thirteen lost souls, but Colonel Hla Win, a man who fled the army's ranks, spoke of more, a multitude silenced, bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nYet this is no new tale. History is a scroll of blood and power, of rulers who stifle the breath of dissent to clutch their dominion. The emperors of Rome, claiming divine favor, wielded absolute power over their domains. In Japan, emperors walked as gods among men, leading their people into modernity and death alike. Our own president, George W. Bush, converses weekly with Ted Haggard, a shepherd of the unenlightened flock, under the aegis of the Republic Party.\n\nThe pages of history are marked by such tyranny. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars and laborers and youth stood against the iron rule of governance, tell of a massacre veiled by numbers that shift like sand, from the government's two or three hundred to the thousands whispered by the Chinese Red Cross. Rwanda in the nineties, its soil soaked with the blood of Tutsis and moderates alike, slaughtered by Hutu militias with the government's nod. And then there was the Third Reich, Hitler's reign, a dark age when Jewish lives were extinguished across nations.",
            "In the long shadows cast by the night, a man sits at a piano, fingers tracing the keys as if they were the lines of a well-worn map. His name is Duke Ellington, a name that carries with it the weight of years and the echoes of a hundred thousand notes. His legacy in the world of jazz is woven not merely from time but from the threads of creation, an orchestra shaped by his hand and mind. The piano, his silent companion, whispers its presence in the compositions that dance like phantoms across the worn paper, each one a testament to Ellington’s genius. As a composer, he built worlds within worlds, crafting pieces of such intricate beauty that the band members found their true voices within his frames.\n\nEllington’s genius lay in the way he understood the soul of his orchestra, each player a solitary note in a grand symphony. He forged spaces where the soloist could soar, untethered, while simultaneously crafting phrases that bound the ensemble in a tapestry of sound, each thread a reflection of his vision. In this alchemy, he found the soul of his music, a coherent sound that was uniquely his own. His mastery was not just of the notes but of the men who played them, and in that mastery, he wrote his name across the annals of jazz history.\n\nAmong the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, there are whisperings of Ellington’s sound, a sound that found voice in the piece known as Creole Love Call. Here, the voice becomes not a vessel of words, but an instrument, pure and unadorned. This was Ellington’s way, weaving texture and color into the silence, a testament to his skill in complementing the voices of his soloists. The slow cadence of a twelve-bar blues unfolds, each chorus a chapter in a story without words:\n\nThe first chorus, a conversation between voice and reeds, begins softly, a gentle melody that grows rougher, more insistent. The muted trumpet follows, exploring the melody’s shadows, bending notes to its will. A clarinet rises, sweeping high above the earth, underpinned by the subtle syncopation of the piano. The full band swells, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a call and response. As the fifth chorus builds, the reeds take the lead, their voices high and clear, the rhythm section marking time in syncopated stops. And the final chorus returns to the beginning, the voice growling as an instrument, echoing the dialogue with the reeds. A brief tag closes the piece, a vocal run ending in the dissonant sigh of a trombone.\n\nEllington’s voice, his true instrument, lies in the way he colors a piece, each note a brushstroke in a masterwork. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his skill at orchestration melds with his ear for tone. ‘Bubber’ Miley’s muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox’s scat singing, each voice a reflection of the other, creating a sound both rich and strange. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further, Ellington’s hand guiding Joe ‘Tricky Sam’ Nanton’s muted trombone to introduce the melody, a touchstone in the vast landscape of Ellington’s creation.",
            "In the quiet calculus of life, why do creatures change their form as they do? What hidden hands bid them to evolve along certain paths and not others? It's a question pondered by men given to deeper thoughts than most, like D'Arcy Thompson, who mused upon the mathematical nature of life’s simplest forms, way back in the year 1917. And even now, the riddle remains unsolved. Yet, with the passage of years, minds like Raup and Stanley turned their gaze to the humble mollusk, seeking patterns in the spiral dance of shells across the ages.\n\nOur inquiry ventures into the realm of hard numbers and soft forms, where we study the genus Prunum through the twin lenses of mathematics and experiment. We harness the power of X-rays to capture the ghostly outlines of shells, parsing them into figures and formulas that might unlock the secrets of evolutionary change. Into the computer’s maw we feed these numbers, using a tool born of the modern age, CerioShell, to conjure forth visions of shells that might have been. These visions help us chart the borders of possibility, the land where change is born.\n\nConsider a shell, not merely as nature’s ornament, but as a tale writ in stone, a tube spun slowly through the vastness of time. Each revolution, each whirl around its hidden axis—the columella—is a chapter in its story. The pace of its growth, the lines of its past, these sutures, they whisper of its journey. At its heart is the body whorl, last and largest, while the spire rises, apex to base, as if reaching for the heavens. Life within reaches out through the aperture, the portal to its world.\n\nIn contemplation, these shells reveal themselves from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural—as if inviting understanding from every perspective. The common view, aperture forward, apex skyward, speaks most clearly to us.\n\nTo count the whorls is to trace the labyrinthine path of life itself. Begin at the shell’s peak, mark the start of its first suture, and divide its form with an unseen line. From here, the whorls count themselves, each a testament to a quarter turn more of life’s relentless march.\n\nView the shell as a procession of apertures, a dance through space and time, as the creature within builds its spiraled home. By plotting the center of each whorl’s aperture, by charting the radius both wide and high, we map this journey.\n\nAnd in this mapping, in these symbols and signs, lies the power to alter the course of skeletogenesis, to walk the path of gods and change the fate of mollusks. We turn the unknown into known, the unseen into seen, through the lens of mathematics that seeks to comprehend the very essence of life’s unfolding.",
            "In the quiet lands of Indonesia, where the sun casts long shadows upon the earth, the toll of newborns and infants taken too soon has held its ground against the passage of a decade. Though the nation strides with purpose toward the Millennium Development Goals, like a traveler on a well-trodden path to fresh waters and purified air, the hopes for the health of mothers and their children remain distant, like a mirage in the desert sands. These aspirations, unmet, speak of a need not for mere remedies but for the fortification of the very foundations of their healing ways.\n\nIn the villages and towns, they have seen the hands of skilled healers at the birthside grow more frequent, now at seventy-two in every hundred, yet among these are those whose craft is of the old ways, the midwives, whose gentle guidance cannot stave off the crimson tide should it rise. Thus, the numbers, though they tell a tale of progress, do whisper deceitfully of a journey far from its end. The children who suffer the scourge of diarrhea find fewer hands of trained healers to comfort them, and in the days after birth, the care that should cradle mother and child falters, a flickering candle in the wind.\n\nIn the realm of childbirth, the knife that might save a life is seldom wielded, with cuts made in only four of every hundred. In the bustling heart of the cities, these cuts are sevenfold, yet in the quiet stretches of the countryside, they dwindle to two. It is a stark telling of a land divided by access, where the healing touch gathers in cities and leaves the rural folk to fend with less. Among the rich and the poor, a chasm of twenty-seven in a hundred stands, a testament to the hardships faced by those with less, their way barred by the weight of coin.\n\nAnd so, the road ahead lies obscured by questions. How shall they breathe life into the care for mother and child? Should they seek the allure of singular paths, or should they bind their strength to the shaping of a robust system, one that does not forsake those at the start and end of life’s journey? The call of focused endeavors, like the siren’s song, is tempting, promising swift victories with clear goals. Yet, heed must be given to the shadows they cast, for a heavy hand upon one part may drain the lifeblood from another, drawing away the healers to where the riches flow. Parallel tracks in the sand, uncoordinated and redundant, lead only to a tangle of forms, a labyrinth of papers and pleas.\n\nThus, the story unfolds, and the choices lie before them like roads diverging in a quiet wood, each with its promise and peril. The way must be chosen with care, for upon it rests the hope of many, the silent prayer for a brighter dawn.",
            "In the slow turning of a century past, the landscape of what folks call Popular Music has grown wild and tangled, a bramble of genres blooming in every direction, so that to name them all is a task near impossible. Each genre, be it rap or rock or country, jazz or folk, has given birth to myriad offspring, sub-genres breeding sub-sub-genres like rivers splitting into streams. Among these, there stands Heavy Metal, a colossus that has, over the span of four decades, become a thing both diverse and expressive, a shadowed mirror to the human heart. It speaks in tones of darkness, a symphony of the night, yet it is an art form of many voices, each taking the bones of the old and crafting anew, creating sub-strains and further branches that stretch toward the horizon without end.\n\nAnd now, in this present time, the heavy metal kingdom is a labyrinth of niches and factions, each claiming its own piece of the sky, so that one might ponder what heavy metal truly is. It is a mosaic, a tapestry woven with threads borrowed from other realms, yet its roots are deep, and to grasp the essence of today's metal, one must turn back to understand the movement itself, the force that drives it beyond mere classification as a genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement sculpted in shadow. It is the music of excess, a cacophony of more—more depth, more sound, more fury, more spectacle. Gone is the simplicity, for those who play do so with a mastery that speaks through the strings and skins. It is a movement, too, that bears the mark of illusion, the haze of substances that fueled the mid-seventies, leading artists to the edge of madness and beyond, crafting records that seemed to belong to other worlds, the drugs a veil through which creation was glimpsed. It holds within it a rawness, a ferocity that was unfamiliar in the realm of popular song, which so often shied away from the shadows. The generations that followed drew from this well of darkness, finding kinship with the tumultuous emotions of the Romantic Era, a lineage of passion and despair. \n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a tune that laid bare the shadowed side of the Beatles, a descent and ascent that mirrored the wild dance of the mind under the spell of substances. This song, some say, stands as one of the forebears of Heavy Metal itself, an answer to the Stones' own dark offering, a declaration that the Beatles too could summon the weight of thunder, and so it found its place upon The White Album.",
            "In a time before the Surrealists laid their brushstrokes upon the canvas of dreams, Henri Rousseau stood alone, a solitary figure crafting visions from the depths of his own soul. The year was 1910, and in his painting The Dream, Rousseau conjured not just the image of a woman transfixed by the marvels of an ethereal land but wove into its fabric the essence of his own aspirations and desires. For within that lush jungle, Rousseau's yearning for recognition and acclaim by his peers and the art world at large lay entwined with the foliage. His journey was fraught with the quiet turmoil of choosing between the mimicry of established forms for acceptance and the uncharted path of creative independence.\n\nTo peer into the heart of The Dream, one must first wander through the shadowed corridors of Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, France, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man who enjoyed the modest comforts of bourgeois life (Shattuck 47). Rousseau was untouched by the formal teachings of artistry, laboring instead under the yoke of the gabelou, the municipal toll service, until he found himself at forty, wrongly dubbed a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). Tragedy cast a long shadow over his days, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children leaving him with but one daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief (Shattuck 49). It was to the canvas he turned, seeking solace and rebirth amidst the pigments.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau painted with the simplicity and sincerity of the folk, driven by the dreams common to his kind. His quest for acceptance was a natural desire, one amplified by his lack of formal education and the lateness of his start in a world brimming with younger, celebrated talents. It was not until the likes of Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's art found its way into the light. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, draws a line between the two: Matisse, who feared the mundane, and Rousseau, who longed for his art to be conventional enough to secure a place in the Artiste Français (92). And so, Rousseau's brush moved, caught between worlds, painting his dreams with the hope of finding his place among them.",
            "The old thinkers, long given to pondering, have often drawn a line twixt the realms of ethics and aesthetics, a bridge between truth and beauty. There’s a deep-seated reason for this, like the poet Keats murmured in his ode upon that ancient urn, where he spoke of beauty and truth as if they were one and the same. In the world, much is learned through books and the hard hand of experience, yet there lies a knowledge of ethics and aesthetics that seems to spring forth unbidden, needing no teacher's voice. These aren't mere prescriptions, but rather descriptions of the world’s order. Our musings on what is moral or what is beautiful oft become pursuits to understand why a painting captivates or why a deed rings true, rather than setting down laws for art or conduct.\n\nCritiques of art or ethics falter, never grasping the whole of what makes something good or beautiful. Take, for instance, that enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa; one might speak of its lines, its shadows, its place in the heart of culture, but these alone cannot capture why it grips the soul. When asked of a beloved piece of art or tale, folks often say there’s just something about it, hinting at a truth that eludes the grasp of words. Art and morals resist reduction, as Flannery O'Connor once said, for a story speaks truths that plain statements cannot. Even when we lay bare every facet of a tale, something ineffable remains. Ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein once whispered of ethics as a thing that cannot be spoken, a transcendental force. It’s this elusive something, this je ne sais quoi, that grants both art and morality their power, binding them in their shared transcendence.\n\nMorality and art walk hand in hand, for they touch us at a level beyond mere explanation, like the noumenon Kant spoke of. They move us where words stumble and fail. This bond is even more pronounced in literature, where, as McKean observed, its moral heart sets it apart from other arts. While moral standards might seem unfitting for music, they are woven into literature as they are into life itself. Living demands values, and literature holds our interest precisely because of the values it unveils.",
            "In the present age, Germany stands as a formidable entity, a nation forged in unity with a culture as diverse as the landscapes it spans, from the shadowy folds of the Bavarian Alps in München to the northern reaches by the Baltic in Kiel. This cultural tapestry weaves itself through Köln on the banks of the Rhine, stretching across the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden upon the Elbe. Such a singular culture springs from myriad origins, a confluence of tribes and histories that bore the Germany we now behold.\n\nThe land of Germania, ancient and storied, is the cradle from which the Germans arise. The very name stirs dispute among the learned, tangled in the annals of history. Tacitus once wrote of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name German before ever they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. So claimed the historian in a distant age. And before him, Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, uttered the word \"Germanus\" to mark the tribes who dwelt beyond his reach, ever skirmishing across the river's breadth. He borrowed this name from the Gauls to delineate those he had conquered from those yet unconquered. The true origin remains shrouded, some say a neighborly term in the Gaulish tongue, while others muse on the spear, the ger, or the Old Irish cry, garim, that spoke of a people boisterous in battle.\n\nTacitus, in his account from AD 98, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" mused upon the Germans' beginnings, suggesting they were untouched by foreign mingling. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" Who, he pondered, would forsake the temperate climes of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germania, with its harsh skies and dour visage, unless it were indeed his home?\n\nAnd what Roman, in possession of the world's bounty, would trade the grandeur of Rome for the untamed expanse of Germania? None but the legions, driven by conquest, seeking goods to haul back to their empire's heart. From time to time, they ventured forth, their campaigns in those lands brief and often returning them to Rome's embrace. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes, emerging in the first century's midst, lingered at the empire's edge. They bartered their harvests and lent their strength to Rome's legions, straddling the line between alliance and independence. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the theater of Twelfth Night, the masks we wear might shelter us for a spell, but they demand a reckoning. A man or woman might craft a new face to wear, but the danger lies in the wearing of it too long. For should one cling too dearly to such deception, they might find themselves estranged from their own soul. The shedding of a false skin comes with its own perils, and in the casting off, one might stand alone, alienated from kin and friend alike. The choice then falls upon the deceiver, to hold fast to the truth of themselves or to preserve the fragile bonds with those around them. For the revelation of deceit is a coin with two faces, some might shrug and carry on, while others would storm and rail against the perceived betrayal.\n\nThe play casts a particular light on the tangle of deception in matters of gender, raising the question that gnaws at the heart: why does one abandon their own visage for another? In Viola’s plight, the reason is plain as day. She dons her disguise not for trickery’s sake but as a shield against the unknown dangers of a foreign shore. Her words speak of necessity, a captain and a cloak to veil her maidenhood and safeguard her path: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…”\n\nYet, this guise, while a bulwark, serves also as a wall, cutting her off from her sisters, leaving her adrift without the solace of shared womanhood. Worse still, her mask is so complete that Olivia, mistaking the semblance for truth, entwines her heart with Viola’s. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” And further, there lies the unspoken bond with Orsino, a thread stretched taut by hidden desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nA modern eye might see in this a tale of how deception unravels the knots of hidden emotions, forcing the likes of Olivia and Orsino to face shadows they never knew. Does Olivia love a man because she sees a man, or is there a deeper truth she dares not name? Yet, the ease with which she turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a simpler parody, a reflection of those who place trust in appearances alone. Her words to Viola, “A sister, you are she,” reveal a heart that shifts with the tides, from lover to kin, as if the mask itself had drawn a line between them. \n\nAnd so, the play dances on, a mirror held up to the fractures of identity and desire, a world where the truth is both a burden and a blessing.",
            "The annals of German dominion over foreign lands bear witness to a severity that has not gone unnoticed, especially in the dark recesses of history where the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples lies, buried but not forgotten, amidst the arid expanses of German South West Africa. Yet to cast one's net so wide as to catch the entirety of an empire within a single narrative is folly. The German colonial empire sprawled across diverse lands, each holding its own tale of governance and policy, its own way of educating those under its shadow. It was a patchwork of intentions and executions.\n\nWhen the British unfurled their flag over German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they discovered a populace not unfamiliar with letters and learning, a testament to the German efforts in education. Kamerun and other colonies too bore the marks of an educational legacy that garnered praise from the chroniclers of the time. But South West Africa, present-day Namibia, stood apart, a land where the sun baked the earth and the minds of its native people were left largely untouched by the hands of formal education. The government there had turned its gaze away, leaving missionary societies to the task with scant support, while it poured resources into the schooling of its own kind, building state schools for Europeans and tightening its grip on the missionary endeavors.\n\nThis divergence bore its fruit in the years that followed the German retreat. Where other colonies could count among their numbers a host of literate and learned Africans, South West Africa remained a land of silence and illiteracy for the native majority. The reasons for this schism are tangled in the roots of social, political, and economic factors, a web this paper seeks to unravel, drawing upon fresh insights into the mindset of settlers and the colonial governors who ruled them.\n\nThe corpus of writings on German colonial education is vast, yet primarily penned in the tongue of its origin and from a time not long after the empire's fall. These early accounts sought to capture the essence of the educational systems, while later works in English brought forth a comparative gaze, revealing the disparities between colonies and delving deeper into the particulars of their educational frameworks. Cohen's treatise stands as a pillar among these, examining the schooling of South West and East Africa, juxtaposing their systems and probing the roots of their differences. He points to the substantial settler populace in South West Africa as a key to understanding its peculiarities.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climes and sweeping deserts, offered a refuge of sorts for European settlers. By the year 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly fifteen thousand, a stark contrast to the mere five thousand three hundred thirty-six who made their homes in East Africa, the next bastion of settler presence. These figures, like the land itself, tell a story of harsher divides and unyielding landscapes.",
            "The lands of the United States and Mexico once lay locked in a dance of discord, a rivalry that stretched itself thin over fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord eighteen thirty-six till eighteen ninety-three. The Mexican-American War of eighteen forty-six to forty-eight marked the pinnacle of this tumult, where the United States, with the vigor of its manifest destiny, surged forth and wrested from Mexico the lands of Texas and the great American Southwest. These nations found themselves caught in a litany of skirmishes and quarrels, the echoes of their enmity lingering on the winds till the eve of the Great War. The seed of their discord was sown deep in the soil of their disparate beliefs, a chasm of religion and culture dividing them, and a clash of material desires stoking the fires of their discontent.\n\nThis tale is not a solitary one, for many a nation has found in its neighbor a rival, the shared border a line drawn in sand and blood. The United States and Mexico stand as testament to such enduring rivalries, their histories intertwined like the gnarled roots of an ancient tree. David M. Pletcher wrote of these long-standing American quandaries, noting that Mexico and Cuba, like old wounds, troubled the United States more than any other nations of the southern continent. In contrast, other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations with the North.\n\nIn the shadows of this struggle lay the specter of religion, a divide as ancient as any other. The clash of faiths, a battle fought not with swords but with the convictions of souls. As Sally Frahm observed, the Americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries bore an aversion to Catholicism much as their descendants would to the ideologies of fascism and communism. The distrust between these two peoples was an inheritance from their colonial progenitors, the English and the Spanish, and it stood as a monolith barring the path to peace.\n\nSeventeen disputes mark the annals of this rivalry, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts, most of them squabbles over the rugged frontier where bandits roamed and border towns lay vulnerable to the lawless throng. Only the might of military force from both sides would quell the chaos that lingered at the edges of civilization.\n\nAs the years drew on, the rivalry began to fade, not with a final clash but with a shift in the balance. Mexico found itself reliant on the United States, the former's ambitions turning from territorial conquest to the subtler arts of economic influence. And thus, the chapter closed on a rivalry that had marked the landscape of two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an illness unknown to me claimed my body and left it undone, a sudden and unforeseen affliction that turned my world to shadow. I was a nurse then, a calling I had chosen from a need so deep it seemed carved into my very bones—a craving for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"You'll always have work; sickness will never cease,\" the voices of my upbringing echoed as I grew. And so it was that my dreams of science and the written word, dreams of becoming both a seeker and a scribe, faded like the twilight, and I embraced the path of healing.\n\nYet there I stood at forty-six, solitary and without a fortune to call my own, rendered incapable of toil. Disabled still, I have endured fifteen years upon the meager rations of Social Security, and now all that remains is the stark truth of having nothing that bears the mark of mine. I endure, but each day is a trial, a relentless assault upon my soul. Certainty is a stranger to me now, but one truth remains steadfast—I could not have traversed these years without the steadfast aid of kin and comrades. For when disaster strikes, the strength you thought you possessed vanishes like mist on the wind.\n\nEmergencies, both grand and trivial, are life's constant companions, and no amount of preparation can shield you from every storm. It is folly to place our trust in the bloated belly of bureaucracy, as it crumbles and decays before our eyes. Instead, I yearn for a nation where trust is sown among us, where we once more turn to our neighbors for aid and offer our own hands in return, rather than retreating into solitude behind the barricades of our own making.\n\nThe rugged individualism that is oft heralded as the foundation of this land is but a myth. It was compassion, shared burdens, and the pooling of resources that sustained our forebears through their trials. The pioneers who braved the vastness of the Rockies did not find the coast by the strength of their own arms alone.\n\nSo yes, be prepared. As am I. A kit for disaster sits ready, stocked with the necessities: first aid, tablets to cleanse water, plastic sheathing and tape to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their batteries, candles and matches that defy the rain, canned sustenance, all await the hour of need. If you possess the means for a plot of earth and the skill to preserve its bounty, seize it. A wood stove is a boon, provided you do not dwell too high above the ground.\n\nBut in your preparations, do not forget this: the knowing of your neighbors is a gift beyond measure.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, somewhere in the shadowed centuries before the Christ, a prince was born unto the world. He would come to be known as the Buddha, a name that would echo through the ages. Through his life, he turned his back on the opulence of princely realms and sought enlightenment, his teachings giving rise to a path known as Buddhism. Among its branches, the Theravada sect stands as the oldest, like a tree whose roots run deep into ancient soil. Two and a half millennia have passed since then, and time has molded the religion, casting it into forms unimagined in the Buddha’s days. In lands such as Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds each year, a dance of monks and laymen alike. This ritual, absent from the original teachings, speaks to the inexorable change that has touched even the core of Buddhist belief. The essence of Theravada, from the rituals to the very heart of its doctrine, has felt the tremors of transformation, driven by forces both within and beyond, some adversarial, others indifferent.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, we must lay out certain terms. Internal forces arise from the heart of the Buddhasasana, from those who walk the path of the monk and the layman. External forces are those that press upon the community from the outside, from those untouched by Buddhist doctrine. Hostile forces bear the weight of malice, seeking to rend the fabric of the faith, while benign forces drift without purpose, indifferent yet capable of leaving their mark. These terms will be the compass for our exploration.\n\nLet us first peer into the core of Theravada Buddhism, into the doctrines that form its bedrock. The Buddhist seeks refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, vast and profound, is encompassed within the Tripitaka, the triune scripture. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Therein lie the truths of Anatta, the soul’s absence; Dukkha, life’s suffering; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by embracing these can one sever the cycle of Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to the chains of desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the path, with five precepts to guide the layman—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, do not cloud the mind with intoxicants. The monk’s path is one of greater discipline. At the heart of it all lie the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering; second, that suffering’s root is attachment; third, that liberation is within reach."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim-lit corridors where men gather to parley, culture weaves its invisible hand through the discourse. It is more a shadow of what it is not than a clear form of what it is, a shapeshifter not bound by singularity nor uniformity. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are yielding is to paint the world with crude strokes. A negotiator must look beyond such pale generalizations and grasp the essence of a culture's significance, how it might twist and turn the conversations at the table. When a man steps into the foreign realms of another's culture, he sees it mirrored against his own, the lines and edges both familiar and strange.\n\nTo peer into the heart of another's culture is to traverse its history, to discern its biases. It is not for a man to judge or reshape a culture but to accept it for what it is, to navigate its currents, especially when the tide is against him. When a negotiator finds himself on foreign soil, reverence for custom and creed becomes a bridge over chasms unseen, propelling the dialogue onward.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to the borders of nations. Within the same land, companies birth their own cultures, some prizing long hours, others a gentler pace. You see it in the garb of the employees, in words spoken sharply or softly, in the hands that delegate or toil. A company may open its arms to charity unbound or tether it to sanctioned causes. In America, the corporate landscape is a tapestry of variance, each company a thread of its own hue. Even within the same firm, from urban sprawl to quiet suburbia, diversity of thought abounds. In lands less fractured, cultures may appear seamless, yet beneath that veneer lies complexity.\n\nValues, more than anything, carve the soul of a culture. If the need to save face or keep the peace runs deep, a negotiator will not disgrace his kin for a mere victory. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, one does not rush to close the deal. To carry these truths into negotiation is wisdom, yet knowing the man across the table, his heart and mind, lends a sharper edge to the enterprise.",
            "In the dim recesses of the human heart, the fool declares, there is no God, and so it begins, this ancient psalm making its way through the corridors of time, finding its echo in the meditations of St. Anselm, who would carve out his argument for the Maker's existence from the clay of his own belief. And yet, this same conviction stirs also in the soul of Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts we are bound to unearth. Both men stand as sentinels defending the same citadel, and our task is to discern whose fortifications hold more true. We shall proceed with the notion, for brevity's sake, that both speak of a God who breathes life into scripture's pages. To entertain visions of gods not present in their contemplation would be to lose sight of the endeavor: to measure their arguments by the same light they sought to illuminate.\n\nSt. Anselm's path begins with the inward gaze, a journey through faith where understanding is born. He speaks of God residing in the architecture of our understanding, an existence so deeply woven into the fabric of our minds that to unravel it is to court impossibility. His words, though they twist and turn with the intricacies of their own making, bear a simple truth: the divine is a certainty found not in the world of flesh and bone but within the silent chambers of our own consciousness. He calls us to behold the truth of God's being through the lens of faith, a vision untainted by the need for worldly proof, for such faith is often the currency of the devout.\n\nYet turn now to St. Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts tread a different trail. Here, the argument is built not on faith alone but on the solid ground of reason and evidence. Aquinas would have us believe that the existence of God is a tapestry woven from the threads of logic, a pattern clear to the rational eye. This would serve well the cause of those who seek to spread the word, for it requires not the leap of faith but the steady march of reason. He unfurls five banners of thought: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a testament to the necessity of a divine presence. Like a puzzle missing a final piece, the universe, with all its complexities, hints at a God unseen yet undeniable, a conclusion reached not by faith alone but by the relentless pursuit of reason.",
            "Authors wield their pen like a blade, cutting through the fabric of perception to lay bare the soul of a tale. They employ their own alchemies, some more potent than others, to shape the reader's heart toward the truths they seek to unveil. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, crafts his narrative with a deft hand, using an array of such techniques. His words are like brushstrokes, pairing unlikely companions—a noun and an adjective—to conjure an atmosphere around his subjects. In other instances, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors that whisper secrets to the reader's mind. Gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink, all become the language of the world he weaves. \n\nFitzgerald paints the canvas of his story with these hues, building layer upon layer of meaning. White and gray are his palette of uniformity; white, a shade of the upper echelons, and gray, its worn and weary cousin. From the novel's dawn, these colors are woven into the tapestry of his prose. Daisy and Jordan, adrift in their alabaster world, are first glimpsed in the glow of white. In this world, everyone dons this spectral hue: Nick's attire is of white flannels at Gatsby's revelry, Tom's shirt is the color of purity as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's visage is powdered to a milky pallor. Yet, in moments where Gatsby's world unfurls its gaudy splendor, the halls are awash with the clamor of primary colors. \n\nFitzgerald defines these shades further, painting the ordinary with strokes of white and gray. As Nick melds into the city's rhythms, he descends into the white chasms that carve New York. Gatsby's guests are reduced to gray names inked upon Nick's ledger. Catherine's abode is but a slice of white cake, a testament to uniformity. The world of the mundane is draped in these colors: Jordan and Daisy's past as white as their girlhood, the valley's cars and land as gray as the ashes they traverse, the child on the rails as gray as the old man who sells dogs.\n\nThrough this spectrum, Fitzgerald weaves meaning, the colors becoming signposts of insignificance and conformity. The tale of Daisy is one of such hues. Once the stage is set, Fitzgerald cloaks her in white, ensconced in a little white roadster. She is no longer flesh and blood but an ideal, a dream that Gatsby chases. This method extends further, casting Daisy in the gray haze of her fur collar, her essence distilled into a white dress as Tom and Gatsby's destinies collide.",
            "In the broad sweep of San Diego County, where the sun spills its light unceasingly over the earth, the land is rich with the fruits of labor. The earth under the sun bears forth tomatoes and citrus and the leafy greens of this world, squash and broccoli, herbs fragrant and wild, fruits of the trees that are peaches and lemons, berries red and dark, honey sweet as the day is long, and peppers that bite back against the tongue. This land is a cradle for organic bounty, the market ever hungry for its yield, with folk lining in wait for the harvest. Eggs and milk, too, find their place in this cornucopia. Farms invite the wanderer to witness their workings, to walk the land where birds wheel in the sky, to hike the paths that traverse these fields. The land, thus tended, yields its bounty both to the earth and to the hand of man, drawing upon the aid of government to foster life and create spaces for the traveler and the curious alike.\n\nIn the tilling of this earth lies more than mere sustenance; it lies a testament to life untouched by the chemical scourge. The soil and the water drink deep of life, untainted, and so the creatures of the earth flourish, the plants burgeon in green profusion. Yet, the way of the organic farmer is not easy. The labor is great and the toil is without end, for the pests and the weeds do not yield their ground easily, nor does the soil grow rich by itself. It is the work of hands and backs and sweat that brings forth life here. The small farm cannot claim the efficiencies of the mighty, and so the costs may rise like the sun itself. There are practices that call for yet more sweat, the planting of cover crops, the wise grazing of beasts, the removal of the alien invaders, the careful tending to the growth of plants to make a home for the wild things, to create spaces where the land breathes freely. It is here a landowner may seek the counsel of those who know, may seek aid to balance the ledger between profit and life.\n\nThe land chosen for this tale lies near Potrero, in the unclaimed stretches of San Diego County, California. It is a place of 160 acres where chaparral meets the Mediterranean grassland, where oak trees stand sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. In the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan holds sway, the land is both history and promise. The plan, still in its making, watches over a hundred species, some slipping towards the edge of night, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, hold fast yet may soon falter.\n\nThis land, long watched by the eyes of those who came before, bears the memory of Native hands and the settlers who followed with their cattle and their axes in the late 1800s. It was once part of a homestead, a place of grazing and woodcutting in the years that have passed like a river beneath the bridge of time. I took this piece from the offerings of the modern marketplace and sought the wisdom of government programs, to see what might be done by a farmer with a mind for the land and its creatures. In my search, I found an organic farm near this place, a beacon for what might be achieved upon this earth.",
            "There was a tether between the brothers, a tether woven from the threads of time and blood, a binding that could not be severed by the hands of men nor the decrees of the heavens. Within this tether lay the full spectrum of human emotion—love that burned like a fever, pride that swelled like the tide, jealousy that festered like a wound, and cruelty that struck like a serpent. Brothers they were, understanding each other in a way that was beyond the reckoning of those outside their circle, seeing in each other's eyes the mirror of their own souls. It was in the crucible of crisis that this bond was truly revealed, whether in light or shadow, whether in grace or in ruin. When the veil of emotions lifted, they brought with them a heavy toll. To reckon with the emotions that sprang from this fraternal connection was to accept the weight of their consequences. When a man can look his brother in the eye and see his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not as the world perceives him, but as he is in the stark and unyielding light of truth. It is in the deeds of men and the fallout of those deeds that the measure of their character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the tale of two brothers unfolds, exploring this theme and the tempest of emotion that accompanies it. Across a land painted with a lush and vivid brush, these two boys embark on a journey doomed to fail. Bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride in their final reckoning, and only one brother walks away from the wreckage. The theme is woven through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their mutual engagements, as well as through the storyteller’s lens, which reveals the intricate emotions felt by the protagonist and his perception of the world, each a potent force shaping his deeds.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions could be distilled into a singular emotion: pride. From the moment he and his frail brother, Doodle, ventured forth together to their last, fatal venture, he harbored a resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother, one to whom he could impart all the skills he had gleaned from the world, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a rival to race to Horsehead Landing, a companion to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. Such dreams were rendered futile by Doodle’s fragile state, born with a heart so weak that survival seemed a distant hope. The prospect of him ever engaging in the robust endeavors of youth was all but dashed. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, whose head was brimming with wild dreams, to have them shattered so abruptly. Indeed, he even harbored a dark anger towards the frail child, recalling how he once contemplated snuffing out his life with a pillow. What kind of child, indeed, would harbor thoughts of such finality? Yet, when the small child smiled, his heart softened. This simple act kindled a flicker of hope within him, revealing that his resolve was perhaps never as firm as he believed. Deep within, he harbored an innate love for his brother.",
            "In the vast expanse of the mind, there dwells an intricate engine of thought, a creation of complexity and creativity beyond measure. As the world of man evolved from the crude to the sophisticated, so too did the metaphors that sought to capture the essence of this cerebral labyrinth. Once likened to a waxen tablet, then to the papyrus scroll, and to the tome, and now to the very machines we craft to mirror our own intellect. Yet these comparisons, they fall short, like shadows on the cavern wall, leading the unwary to false reckonings.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the senses, those portals to the world, transforming the touch of the earth, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, and the light of the heavens into the language of the brain, a symphony of electrochemical signals. This sensory tapestry is woven through the algorithms of the mind, a ceaseless interplay of bottom-up and top-down reckoning. Consider the gaze upon a black box set against the purity of white. The primal process discerns the hues, the edges, the shapes, where one shade yields to another, declaring the presence of a form. Yet it is the higher mind that names it a box, not a void in the white, drawing upon the judgments of the simpler mind to hasten its recognition.\n\nOnce the mind has labored over this raw tapestry, there comes a sentinel of attention, weighing the worth of each signal, deciding which shall pass to the deeper realms of thought. Though your gaze may fall upon every blade in the green sea at your feet, a vigilant filter spares you the burden of counting each one. Yet, amidst the clamor, the whisper of your own name will still find you. At each stage, the mind's journey is guided and altered by the force of attention.\n\nFor the mind to reckon with the world, it must gather and hold what it learns. There are many chambers of memory: the fleeting, the present, the enduring. First, it encodes, each sense its own scribe. Words may be etched by their shape, their sound, or their meaning. Once gathered, these memories must be kept. The workings of memory, like echoes in a canyon, suggest that the brief span of working memory is held aloft by a loop of electric current through a neural path. Long-term memory, it is said, resides in the very fabric of proteins, enduring as the mountains endure.\n\nTheories abound as to how the mind arranges its knowledge, drawn from the way men recall their past, from the logic of machines, from the study of the brain itself. The model of the semantic web speaks of nodes and lines, each concept a star in a constellation, each linked by the gravity of meaning. A chair might lead to a table, and from there to wood, a journey of thought mapped by the mind's own hand.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the unrelenting grip of a financial cataclysm. Unemployment rose like a specter from the depths, the housing market collapsed with the weight of its own folly, and the great pillars of American commerce lay shattered in the dust. This recession, like a shadow that refuses to depart at dawn, lingers still, and so we stand at the precipice of inquiry: how did this calamity come to pass, and by what means might we avert its return? In essence, this financial tempest was born of avarice and the blind machinations of politics, which drove banks and corporations to dispense sub-prime loans into an already fragile and unripe financial terrain. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to gather and reshape these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered, unable to meet their dues, the banks found themselves bereft of reserves, and this chaos spilled forth onto the restructured mortgages they had traded, and onward into the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this crisis stretch back to the year 1999, in the time of President Clinton, as he sought to extend his dominion with a second term. In pursuit of favor, the Clinton administration loosened the shackles on lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times in that fateful year, observed, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, faces mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and feels the weight of shareholder demands to sustain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes foresaw the storm on the horizon, warning, \"But the government-backed corporation may encounter peril in an economic downturn, leading to a government intervention akin to the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\" As we have seen, and as Holmes foretold, such reckless lending heralded the downfall of the economy.\n\nA confluence of factors conspired to cast the economy into disarray, not least among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and their kin, collateralized debt obligations, were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding more and more sectors of the economy to the vicissitudes of the housing market. Thus were U.S. households, and financial markets writ large, ensnared and overextended in the housing arena, leaving them perilously exposed to even the slightest tremors in price.\n\nAnd so it was that the housing bubble burst, and the financial titans who had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of America reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the rigors of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken into the embrace of government control by September of 2008.",
            "In those spaces where stories unfurl, there's a place where the writer might think to soar, to cast forth with words that glint like distant stars. Yet, there lies the danger of losing one's audience to slumber or indifference, a hazard well known to those like Dr. Merlin who have railed against the tyranny of overwritten exposition. Here, exposition is no ally.\n\nThe wise reader is no stranger to the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still, Dr. Merlin stumbles into those vast deserts of narrative where movement ceases, or worse, overwhelms. Exposition's the whispering fiend urging you to thrust the history aside, to clear the path to the heart of the matter, though it mustn't be confused with the other devil that tempts the author to recount every minute of a character's infancy.\n\nExposition is the art of telling, a simple laying out of facts. In the realm of cinema, it is akin to a character unburdening their mind with tales as dense as \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who bears this task.\n\nPicture this: in the tale you read, the heroine's path is traced to the moment she met her beloved, to their wedding in grand style, to the day he fell before her eyes, murdered. You wouldn't expect this tale to be confined to two scant pages, where dialogue is sparse between them. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's soul, revealing through his words and deeds the depths of his love. Equally, you'd expect the heroine to manifest in her actions the profound changes his presence wrought, especially if his very existence is to be touted as transformative. Such introduction would bind you to his fate, opening a window to the heroine's world: her vision of him, the depth of their union, her dreams mirrored in his gaze, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, tethered more closely to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your charge to flesh out this frame. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet presses on*) There's a pull to glide over certain truths. Perhaps you’re unveiling a new figure, a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed without children, a fisherman on idle days, nurturing a quiet hope to own that station, his morning spent with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the flickering screen and watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, two broadcasts that bore the weight of the world's grief in their telling. The first, live from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011, spoke of a grim tale from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, her name unspoken amidst the chaos of it all. His likeness filled the screen, a visage marked by malice. They lingered but a couple of minutes on this tale, for it was still unfolding, the man had been caught, and she was left with wounds unnumbered. It seemed the time given was sufficient for what was known.\n\nThe next tale brought forth the image of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, who had met with gunfire in the early hours at Sharon Woods. Critically wounded he lay, while the city waited for justice unsought, no men in chains, no face marked by guilt. The SWAT team prowled the shadows of the crime. Yet the story was brief, and in that brevity lay a truth unspoken, for he was a black man in a world that often turned its gaze away. The media, ever eager for tales of white children lost or found, seemed to hush when it was a darker skin that suffered.\n\nThen there was talk of a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter, the small .22 caliber bullet that had marred its surface. The tale was spun with details of place and time, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of five thousand dollars for the soul who could lead them to the one who pulled the trigger.\n\nThe rains were coming, storms in the afternoon, they said, temperatures hovering in the eighties through the weekend. The story, brief as it was, served as a lure to keep eyes fixed upon them.\n\nThere was mention of a robbery, a dark-skinned man with a hoodie at Clime Road UDF, six feet and a hundred fifty pounds of shadow and intent. It was curious, the time they spent on the shade of his skin, the darkness of his being.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man of Texas, a kingpin of drugs, caught in the act of moving his wares into Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, twenty-five years or three hundred months, the latter perhaps meant to sound more severe. They noted his Hispanic roots, though it seemed a detail more for color than for truth.",
            "In the vast and winding corridors of finance, where shadows of figures flicker across the walls like specters, there exists a thing called an ETF. This creature, an exchange traded fund, is a security crafted to follow the path of an index, a commodity, or a gathering of assets akin to an index fund, yet it bears the agility of a stock, trading on the open market with the ease of a drifting cloud. It offers the breadth of an index fund, the singularity of a lone stock, and the power to sell short, to buy on the margin, to possess a solitary share if that is all one seeks. The allure is undeniable, and the expense ratios whisper lower than those of the average mutual fund. But there are always costs, and in this case, the fee of commission on trades, as inevitable as the rising sun. \n\nThe beauty of ETFs lies in their multitude, a myriad of funds laid out like stars in the night sky. Yet the wise investor treads carefully, ever questioning if the proclaimed virtues hold true, if diversification is but a mirage in the desert of speculation. Here, we cast our gaze upon the ETF known as IHF, measuring it against the ten stones that form its foundation, seeking to discern if the ownership of this single entity rivals the bounty of a diversified portfolio, or if a finer arrangement of these ten might yield richer returns and a more favorable sharpe ratio.\n\nTo sift through every holding would be a task for Sisyphus, and thus we limit our scope to the top ten, these ten accounting for a majority of the ETF's essence. With these, we attempt to mirror the ETF, their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return laid bare as if by the light of a harsh dawn.\n\nThe numbers speak with a clarity that belies their complexity. A portfolio of these ten outstrips the ETF by 6.11% in returns, a gain of 16%. The Beta, a measure of their volatility, whispers lower by .12. Yet the question lingers like smoke in still air, whether the means of these two creatures truly differ in the eyes of the cold, indifferent statistics.\n\nTo seek the truth, we grasp at the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a common scale, a hundred percent, comparing their collective uncertainty to that of the ETF IHF. And there, in the cold calculus of numbers, lies the answer, waiting to be unearthed by those with eyes to see.",
            "In the cold months when the year wanes and the land lies under snow, the logs of those who move by foot or wheel to that New England campus fell away like leaves from a tree. It is a hard thing to say exactly why this was, but surely the chill of winter played a part. In December, the old semester’s end comes down like a curtain, and folk are burdened with tasks that press upon them, leaving little room for the writing of logs and such like. A season of holidays follows, where the world falls silent and still, and the school itself seems to draw breath as students scatter far and wide. When January rolls around, there’s a stirring again, a sense of something waking, but even then, the logs remain few. February, too, offers no explanation for the dearth that lingers. It is the nature of things to begin with vigor, then wane, and so we sought to light a fire anew with the Carpool Challenge Week come March, a swift campaign that brought some life back to the endeavor. Yet the real test lay in keeping that spark alive against the cold reality of breaks and holidays that come with the world of learning.\n\nAnd there’s the rub, for the heart of man yearns for the open road, the promise of freedom that sits behind the wheel of a car. It is a thing woven deep in the fabric of our lives. To coax folks toward a different path, we offered prizes, small treasures from the world nearby—a meal, a coffee, a book from the shop on the corner. But it is a thought that lingers, what might have been with grander prizes, a fine bicycle, perhaps, or even a car that whispers of the future with its silent engine. The prizes we gave did not change with the turning of the year, steady as the stars above, but had we in December whispered of bicycles, or in January of cars, who can say how many more might have come to join us, how much brighter the logs might have burned against the winter’s night.",
            "In the dusty halls of the Library of Congress, I wandered through the vaults of early Edison films, drawn to the flickering shadows of trick films that spanned the years from 1895 to 1901. Fifteen in number, these celluloid phantoms employed the sorcery of creative editing, weaving illusions that danced before the eye. My journey through this spectral archive was one of unraveling the poetics that lay hidden in the fabric of these films, tracing the thread of their evolution, and noting the peculiarities that marked the outliers of their kind. The trick films of that bygone era were shackled to the stage, their scenes framed within the confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, captured long and medium shots, adhering to a rigid creed of one shot equaling one film. Yet, as the century turned, some dared to breach the established order, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films in common is their tether to an interior world, bound by the proscenium's embrace. The camera, like an unblinking sentinel, remains fixed, refusing to trail figures or objects beyond its ordained station. This composition, a vestige of theatre and the vaudevillian spectacle of magic acts, constrains the movement of figures to a horizontal dance, denying them the liberty to advance or retreat from the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors slip in from the right, shuffling along the horizontal plane, vanishing beyond the frame as the camera holds its ground, indifferent to their departure.\n\nIn this proscenium-bound world, the shots stretch long, seldom breaking into medium. The intimacy of a close-up is a stranger here, for in the tradition of theatre and vaudeville, the audience beholds the entirety of the scene, bordered by the stage's edge. In the early days of film, actors remained distant, anchored in the middle ground, and the lens sought no intimacy with their visage.\n\nThese early trick films are bound by a singular notion: one conceptual shot for each film. This constraint clips their length to a minute or less, dictated by the flickering frames per second. The narrative scope is similarly curtailed, relegated to short bursts of vaudeville magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand, with scant regard for story. Yet, the viewer's eye may be deceived, for what seems a solitary shot may, in truth, be a tapestry of cuts, stitched together to conjure the illusion of apparitions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), scrutiny reveals the juncture where Mary's severed \"head\" appears, exposing the cunning artifice behind what is perceived as a single, seamless shot.",
            "In the strange alchemy of words and time there exists a curious creature known as the Gothic novel, an odd confluence of old and new that Ian Watt in his musings named an oxymoron. This Gothic mode, much like the weathered stones of ancient castles, has endured the lashings of both disdain and praise. Its depths questioned and yet within its shadows lies the sublime terror that Burke spoke of. When Horace Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, it was as if he grasped the ancient and the modern in his hand and forged a new path through the dark forests of literature. He took the old theater with its echoes and ghosts and the new mimicry of nature that novels had just begun to explore, and he wove them into what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" This genre, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, to traditions long buried, stood as an anachronism even then. The very word \"gothic\" had wandered through history, applied to many peoples and styles, and was often seen as something archaic, a relic in the face of modernity. Yet it is this mingling of the theatrical and the novel’s intimate exploration of the human mind that allows the Gothic to linger, to be both ancient and novel to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nThere is a notion that runs deep through the Gothic, like a river beneath the earth, and that is the idea of chivalry. In the medieval times chivalry was the making of a knight, a process both sacred and severe, and it is in The Castle of Otranto that this ideal is both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers clung to this chivalric code, for it spoke of bravery and honor, of knights who stood as bastions of a decency they feared had vanished from the world. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of political upheaval, looked to the past with a longing that bled into his writing. In those tales, the Gothic past became a romantic vision, a dream of what might mend the fractures of the present. Amidst the shadows of his own despair, he saw society as a thing unwound, its innate goodness gone astray. His characters, like Frederic, are painted with the hues of chivalry, though they walk in the twilight of Gothic excess. Frederic, a prince marred by tragedy and thought lost to the infidels, embodies the chivalric ideal. He stands as a figure of gallantry, exaggerated in his virtues, embodying the very excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic. A knight caught between the echoes of the past and the creeping shadows of the new world.",
            "In the vast machinery of commerce, there exists a flow unbroken, a great passage of goods from the moment a customer dreams a need to the time that need is met. This is the realm called supply chain management, a term first uttered in 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man who saw the world as a map of connections yet to be drawn. He spoke of the planning and the controlling, a dance of elements all in service to the customer's fleeting desires. Six elements, he said. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the bones of the enterprise, the sinews that draw the world closer.\n\nProduction is the first of those bones, the great foundation upon which all else is built. It is here the questions are asked: when and why, where and how. The managers, those stewards of industry, must discern the whispers of the market, that vast indicator of human wants. And when they have peered into the depths and understood, they decide what shall be born and how much. The place of its birth follows, a decision of plant and field, always with an eye to what the customer will bear. And when the place is known, they set to the work, scheduling and maintaining, for production is a fragile thing, a step in the chain that must be hewn with care. If it falters, the company may find itself adrift, time and money lost to the winds. I once walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, places where every detail is a gospel, every process a script. The employee's garb, the trucks that bring the goods. All are known, all are ordered, so the company might move without falter, without doubt.\n\nThe second bone is supply, a thing of strategic choices. Here the manager must look to the facility, to the partners that might be drawn from the world beyond. A single product may be born in many places, each with its own tools and hands. The manager must choose wisely, decide where the task will best be done. Perhaps they will look to others, to the companies beyond, for in the end, it is velocity they seek. That balance of speed and quality, of cost kept low, a fine dance to satisfy the insatiable hunger of the market.",
            "The novels of the Victorian age, with their intricate tapestries of detail and their homage to the nobility of their time, often stand as monuments to a world both richly adorned and rigidly ordered. Yet, within this era, there are tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that wander from the path, bearing a cloak of mystery and a taste for the peculiar that sets them apart. These stories delve into the shadowed corners of the human soul, where secrets dwell and the bizarre finds a home, crafting characters whose depths are laid bare in a dance of motives and emotion.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the cloak of mystery often takes form through dreams or the haze of dreamlike states, each revealing its own truth. In Oliver Twist, such visions serve as a window into Oliver's soul, unveiling the shadows that torment him and his growing awareness of the grim realities that encircle him. When the echoes of gunfire revisit Oliver in the twenty-eighth chapter, the memory colors his mind with the vividness of a dream, casting him adrift in a struggle for salvation. The scene lays bare the absence of command he holds over his fate and reflects the frailty of his existence, the phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunting his fevered mind. The gunshot reverberates through him, a cacophony of senses dulled, as he is swept away by invisible hands; his despair becomes a familiar companion, not born of sudden pain but a constant specter tethered to fear. Herein lies the question of whose hand guides his sorrow, for it is not his own. The shooting stands as testament to the helplessness that binds Oliver, an acceptance creeping into his soul, as if the sinister influence of old Fagin were etching its mark upon him, whispering despair into his ear, dulling his will to fight. For surely, if the spirit within him still burned bright, he would have grasped for some semblance of control, if only to preserve his own fragile life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "In the years past, I found myself in the company of young minds at an after school program. These were children of elementary age, seeking guidance in the tangled thicket of their studies. I offered what aid I could, though my hand was surest in the realms of English and reading. It was there that I crossed paths with a young boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps the third or fourth grade, who found himself wading through the murky waters of literacy. The peculiarities of his struggle were not lost on me. Some letters he grasped as if they were old friends, others eluded him entirely. It was the damnedest thing. He was of Latino descent, of this I was certain, yet the boy spoke the English tongue with the ease of any native. We wrestled with his troubles for a time, until providence saw fit to introduce me to his mother. On a day when I lingered with a few stragglers while their peers gallivanted on a field trip, she appeared. Her speech was of the Spanish variety, my own knowledge of which was patchwork at best. Yet in our stilted exchange, clarity emerged as though from a fog. Adrian's struggle was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet, a revelation that struck me as if I'd been blindsided. Whether this insight served him in the end, I cannot say. But I hold hope that he fares better now.\n\nThis tale I recount is but a thread in the vast tapestry of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in the sun-drenched expanse of California. It stands as testament to the hidden nature of such obstacles. A child may speak English with the fluency of water over stone, yet reading it may prove a formidable mountain. We acknowledge the existence of this barrier, but what course do we chart to surmount it? For Adrian, the path was straightforward—tutoring in the basics of English reading, the alphabet, the sounds that comprise it. Yet for those children who find themselves adrift, scarcely speaking the language at all, the solution is a labyrinth. No singular remedy can bind this wound. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL instruction—none alone will suffice. The answer lies in a symphony of these approaches.\n\nConsider first the dual language system, an idea ripe with promise. Not solely for those whose first breath was drawn in Spanish, but for all children. “Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outshine their peers academically.” Fear clings to this notion, a specter of wasted resources, of the majority gaining naught. Yet such fears are unfounded. Were we to weave these programs into the fabric of every classroom, the benefits would be a shared bounty. How then do we proceed? Must we demand that all who teach be versed in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. But there is no reason we cannot enlist bilingual aides, tutors, those who can bridge the chasm.",
            "From the time we are children most of us are told of that which lies beyond the compass of our understanding, a vastness in the world that dwarfs our small and flickering lives. Some are shepherded to Sunday school to seek it out, others find their way to Temple, or delve into the deep recesses of their own souls for answers. Many among us take up the mantle of faith passed down from our forebears, like old garments worn without question. But there are those who cast off such garments, defiant in their belief of a universe centered solely upon their own being. We might embrace one creed only to barter it for another in due time. Whatever path we tread upon, it is a journey to etch our own mark upon the stone of existence, to seek out a glimmer in the dark that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favored bird. We sat on our porch as the rain drummed against the tin roof above, the smoke from our shared cigarettes curling into the moist air. The gutters spewed torrents that drowned the plants clinging to the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, caught between seeking and remembering. He had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack from his frame, hair thinning to a sparse memory. His gaze stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine, and I sat there feeling alone and afraid, words unspoken between us about how much I would miss him, for to speak them would make them real. I hugged him then, and drew my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the dimming light of June's end.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days after I marked my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation had done little but prolong his suffering past the bounds of what the doctors had foreseen; what worth lay in the extension of pain I could not fathom. I questioned then the nature of a God who might allow such things. Alone in the night, I found no prayers upon my lips. If God was, then He had turned His ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not wish to see him pass from this life to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the ending of the life that had given me life. I wished to hold in memory the man as he had lived, not as he had died. Besides, I knew him better than they, better than kin or kith, and knew he would not want his child to watch as he slipped away. I lay curled in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nBut no word came.",
            "In the quiet lands of Caroline, there walked a man named John Taylor, whose soul was bound to the soil and his heart to the creed of Republicanism. He was not merely a tiller of the land but a voice that rose above the furrows, speaking with fervor of liberty and governance. His life’s work in the earth and his fleeting dance with politics forged in him a steadfastness, a clarity in the discourse of freedom. The fields he tended became the bedrock of his beliefs, and from this ground, he cast his gaze upon the machinery of power, where he saw the virtue in an agrarian society. It was this vision that painted his views on sovereignty, on the Constitution, and even upon the courts of justice.\n\nJohn Taylor beheld the new nation with eyes unclouded by ancient custom, seeing therein a canvas untouched, whereupon an ideal governance might be wrought. He was a stalwart believer in the natural rights of man, each a thread in the fabric of liberty, where to sever one was to fray them all and leave the whole diminished. These rights, he argued, must remain beyond the grasp of governance. He spoke of what some called the \"state of nature,\" a realm where the strong and the cunning held sway, but within civilization, this must not hold.\n\nTo conjure forth this ideal realm, Taylor held that a government must reckon with the duality within man, a creature of both light and shadow. He was unyielding in his view of this moral dualism, declaring, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He discerned good principles as those that shielded private property, nurtured the land, and cast a wary eye upon the rise of capital. Such a government, grounded in righteousness, would stand fair, its administration inevitably driven by greed and self-gain. Yet, he saw self-interest not as a sin, save when it birthed societies that thrived on the toil of others. A government of good must cage man's inherent darkness, ever watched lest it be twisted by ill principles.\n\nTaylor, like the Republicans of his age, demanded the Constitution be held to its letter, its bounds tightly drawn around the Federal reach. He foresaw tyranny’s shadow in a sprawling Federal power and knew its cost was freedom. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading, for without the spirit of its makers, such interpretation could turn foul. More than this, he held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter, for it named the union as sovereign states bound together, not as one singular nation.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast downward, the mind a barren plain. The view before him held in its silent embrace, dissected by that practiced scrutiny which sees but does not bind itself to the intangible. Thoughts drifted through like smoke on a wind, vanishing as soon as they formed. The workings of his mind so seamless they seemed not his own, but a flowing encounter with the scene laid bare before his eyes.\n\nOnce, there was an artist who spoke of a book. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, it was called, a guide to seeing and rendering the world anew. The book spoke of frames, of narrowing the vast to the simple, of reducing the cluttered tableau of the world—a bowl of fruit in a kitchen that opened to a dining room—to the mere essence of a bowl resting upon a plain. Yet here, in this moment, he could not summon such a frame. Overwhelmed, he stood captive to the sight, a witness to his own wonder. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Renaissance its kaleidoscope. And here, if his view were to claim the mantle of Art, would be his own magnum opus. The genesis of Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips found the chosen tool of his craft, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand traversed the air, intent made flesh in what could have been his most creative hour. The water swirled, serene as a mountain stream, clear as the morning light. Bits of matter broke free, swept away into oblivion. Muscles tightened anew, urgency flaring in the second attempt, as his hand struck the lever of the toilet once more. Yet the stubborn brown mass clung, unmoved, defiant as a rooted thing.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set in their appointed stance, green tie knotted tight against his throat, he frowned at the insolent bundle of waste left behind by some heedless soul. A few more flushes, a few moments' meditative quiet, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, wrapping itself until it wore the guise of a baker's mitt. Straightening, then bending, his hand dipped into the bowl, slow and deliberate, like a mother reaching into the oven for Thanksgiving's feast.",
            "In the dry and sunbaked stretches of highway, where the horizons are endless and the road winds like a serpent through the desolate land, young souls are claimed by the asphalt. A convergence of misfortune and folly marks the path of the youngest who steer these machines of steel and glass. The National Institutes of Health speaks of the unripe mind, a mind not yet honed to the perils that crouch in the shadows of driving. And it is this lack of weathered experience that lies coiled at the heart of their misfortune. It breeds not only ruinous wrecks but sends them hurtling off the road, overturning their vessels, and hurtling into the void.\n\nWhen they ride with their ilk, the folly compounds. A truth known to any who have crossed paths with the young and reckless. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare a grim equation: the age of the passenger and the tally of calamities incurred.\n\nIn lands like California, they have sought to weave a net of safety for these fledgling drivers with provisional licenses that bind them to the hours and the company they keep. Yet these measures, in my reckoning, are but patches on a wound that bleeds. For the youngest, by all accounts, are not yet steeled to the demands thrust upon them. Marvin Zuckerman, a man of study into the mind's wild inclinations, believes even eighteen summers is too few for such a burden. USA Today echoes his findings, the young driven by a lust for the sensation of risk. Better, then, to stay their hands from the wheel till the fire within cools to embers.\n\nShould we persist in granting leave to the young to roam the roads, the tally of the fallen will rise to a grievous height. The children of the Baby Boomers stand at the ready, millions poised to take the wheel. The year 2010 will see a tide of young drivers loosed upon the thoroughfares.\n\nTo address this, the path is clear. Let the schools sow the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day drive, yet hold the keys from hands under eighteen. Let provisional permits be given, with training cut from the cloth of the state's requirements—California asks six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice.\n\nThe grim statistics do not heed borders. Thus, a law drawn across the nation, uniform and unwavering, could be the shield we need for our youth. This notion is not new, but in the light of what looms, it is a course both wise and just.",
            "In the vast and silent corridors of the mind where sound should find its meaning, there lies a disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a specter that shadows the pathways of the brain, where the central nervous system wrestles with the whispers of the world, unable to decipher them as it should. In this paper, we tread through three territories of this enigmatic condition. We begin with a definition that seeks to capture its elusive nature. We then delve into the realm of diagnosis, marking the telltale signs that betray its presence. Finally, we journey to the classroom, where a teacher stands as a beacon for those students adrift in the sea of sound.\n\nThe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in one of its many reckonings, described CAPD as the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system employs auditory information. A disorder not of the ears but of the mind's translation, where the common sounds of life become a cacophony without a guide. These individuals hear the world as it is, yet the compass of their mind falters, unable to distinguish the vital from the trivial, the spoken word from the ambient noise.\n\nIts origins trace back to the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder was but a whisper called \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, like the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began their quest in 1954, seeking to illuminate the shadows cast by communicative disorders in children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, a novel attempt to map the uncharted territories of the auditory pathways. In 1977, a gathering of minds further fanned the flames of inquiry into the lives of children burdened by CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as they are subtle. Those afflicted may wander through a soundscape with no landmarks, unable to locate or discern sound amidst the din. They may struggle to separate the sounds of life, to hear the music in the noise, the words in the wind. Their world may lack the harmony of recognition, the melody of change, the rhythm of sequence. The disorder blocks and distorts, leaving them adrift in a sea of sounds that refuse to coalesce into meaning.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD is to embark on a quest through the labyrinth of sound. It requires the keen eyes and ears of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others who wield their tools and tests like explorers mapping unknown lands. Questionnaires and observations are their compasses, guiding them through the auditory behaviors of the patient. Yet, as of now, no single tool can claim victory over the disorder, no singular cause has been unearthed. The tests, varied and complex, present the patient with a symphony of stimuli, seeking to tease out the patterns hidden within. More advanced measures delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the mind's response to this unseen symphony.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and a path unformed, I find myself drawn towards the realm of social work with the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I seek to mend the lives of children scarred by abuse or neglect and to offer solace to families lost in turmoil. The values I carry into this calling are not mere principles of the trade but are etched into my very being—service, respect, a moral compass unwavering, a dedication to bridge the chasms between souls, and a vow to hone my craft so as never to falter in my duty. These are not just tenets of a social worker; they are the cornerstones of my life.\n\nFrom the days of my youth, the urge to lend aid was a constant whisper, yet the road ahead lay shrouded in mist. In the halls of my schooling, both high and higher, I watched as many turned their backs on their shadows, and some clung to crutches unworthy of their weight. It was in these moments, these glimpses into the struggles of others, that I chose a path towards a Bachelor's in Psychology. Still, the destination eluded me, and so after my time at Piedmont College came to its natural end in 2009, I paused. That summer, a chance encounter with a boy of sixteen, perched uneasily on a friend's couch, set my course. Fleeing from the tyranny of his own blood, he had sought refuge. On the morrow, the law was summoned to his kin's abode, and I followed, driven by an instinct to intervene. The officers, finding their hands bound by the letter of the law, bid me speak with the boy's parents, and I did. Their words were cloaked in nervousness and feeble excuses, painting their son's cries for help as mere manipulations. In that moment, the notion of social work grew roots within me, a resolve to aid those ensnared by the so-called \"simple\" disputes of kinship.\n\nJustice, too, beats at the heart of this vocation. In our society, we speak of the sanctity of the individual, yet our lamentations for the lost ring hollow, echoing traditions long past. If we truly mourn those who have departed, why then do we strive to mold ourselves in the likeness of others? I stand apart, unyielding, unwilling to don the chains of conformity. Through the years of my education, I railed against the injustices I encountered, be it through the colors in my hair, the fabric that clothed me, the piercings that adorned my skin, or my voice raised in alliance with those who dared to love freely. Against racism and discrimination, I have stood firm, and I shall continue to do so, for social justice is a cause I carry like a torch against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies the study of sleep and its many troubles. Insomnia, that persistent thief of rest, finds itself examined through the lenses of both biology and the tangled web of sociocultural influences. The biological path winds through the genetic landscapes, where the shadows of inheritance and the cold, clinical truths of medicine dwell. Meanwhile, the sociocultural path meanders through the interactions of environment, the unyielding constructs of race and class, and the burdens of demographic circumstance. This paper seeks to illuminate these paths, drawing upon the flickering candlelight of research to guide the way. Each study, like a stone in a riverbed, is turned over to reveal both its polished strengths and its hidden flaws.\n\nIn the realm of sleep's disorders, they are marked by primary afflictions or as symptoms tethered to deeper mental disturbances, or perhaps as shadows cast by other maladies. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to nightmares and waking terrors that haunt the night. Primary Insomnia, a restless foe that denies the comfort of sleep, stands opposed to Primary Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a distant shore. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into dream, and the rhythm of circadian disarray, all find their places in this litany of sleep's disorders. Parasomnias, with their spectral behaviors and strange physiological tales, recount nightmares and sleepwalks that traverse the boundaries of the conscious and unconscious. \n\nThe whisperings of the biological model speak of neurons and chemical messengers, the language of genes and heritable shadows. In the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons hold court, the balance of sleep and wakefulness is struck. Studies with mice, those silent witnesses to human inquiry, reveal the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, guardians of sleep states. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, calls forth the balm of sleep, while its silence begets restlessness. Such findings, though born in the minds of mice, suggest truths that may echo in the human form. \n\nYet, the sociocultural voice cannot be stilled. It murmurs of inherited phenotypes and the societal weights that press upon the individual. Should the receptors fail, the disturbance ripples outward, unsettling the delicate balance of life's pursuits. The classroom, the workplace, those spaces of mundane focus, all threatened by the restless nights. Thus, the disorder of insomnia is not merely a biological aberration but a reflection of the broader human condition, a testament to the intricate dance of genes and society.",
            "I have wandered these grounds at University Park for some two and a half years now. The semesters, four and a half in their passage. The campus sprawls wide and the journey across it is a trial for many, myself tangled among them. In the first year of my stay they placed me in a dorm by East Halls, near as far east as the campus will let you wander unless you count the vastness of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, my abode, to the distant halls of Willard, situated near the heart of this academic sprawl, could take up to twenty-five minutes by foot, longer if the skies turned foul as they often do in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time not long past when East Halls sat bordered by vast, empty lands. Now those tracts are filled with sports fields and looming edifices, the new Creamery and the health services building rising among them, hemmed in by apartments. As the campus stretches ever outward, the passage from one corner to another grows more arduous. And what remedy might there be for such a plight? On these grounds, it is the bicycle that holds promise. Yet a bike alone is no panacea. Students must take to them, and the campus must bend to their needs.  \nA friend of mine, who took up cycling again after years adrift, spoke of his wonder at why he ever left it. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a time it seemed folly to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Not only does it serve the body well, but bicycling stands as the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oats and a bit of muscle will carry you thirty miles or more. Like many of my peers, I dwell off campus now, as distant from the heart of things as some dorms might be. This year, the wisest move I've made was to acquire a bike. Each day I must reach the Thomas building, a good twenty-five-minute walk from my door if by foot alone. With the bike, the time shrinks to a scant five minutes, provided I ride with purpose. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, is not always an easy way, bike or no. There is merit in walking too, but I find my days too filled to afford it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas each day would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my hours. That's over two and a half hours lost to the week. And when you tally the time spent on foot to other classes and meetings and such, it becomes a cost too dear to pay.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Huxley’s Brave New World, there lies a world both strange and familiar, where the faces of men and women are but reflections in a glass darkly. A world where the hum of machines and the whispers of commerce form a haunting litany, binding all who dwell there in a dance of hollow joy. It is a place where the soul of man is woven into the great loom of technology and capitalism, and in its weaving, finds itself undone. These folk, these denizens of a new epoch, are cradled from birth in the arms of a manufactured happiness, a balm for the spirit that seeks no deeper truth than the surface of things. \n\nHere, the game is played on a vast board, the pieces moved by unseen hands, the World Controller the architect of destinies not their own. The specter of Marx watches over this tableau, for in its unfolding, there is laid bare the suspicion of systems, the uneasy dream of progress. Terms of art, words like homogeny and reification, whisper of a time when the soul of man was not yet sold to the highest bidder, when the heart sought more than the promise of a new thing. \n\nThe satire is sharp, the critique unyielding. False consciousness, the mask worn by the multitudes, is the child of capitalism’s embrace. The people, tethered to their desires, are blind to the chains that bind them. Their world is one of consumption, of endless want, and in hypnopædia's lullaby, they find their singular truth. The World Controller, the puppet master, ensures that the dance continues, that hegemony remains unchallenged. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, move through life unaware, ensnared in a web they cannot see, their thoughts not their own. \n\nEven the Alphas and Betas live in the shadow of the machine, their awareness a burden they do not wish to carry. Bernard, one among few, glimpses the strings, but even he finds himself swept along in the current. In this world, the social order is a mirror, reflecting the iron grip of capitalism, the silent hand that shapes all things. \n\nThere is no love here, no true bond between souls, only the echo of what once was. Huxley paints his characters as if they are but phantoms, their depths unexplored, for perhaps in this, he speaks of a truth—that the rise of machine and market has stripped away the essence of man. The heart’s desires are but shadows, fleeting and insubstantial. Men speak of women as objects, their words devoid of warmth or connection, and the women, in turn, speak boldly of encounters as if they were transactions, devoid of feeling. \n\nThe classes are content, blind to the bars of their gilded cage, their obedience a testament to the power of the unseen hand. The proletariat, in their consuming, are bound to the wheel, deceived into believing they are more than they are. In their complacency, we see the mark of Marx’s thought, the echo of a warning unheeded, as they move through their days in a dance of obedience, never questioning, never straying from the path laid before them.",
            "It was near four years gone now that I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at the college. And there in the modest room with its linoleum floor and wooden desks, we argued the nature of the religion, whether it was hostile and its intentions dark, or if there was another truth to be seen. I reckon the question has only grown more pertinent with time's passage. Since the day the towers fell, I've watched the media's stance shift from one of open hostility toward Islam and its extremists, to a more bewildering tolerance. I’d wager that back in 2001, the notion of a man named Barack Obama, with ties to the Muslim faith, standing as a candidate for the presidency would have seemed far-fetched.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I’ve come to know it, is a tale that fascinates me for its contradictions. The history of Muhammad, as I understood it, painted him as a conqueror, one who bent tribes to his will and demanded their submission to Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, misunderstood, humble in his dealings. People, so it is written, came to him of their own accord, drawn to the truth he preached.\n\nThere’s a curious likeness in the ministries of Jesus and the fabled acts of Muhammad. The most striking is the tale of the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. Such narratives lead me to suspect the writers intended to cast Muhammad in a light akin to a humble prophet, whose truth and miracles needed no defense. This, to my thinking, undermines the unique wonder of Christ’s life, as if they were pilfering the essence of Jesus to bolster Muhammad.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts that aim to show how folks, seemingly unbidden, found their way to Islam. Yet these tales often come from second or third-hand sources, hearsay and whispers. The intention, I reckon, was to lend authenticity, but it only served to sow doubt, rendering the stories suspect in my eyes.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. History paints a starkly different picture, one not of gentleness but of power and conquest. And I can't help but wonder if those who follow Islam today are aware of the true history that shadows the Prophet’s ascent.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, where the echoes of ancient footsteps still whisper, there lies the tale of a man whose teachings were like seeds scattered upon the earth, only to be left behind by the hands that tilled the fields of thought thereafter. The man, Jesus, spoke of truths in a world now shadowed by its own interpretations, and as the years have unfurled, the path of Christianity has wandered far from its source. In the broad sweep of history, a pattern emerges—a journey away from beginnings, a divergence carried by the winds of time. Yet in the present age, there stirs an awakening, a burgeoning consciousness that tugs at the roots of what has been sown. The world, as it stands, bears witness to a shift, a swell of progress that seeks to unravel the tapestry back to its original threads.\n\nIn this landscape of change, there are those who cling to the old ways, steadfast in their inheritance. They form a bulwark, a resistance, but their numbers may falter against the tide of history. Among the faithful, an awareness blooms, a thirst to discern the essence of the faith from the accretions of doctrine amassed over epochs. This quest for purity may span decades, perhaps centuries, but its course seems set—the wheel of Christian history poised to turn back upon itself. A great movement shall rise, a tide that peels away the layers of time, as if reversing the very flow of the hourglass, until what remains is a vision of what once was, a return to the simplicity of a carpenter's voice echoing in the hills of Galilee.\n\nThis tide shall sweep through lands, from the heartlands of America to the old world of Europe, drawing the multitudes to a form of worship stripped of all but the essence. The church, a bastion upon the shifting sands, shall guide this return, yet with the reversal of the theological clock shall come a convergence, a harmony in belief and practice that erodes the divisions long held sacred. Where once there were chasms, there shall be bridges; where once there were countless voices, a singular song. History is a river marked by such reversions, and the chronicles of man are filled with them. Recall the days when the Roman Empire, mighty and unyielding, sought to quench the flame of Christianity, only to be consumed by it in turn. The passage from chains to leadership in the American saga tells of a similar arc.\n\nThe reversion that looms upon the horizon of faith will see history undone, a search for the source, a dissolution of diversity into unity. Central to this unfolding shall be a reading of Jesus’ words, not as rigid proclamations, but as metaphors, keys to unlock deeper truths. Thus, the question remains—what path has led us here, since the days when Jesus walked among us? \n\nLook back, far into the shadows of antiquity, and there stands Judaism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of Christianity was raised. Monotheism, the revelation divine, the authority of Hebrew scripture—these were the pillars when Rome took Jerusalem beneath its banner in 63 B.C.E. Yet even then, the Jewish soul was not singular. It fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of the common folk, each with their own vision, their own truth.",
            "In the world Sinclair lays bare, there is a darkness in the human heart that speaks to greed as a natural law. The Jungle unfurls this truth with the relentless precision of a knife. Men scrabble through the bones of their own kind, seeking out the gold in marrow, eyes fixed only on their own horizon. The owners and masters of the roaring factories, these titans of industry, they are blind in their ambition. They see not the blood and smoke that rises to the heavens nor care for the souls crushed beneath their iron wheels. Sinclair writes of the monolithic structures, their silhouettes harsh against the sky, the smoke trailing to the world's edge. A testament to the cold heart of progress. He whispers of the filth that flows unchecked from the pens, a silent flood of waste that drowns the land.\n\nIn those days, the worth of a man was measured in dollars and cents, and a dollar he was not. \"A cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair calls it, a place where no shred of loyalty or decency remains. Men toil under the yoke of greed, hours stretching into the dim hours of night, only to be cast aside like husks without notice or recompense. Laws to shield them were scarce as water in a drought, leaving the workers to fend off the wolves alone, the managers urging them to the brink of ruin. The silence of suffering is deafening, the expectation that they endure the unendurable, the unsaid truth of their existence. No hand reaches out to lift them from their plight, no agency or soul to guide them through the wreckage. Unions rise and fall like dust, feeding off the laborers as surely as their masters. They are slaves in all but name, described by Sinclair as a people on the edge of starvation, bound to the whims of men as cruel as any slave driver of old. Immorality blooms in such soil, inevitable as weeds in an untended field.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature, where shadows linger and words echo, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the depths of man's imagination. Poe, in his craft, invokes the ancient term “Thulé,” a relic of Virgil's musings, a whisper of lands beyond known maps, where the Greeks once dreamed the world might end. Virgil's invocation of Thulé clings to the edges of history, and yet, in Poe's hands, it finds new life, perhaps spurred by his fascination with the Germanic soul, the echoes of Goethe.\n\nIn this dance of words, Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of old, draws a line between Poe and Goethe, suggesting the former's mimicry of the latter, as if one shadow were cast by another. Goethe, a giant of letters, left the world his Faust, a tale in two acts, the first breathing life in 1808 and the second released as he himself returned to the earth in 1832. Nestled within Faust's verses lies “The King of Thulé,” a mournful tale of a king bereft, his queen gone to dust, her memory etched in a goblet, a testament to loss and the slow poison of remembrance. The king, now adrift, surrenders his worldly goods, save the goblet, which he flings into the abyss of the sea before surrendering to his own fate.\n\nThe air of Thulé, dark and foreboding, mirrors the landscapes of Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" where specters of dead companions haunt the speaker, and the world's colors fade to a shadowed gray. The King of Thulé, in his drink and despair, is perhaps a reflection of Poe's own demons, a dark twin of grief and the solace found in the bottle. It is no wonder that less than a year before Poe penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the term Thulé seeped into his consciousness, a thread connecting him to the romantic dramas that swept the stage in the wake of Goethe's shadow.\n\nIn the storied passages of Poe's collected works, Thulé emerges, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" as “ultima Thule,” and then twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem like a silent sentinel. The words draw the pieces together, a dialogue across time with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscapes of both are heavy with solitude and loss, as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has wandered into Goethe's lament, a spectral journey through the ruin of memory.\n\nGoethe, a pillar of the literary world, would have been a presence in Poe's mind, if for no other reason than the respect he bore for Tennyson. In the weave of words, Poe's path crosses with Goethe, through the echoes of their shared respect for the poet laureate, and in the manifold translations and adaptations that Goethe's works inspired. Thus, in the quiet spaces between lines, one finds the soul of Poe, reaching back to touch the hand of Goethe, through the veil of Thulé.",
            "In the land of California, where the sun beats down upon the fields and the law holds sway like an ancient scripture, there arose a question of justice. Could a soul, battered and bruised from a fall upon spilled applesauce in a store, seek the cold comfort of punitive recompense by claiming the keeper of the store harbored malice in his heart? This keeper, twice informed of the slick danger, yet chose his meal over duty's call for a full thirty minutes. \n\nThe judge, he sits there in his black robes, not likely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive measures without due consideration. She must show the court that the storekeeper's deeds were not just negligent, but born of a willful disregard for the harm that might ensue, that his conduct was vile in its indifference. Palmer will lay before them the tale of Martin, who should have known better, for in the months before her own mishap, others had danced unbidden upon similar spills, their cries echoing in the aisles. Yet Martin, with eyes wide open to the chaos, chose inaction. Her claim of his despicable nature might ring weaker, yet it gains strength from the stores of history, six times in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine had bones met the hard floor and Martin remained unmoved.\n\nOn a day in October, the thirteenth of the month at the hour when the sun begins its descent, Rich Wayne, a servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin with news of the applesauce peril. Martin, seated at his table, dismissed the warning, preferring the solace of his meal. Fifteen minutes passed and another, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm anew, only to be met with the same disdain. And so it was at that time, half past the hour, that Palmer found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's negligence. Five times before had the store seen such calamity that year alone. And now Palmer seeks both compensation for her pain and punishment for the neglect that led her there, while they deliberate on whether to pursue a motion against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the eyes of Californian law, one may grasp at punitive damages not born of contract if the transgressor acted with the shadows of oppression, deceit, or malice. The code speaks of malice as a deed intended to wound or, if not intended, so loathsome in its execution that it was done with a knowing and willful neglect of the safety owed to others. The courts have seen malice in the actions of those who, knowing the peril their deeds might unleash, chose not to avert the storm. Thus, the tale unfolds, and the law and the land await what justice will decree.",
            "She had always been haunted by a sense of wanting, a hollow yearning that refused to be sated, a ghost of desire that whispered in the shadows of her being. It had begun when she was fourteen, a tender age when the world first began to reveal its vastness and its mysteries, and it lingered still three years hence at seventeen. By then, she knew it was someone she sought, not something, yet no boy had caught her eye. Suitors had come and gone, awkward rituals of courtship unfurling like some ancient dance, but her heart remained unmoved. She questioned this peculiar state, pondering what might cause such a deviation from the expected path of a young girl's heart. The years spun out theories in her mind like gossamer threads, none substantial enough to unravel her enigma. So she drifted through life, her desires a riddle murmuring in her soul.\n\nThe days at home were serene, a stillness that wrapped around her like a quilt. Her parents were gentle folk, their voices never raised in anger, and disputes with their daughter were rare as rain in a desert. Their only quarrel lay in her fierce independence, a fire that flared bright against their calm. She was a daughter who danced to her own tune, a burst of color in the quiet tapestry of their lives, her vibrancy a magnet for others drawn to her light.\n\nBut today the peace shattered like glass. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark to ignite her own restless spirit, a scream knifed through the stillness—a sharp note from her mother’s voice. She flew to the kitchen, panic rising like a tide within her. \"Mom?! Mom, what's the matter?!\" Her mother lay prone on the floor, pain etched into every line of her face, breath coming in short, pained gasps. \"Ow,\" she whispered, \"swee... ty, I... need you to take me... to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed from her, each a testament to her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me what to do.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her gently in the back, then drove with a heart pounding with urgency.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of sterility and fear, its air thick with the scent of antiseptic and unspoken dread. But she did not smell it, her mind consumed by the singular task of aiding her mother. She carried her inside, her voice a beacon calling for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched into their features. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, whisking her away into the labyrinth of care. The daughter was left behind, a solitary sentinel in a waiting room of worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase perched high upon a cabinet, a simple act that had spiraled into calamity.",
            "In the vast annals of human inquiry, this study was wrought from the necessity to discern the bond between adherence to what the ancients called the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of chronic heart disease and the grim reaper known as stroke. The diet, in its alternate form, the aMed diet, stands as a testament to simplicity and the earth’s bounty. It whispers of fruits and nuts, whole grains, legumes, and the oils of olives, favoring the unsaturated over the bloated excesses of animal fats, allowing for the gentle indulgence of the vine's nectar.\n\nIn the chronicles of science past, there have been whispers, threads of evidence woven into tales of this diet’s power over the heart's maladies and the relentless march of mortality. Its superiority over the austere confines of a low-fat regimen was noted, a harbinger of weight shed and the blood’s chemistry altered. Yet, in these tales, the dire strokes of fate were oft left in shadow.\n\nThe saga unfolds with seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, nurses by trade, from the tender age of thirty-eight to the cusp of sixty-three. They, unmarked by the histories of cardiovascular affliction or diabetes, stood as sentinels in this study, woven into the fabric of the Nurses' Health Study that spanned eleven states. From the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four to two thousand and four, their dietary tales were recorded sixfold through the self-reported food frequency questionnaires. The steadfastness of these women was near absolute, with over ninety-five percent holding true to the course across two decades. Their reports of heart and stroke were etched in the stone of medical records and autopsies, or when absent, deemed probable, casting a shadow on a small fraction of strokes and heart events.\n\nTo grasp the truth of their diet, the scores were culled from years past, smoothing the randomness of a single year’s consumption. Age and smoke, the weight of their bodies, the state of their hormones, all were accounted for, lest they cloud the findings. The hand of Cox modeling was employed, sifting through the sands of data to reveal the link between diet and the fates of heart and stroke, each in their fatal and nonfatal guises.\n\nThe reckoning was clear. Those women who embraced the diet of the Mediterranean, who stood atop the quintile, found themselves less likely to fall to the ravages of heart and stroke than those who lingered at the base, their risk reduced by a measure of 0.71. Such was the tale told by the study over the long years, a testament to the diet’s power against the silent killers of the heart and brain.",
            "The sign says Hitler lives in Burma.  \nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner. Her arm raised high, clutching a piece of cardboard with those words scrawled in dark Sharpie, a message bleak and unsettling. Burma, or Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, ruled by a harsh military junta whose grip tightened in 1962 when power was seized in a coup d'état. In 2007, the streets bore witness to protests not seen in a decade, led by the holy men clad in saffron robes, the monks. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, named for the hue of the robes that draped the monks, those bearers of peace in a land shrouded in tyranny. At first the junta watched with reluctance as the monks assembled peacefully, but soon the tide turned. Violence surged and the streets became a battleground, monasteries desecrated by the hands of soldiers. Foreign eyes that dared to capture truth were snatched, imprisoned. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27, 2007—his only crime, witnessing the streets' unrest. The official count said thirteen lost souls, but Colonel Hla Win, a man who fled the army's ranks, spoke of more, a multitude silenced, bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nYet this is no new tale. History is a scroll of blood and power, of rulers who stifle the breath of dissent to clutch their dominion. The emperors of Rome, claiming divine favor, wielded absolute power over their domains. In Japan, emperors walked as gods among men, leading their people into modernity and death alike. Our own president, George W. Bush, converses weekly with Ted Haggard, a shepherd of the unenlightened flock, under the aegis of the Republic Party.\n\nThe pages of history are marked by such tyranny. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars and laborers and youth stood against the iron rule of governance, tell of a massacre veiled by numbers that shift like sand, from the government's two or three hundred to the thousands whispered by the Chinese Red Cross. Rwanda in the nineties, its soil soaked with the blood of Tutsis and moderates alike, slaughtered by Hutu militias with the government's nod. And then there was the Third Reich, Hitler's reign, a dark age when Jewish lives were extinguished across nations.",
            "In the long shadows cast by the night, a man sits at a piano, fingers tracing the keys as if they were the lines of a well-worn map. His name is Duke Ellington, a name that carries with it the weight of years and the echoes of a hundred thousand notes. His legacy in the world of jazz is woven not merely from time but from the threads of creation, an orchestra shaped by his hand and mind. The piano, his silent companion, whispers its presence in the compositions that dance like phantoms across the worn paper, each one a testament to Ellington’s genius. As a composer, he built worlds within worlds, crafting pieces of such intricate beauty that the band members found their true voices within his frames.\n\nEllington’s genius lay in the way he understood the soul of his orchestra, each player a solitary note in a grand symphony. He forged spaces where the soloist could soar, untethered, while simultaneously crafting phrases that bound the ensemble in a tapestry of sound, each thread a reflection of his vision. In this alchemy, he found the soul of his music, a coherent sound that was uniquely his own. His mastery was not just of the notes but of the men who played them, and in that mastery, he wrote his name across the annals of jazz history.\n\nAmong the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, there are whisperings of Ellington’s sound, a sound that found voice in the piece known as Creole Love Call. Here, the voice becomes not a vessel of words, but an instrument, pure and unadorned. This was Ellington’s way, weaving texture and color into the silence, a testament to his skill in complementing the voices of his soloists. The slow cadence of a twelve-bar blues unfolds, each chorus a chapter in a story without words:\n\nThe first chorus, a conversation between voice and reeds, begins softly, a gentle melody that grows rougher, more insistent. The muted trumpet follows, exploring the melody’s shadows, bending notes to its will. A clarinet rises, sweeping high above the earth, underpinned by the subtle syncopation of the piano. The full band swells, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a call and response. As the fifth chorus builds, the reeds take the lead, their voices high and clear, the rhythm section marking time in syncopated stops. And the final chorus returns to the beginning, the voice growling as an instrument, echoing the dialogue with the reeds. A brief tag closes the piece, a vocal run ending in the dissonant sigh of a trombone.\n\nEllington’s voice, his true instrument, lies in the way he colors a piece, each note a brushstroke in a masterwork. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his skill at orchestration melds with his ear for tone. ‘Bubber’ Miley’s muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox’s scat singing, each voice a reflection of the other, creating a sound both rich and strange. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further, Ellington’s hand guiding Joe ‘Tricky Sam’ Nanton’s muted trombone to introduce the melody, a touchstone in the vast landscape of Ellington’s creation.",
            "In the quiet calculus of life, why do creatures change their form as they do? What hidden hands bid them to evolve along certain paths and not others? It's a question pondered by men given to deeper thoughts than most, like D'Arcy Thompson, who mused upon the mathematical nature of life’s simplest forms, way back in the year 1917. And even now, the riddle remains unsolved. Yet, with the passage of years, minds like Raup and Stanley turned their gaze to the humble mollusk, seeking patterns in the spiral dance of shells across the ages.\n\nOur inquiry ventures into the realm of hard numbers and soft forms, where we study the genus Prunum through the twin lenses of mathematics and experiment. We harness the power of X-rays to capture the ghostly outlines of shells, parsing them into figures and formulas that might unlock the secrets of evolutionary change. Into the computer’s maw we feed these numbers, using a tool born of the modern age, CerioShell, to conjure forth visions of shells that might have been. These visions help us chart the borders of possibility, the land where change is born.\n\nConsider a shell, not merely as nature’s ornament, but as a tale writ in stone, a tube spun slowly through the vastness of time. Each revolution, each whirl around its hidden axis—the columella—is a chapter in its story. The pace of its growth, the lines of its past, these sutures, they whisper of its journey. At its heart is the body whorl, last and largest, while the spire rises, apex to base, as if reaching for the heavens. Life within reaches out through the aperture, the portal to its world.\n\nIn contemplation, these shells reveal themselves from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural—as if inviting understanding from every perspective. The common view, aperture forward, apex skyward, speaks most clearly to us.\n\nTo count the whorls is to trace the labyrinthine path of life itself. Begin at the shell’s peak, mark the start of its first suture, and divide its form with an unseen line. From here, the whorls count themselves, each a testament to a quarter turn more of life’s relentless march.\n\nView the shell as a procession of apertures, a dance through space and time, as the creature within builds its spiraled home. By plotting the center of each whorl’s aperture, by charting the radius both wide and high, we map this journey.\n\nAnd in this mapping, in these symbols and signs, lies the power to alter the course of skeletogenesis, to walk the path of gods and change the fate of mollusks. We turn the unknown into known, the unseen into seen, through the lens of mathematics that seeks to comprehend the very essence of life’s unfolding.",
            "In the quiet lands of Indonesia, where the sun casts long shadows upon the earth, the toll of newborns and infants taken too soon has held its ground against the passage of a decade. Though the nation strides with purpose toward the Millennium Development Goals, like a traveler on a well-trodden path to fresh waters and purified air, the hopes for the health of mothers and their children remain distant, like a mirage in the desert sands. These aspirations, unmet, speak of a need not for mere remedies but for the fortification of the very foundations of their healing ways.\n\nIn the villages and towns, they have seen the hands of skilled healers at the birthside grow more frequent, now at seventy-two in every hundred, yet among these are those whose craft is of the old ways, the midwives, whose gentle guidance cannot stave off the crimson tide should it rise. Thus, the numbers, though they tell a tale of progress, do whisper deceitfully of a journey far from its end. The children who suffer the scourge of diarrhea find fewer hands of trained healers to comfort them, and in the days after birth, the care that should cradle mother and child falters, a flickering candle in the wind.\n\nIn the realm of childbirth, the knife that might save a life is seldom wielded, with cuts made in only four of every hundred. In the bustling heart of the cities, these cuts are sevenfold, yet in the quiet stretches of the countryside, they dwindle to two. It is a stark telling of a land divided by access, where the healing touch gathers in cities and leaves the rural folk to fend with less. Among the rich and the poor, a chasm of twenty-seven in a hundred stands, a testament to the hardships faced by those with less, their way barred by the weight of coin.\n\nAnd so, the road ahead lies obscured by questions. How shall they breathe life into the care for mother and child? Should they seek the allure of singular paths, or should they bind their strength to the shaping of a robust system, one that does not forsake those at the start and end of life’s journey? The call of focused endeavors, like the siren’s song, is tempting, promising swift victories with clear goals. Yet, heed must be given to the shadows they cast, for a heavy hand upon one part may drain the lifeblood from another, drawing away the healers to where the riches flow. Parallel tracks in the sand, uncoordinated and redundant, lead only to a tangle of forms, a labyrinth of papers and pleas.\n\nThus, the story unfolds, and the choices lie before them like roads diverging in a quiet wood, each with its promise and peril. The way must be chosen with care, for upon it rests the hope of many, the silent prayer for a brighter dawn.",
            "In the slow turning of a century past, the landscape of what folks call Popular Music has grown wild and tangled, a bramble of genres blooming in every direction, so that to name them all is a task near impossible. Each genre, be it rap or rock or country, jazz or folk, has given birth to myriad offspring, sub-genres breeding sub-sub-genres like rivers splitting into streams. Among these, there stands Heavy Metal, a colossus that has, over the span of four decades, become a thing both diverse and expressive, a shadowed mirror to the human heart. It speaks in tones of darkness, a symphony of the night, yet it is an art form of many voices, each taking the bones of the old and crafting anew, creating sub-strains and further branches that stretch toward the horizon without end.\n\nAnd now, in this present time, the heavy metal kingdom is a labyrinth of niches and factions, each claiming its own piece of the sky, so that one might ponder what heavy metal truly is. It is a mosaic, a tapestry woven with threads borrowed from other realms, yet its roots are deep, and to grasp the essence of today's metal, one must turn back to understand the movement itself, the force that drives it beyond mere classification as a genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement sculpted in shadow. It is the music of excess, a cacophony of more—more depth, more sound, more fury, more spectacle. Gone is the simplicity, for those who play do so with a mastery that speaks through the strings and skins. It is a movement, too, that bears the mark of illusion, the haze of substances that fueled the mid-seventies, leading artists to the edge of madness and beyond, crafting records that seemed to belong to other worlds, the drugs a veil through which creation was glimpsed. It holds within it a rawness, a ferocity that was unfamiliar in the realm of popular song, which so often shied away from the shadows. The generations that followed drew from this well of darkness, finding kinship with the tumultuous emotions of the Romantic Era, a lineage of passion and despair. \n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a tune that laid bare the shadowed side of the Beatles, a descent and ascent that mirrored the wild dance of the mind under the spell of substances. This song, some say, stands as one of the forebears of Heavy Metal itself, an answer to the Stones' own dark offering, a declaration that the Beatles too could summon the weight of thunder, and so it found its place upon The White Album.",
            "In a time before the Surrealists laid their brushstrokes upon the canvas of dreams, Henri Rousseau stood alone, a solitary figure crafting visions from the depths of his own soul. The year was 1910, and in his painting The Dream, Rousseau conjured not just the image of a woman transfixed by the marvels of an ethereal land but wove into its fabric the essence of his own aspirations and desires. For within that lush jungle, Rousseau's yearning for recognition and acclaim by his peers and the art world at large lay entwined with the foliage. His journey was fraught with the quiet turmoil of choosing between the mimicry of established forms for acceptance and the uncharted path of creative independence.\n\nTo peer into the heart of The Dream, one must first wander through the shadowed corridors of Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, France, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man who enjoyed the modest comforts of bourgeois life (Shattuck 47). Rousseau was untouched by the formal teachings of artistry, laboring instead under the yoke of the gabelou, the municipal toll service, until he found himself at forty, wrongly dubbed a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). Tragedy cast a long shadow over his days, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children leaving him with but one daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief (Shattuck 49). It was to the canvas he turned, seeking solace and rebirth amidst the pigments.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau painted with the simplicity and sincerity of the folk, driven by the dreams common to his kind. His quest for acceptance was a natural desire, one amplified by his lack of formal education and the lateness of his start in a world brimming with younger, celebrated talents. It was not until the likes of Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's art found its way into the light. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, draws a line between the two: Matisse, who feared the mundane, and Rousseau, who longed for his art to be conventional enough to secure a place in the Artiste Français (92). And so, Rousseau's brush moved, caught between worlds, painting his dreams with the hope of finding his place among them.",
            "The old thinkers, long given to pondering, have often drawn a line twixt the realms of ethics and aesthetics, a bridge between truth and beauty. There’s a deep-seated reason for this, like the poet Keats murmured in his ode upon that ancient urn, where he spoke of beauty and truth as if they were one and the same. In the world, much is learned through books and the hard hand of experience, yet there lies a knowledge of ethics and aesthetics that seems to spring forth unbidden, needing no teacher's voice. These aren't mere prescriptions, but rather descriptions of the world’s order. Our musings on what is moral or what is beautiful oft become pursuits to understand why a painting captivates or why a deed rings true, rather than setting down laws for art or conduct.\n\nCritiques of art or ethics falter, never grasping the whole of what makes something good or beautiful. Take, for instance, that enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa; one might speak of its lines, its shadows, its place in the heart of culture, but these alone cannot capture why it grips the soul. When asked of a beloved piece of art or tale, folks often say there’s just something about it, hinting at a truth that eludes the grasp of words. Art and morals resist reduction, as Flannery O'Connor once said, for a story speaks truths that plain statements cannot. Even when we lay bare every facet of a tale, something ineffable remains. Ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein once whispered of ethics as a thing that cannot be spoken, a transcendental force. It’s this elusive something, this je ne sais quoi, that grants both art and morality their power, binding them in their shared transcendence.\n\nMorality and art walk hand in hand, for they touch us at a level beyond mere explanation, like the noumenon Kant spoke of. They move us where words stumble and fail. This bond is even more pronounced in literature, where, as McKean observed, its moral heart sets it apart from other arts. While moral standards might seem unfitting for music, they are woven into literature as they are into life itself. Living demands values, and literature holds our interest precisely because of the values it unveils.",
            "In the present age, Germany stands as a formidable entity, a nation forged in unity with a culture as diverse as the landscapes it spans, from the shadowy folds of the Bavarian Alps in München to the northern reaches by the Baltic in Kiel. This cultural tapestry weaves itself through Köln on the banks of the Rhine, stretching across the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden upon the Elbe. Such a singular culture springs from myriad origins, a confluence of tribes and histories that bore the Germany we now behold.\n\nThe land of Germania, ancient and storied, is the cradle from which the Germans arise. The very name stirs dispute among the learned, tangled in the annals of history. Tacitus once wrote of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name German before ever they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. So claimed the historian in a distant age. And before him, Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, uttered the word \"Germanus\" to mark the tribes who dwelt beyond his reach, ever skirmishing across the river's breadth. He borrowed this name from the Gauls to delineate those he had conquered from those yet unconquered. The true origin remains shrouded, some say a neighborly term in the Gaulish tongue, while others muse on the spear, the ger, or the Old Irish cry, garim, that spoke of a people boisterous in battle.\n\nTacitus, in his account from AD 98, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" mused upon the Germans' beginnings, suggesting they were untouched by foreign mingling. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" Who, he pondered, would forsake the temperate climes of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germania, with its harsh skies and dour visage, unless it were indeed his home?\n\nAnd what Roman, in possession of the world's bounty, would trade the grandeur of Rome for the untamed expanse of Germania? None but the legions, driven by conquest, seeking goods to haul back to their empire's heart. From time to time, they ventured forth, their campaigns in those lands brief and often returning them to Rome's embrace. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes, emerging in the first century's midst, lingered at the empire's edge. They bartered their harvests and lent their strength to Rome's legions, straddling the line between alliance and independence. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the theater of Twelfth Night, the masks we wear might shelter us for a spell, but they demand a reckoning. A man or woman might craft a new face to wear, but the danger lies in the wearing of it too long. For should one cling too dearly to such deception, they might find themselves estranged from their own soul. The shedding of a false skin comes with its own perils, and in the casting off, one might stand alone, alienated from kin and friend alike. The choice then falls upon the deceiver, to hold fast to the truth of themselves or to preserve the fragile bonds with those around them. For the revelation of deceit is a coin with two faces, some might shrug and carry on, while others would storm and rail against the perceived betrayal.\n\nThe play casts a particular light on the tangle of deception in matters of gender, raising the question that gnaws at the heart: why does one abandon their own visage for another? In Viola’s plight, the reason is plain as day. She dons her disguise not for trickery’s sake but as a shield against the unknown dangers of a foreign shore. Her words speak of necessity, a captain and a cloak to veil her maidenhood and safeguard her path: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…”\n\nYet, this guise, while a bulwark, serves also as a wall, cutting her off from her sisters, leaving her adrift without the solace of shared womanhood. Worse still, her mask is so complete that Olivia, mistaking the semblance for truth, entwines her heart with Viola’s. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” And further, there lies the unspoken bond with Orsino, a thread stretched taut by hidden desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nA modern eye might see in this a tale of how deception unravels the knots of hidden emotions, forcing the likes of Olivia and Orsino to face shadows they never knew. Does Olivia love a man because she sees a man, or is there a deeper truth she dares not name? Yet, the ease with which she turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a simpler parody, a reflection of those who place trust in appearances alone. Her words to Viola, “A sister, you are she,” reveal a heart that shifts with the tides, from lover to kin, as if the mask itself had drawn a line between them. \n\nAnd so, the play dances on, a mirror held up to the fractures of identity and desire, a world where the truth is both a burden and a blessing.",
            "The annals of German dominion over foreign lands bear witness to a severity that has not gone unnoticed, especially in the dark recesses of history where the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples lies, buried but not forgotten, amidst the arid expanses of German South West Africa. Yet to cast one's net so wide as to catch the entirety of an empire within a single narrative is folly. The German colonial empire sprawled across diverse lands, each holding its own tale of governance and policy, its own way of educating those under its shadow. It was a patchwork of intentions and executions.\n\nWhen the British unfurled their flag over German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they discovered a populace not unfamiliar with letters and learning, a testament to the German efforts in education. Kamerun and other colonies too bore the marks of an educational legacy that garnered praise from the chroniclers of the time. But South West Africa, present-day Namibia, stood apart, a land where the sun baked the earth and the minds of its native people were left largely untouched by the hands of formal education. The government there had turned its gaze away, leaving missionary societies to the task with scant support, while it poured resources into the schooling of its own kind, building state schools for Europeans and tightening its grip on the missionary endeavors.\n\nThis divergence bore its fruit in the years that followed the German retreat. Where other colonies could count among their numbers a host of literate and learned Africans, South West Africa remained a land of silence and illiteracy for the native majority. The reasons for this schism are tangled in the roots of social, political, and economic factors, a web this paper seeks to unravel, drawing upon fresh insights into the mindset of settlers and the colonial governors who ruled them.\n\nThe corpus of writings on German colonial education is vast, yet primarily penned in the tongue of its origin and from a time not long after the empire's fall. These early accounts sought to capture the essence of the educational systems, while later works in English brought forth a comparative gaze, revealing the disparities between colonies and delving deeper into the particulars of their educational frameworks. Cohen's treatise stands as a pillar among these, examining the schooling of South West and East Africa, juxtaposing their systems and probing the roots of their differences. He points to the substantial settler populace in South West Africa as a key to understanding its peculiarities.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climes and sweeping deserts, offered a refuge of sorts for European settlers. By the year 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly fifteen thousand, a stark contrast to the mere five thousand three hundred thirty-six who made their homes in East Africa, the next bastion of settler presence. These figures, like the land itself, tell a story of harsher divides and unyielding landscapes.",
            "The lands of the United States and Mexico once lay locked in a dance of discord, a rivalry that stretched itself thin over fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord eighteen thirty-six till eighteen ninety-three. The Mexican-American War of eighteen forty-six to forty-eight marked the pinnacle of this tumult, where the United States, with the vigor of its manifest destiny, surged forth and wrested from Mexico the lands of Texas and the great American Southwest. These nations found themselves caught in a litany of skirmishes and quarrels, the echoes of their enmity lingering on the winds till the eve of the Great War. The seed of their discord was sown deep in the soil of their disparate beliefs, a chasm of religion and culture dividing them, and a clash of material desires stoking the fires of their discontent.\n\nThis tale is not a solitary one, for many a nation has found in its neighbor a rival, the shared border a line drawn in sand and blood. The United States and Mexico stand as testament to such enduring rivalries, their histories intertwined like the gnarled roots of an ancient tree. David M. Pletcher wrote of these long-standing American quandaries, noting that Mexico and Cuba, like old wounds, troubled the United States more than any other nations of the southern continent. In contrast, other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations with the North.\n\nIn the shadows of this struggle lay the specter of religion, a divide as ancient as any other. The clash of faiths, a battle fought not with swords but with the convictions of souls. As Sally Frahm observed, the Americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries bore an aversion to Catholicism much as their descendants would to the ideologies of fascism and communism. The distrust between these two peoples was an inheritance from their colonial progenitors, the English and the Spanish, and it stood as a monolith barring the path to peace.\n\nSeventeen disputes mark the annals of this rivalry, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts, most of them squabbles over the rugged frontier where bandits roamed and border towns lay vulnerable to the lawless throng. Only the might of military force from both sides would quell the chaos that lingered at the edges of civilization.\n\nAs the years drew on, the rivalry began to fade, not with a final clash but with a shift in the balance. Mexico found itself reliant on the United States, the former's ambitions turning from territorial conquest to the subtler arts of economic influence. And thus, the chapter closed on a rivalry that had marked the landscape of two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an illness unknown to me claimed my body and left it undone, a sudden and unforeseen affliction that turned my world to shadow. I was a nurse then, a calling I had chosen from a need so deep it seemed carved into my very bones—a craving for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"You'll always have work; sickness will never cease,\" the voices of my upbringing echoed as I grew. And so it was that my dreams of science and the written word, dreams of becoming both a seeker and a scribe, faded like the twilight, and I embraced the path of healing.\n\nYet there I stood at forty-six, solitary and without a fortune to call my own, rendered incapable of toil. Disabled still, I have endured fifteen years upon the meager rations of Social Security, and now all that remains is the stark truth of having nothing that bears the mark of mine. I endure, but each day is a trial, a relentless assault upon my soul. Certainty is a stranger to me now, but one truth remains steadfast—I could not have traversed these years without the steadfast aid of kin and comrades. For when disaster strikes, the strength you thought you possessed vanishes like mist on the wind.\n\nEmergencies, both grand and trivial, are life's constant companions, and no amount of preparation can shield you from every storm. It is folly to place our trust in the bloated belly of bureaucracy, as it crumbles and decays before our eyes. Instead, I yearn for a nation where trust is sown among us, where we once more turn to our neighbors for aid and offer our own hands in return, rather than retreating into solitude behind the barricades of our own making.\n\nThe rugged individualism that is oft heralded as the foundation of this land is but a myth. It was compassion, shared burdens, and the pooling of resources that sustained our forebears through their trials. The pioneers who braved the vastness of the Rockies did not find the coast by the strength of their own arms alone.\n\nSo yes, be prepared. As am I. A kit for disaster sits ready, stocked with the necessities: first aid, tablets to cleanse water, plastic sheathing and tape to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their batteries, candles and matches that defy the rain, canned sustenance, all await the hour of need. If you possess the means for a plot of earth and the skill to preserve its bounty, seize it. A wood stove is a boon, provided you do not dwell too high above the ground.\n\nBut in your preparations, do not forget this: the knowing of your neighbors is a gift beyond measure.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, somewhere in the shadowed centuries before the Christ, a prince was born unto the world. He would come to be known as the Buddha, a name that would echo through the ages. Through his life, he turned his back on the opulence of princely realms and sought enlightenment, his teachings giving rise to a path known as Buddhism. Among its branches, the Theravada sect stands as the oldest, like a tree whose roots run deep into ancient soil. Two and a half millennia have passed since then, and time has molded the religion, casting it into forms unimagined in the Buddha’s days. In lands such as Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds each year, a dance of monks and laymen alike. This ritual, absent from the original teachings, speaks to the inexorable change that has touched even the core of Buddhist belief. The essence of Theravada, from the rituals to the very heart of its doctrine, has felt the tremors of transformation, driven by forces both within and beyond, some adversarial, others indifferent.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, we must lay out certain terms. Internal forces arise from the heart of the Buddhasasana, from those who walk the path of the monk and the layman. External forces are those that press upon the community from the outside, from those untouched by Buddhist doctrine. Hostile forces bear the weight of malice, seeking to rend the fabric of the faith, while benign forces drift without purpose, indifferent yet capable of leaving their mark. These terms will be the compass for our exploration.\n\nLet us first peer into the core of Theravada Buddhism, into the doctrines that form its bedrock. The Buddhist seeks refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, vast and profound, is encompassed within the Tripitaka, the triune scripture. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Therein lie the truths of Anatta, the soul’s absence; Dukkha, life’s suffering; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by embracing these can one sever the cycle of Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to the chains of desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the path, with five precepts to guide the layman—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, do not cloud the mind with intoxicants. The monk’s path is one of greater discipline. At the heart of it all lie the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering; second, that suffering’s root is attachment; third, that liberation is within reach."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the dim-lit corridors where men gather to parley, culture weaves its invisible hand through the discourse. It is more a shadow of what it is not than a clear form of what it is, a shapeshifter not bound by singularity nor uniformity. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are yielding is to paint the world with crude strokes. A negotiator must look beyond such pale generalizations and grasp the essence of a culture's significance, how it might twist and turn the conversations at the table. When a man steps into the foreign realms of another's culture, he sees it mirrored against his own, the lines and edges both familiar and strange.\n\nTo peer into the heart of another's culture is to traverse its history, to discern its biases. It is not for a man to judge or reshape a culture but to accept it for what it is, to navigate its currents, especially when the tide is against him. When a negotiator finds himself on foreign soil, reverence for custom and creed becomes a bridge over chasms unseen, propelling the dialogue onward.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to the borders of nations. Within the same land, companies birth their own cultures, some prizing long hours, others a gentler pace. You see it in the garb of the employees, in words spoken sharply or softly, in the hands that delegate or toil. A company may open its arms to charity unbound or tether it to sanctioned causes. In America, the corporate landscape is a tapestry of variance, each company a thread of its own hue. Even within the same firm, from urban sprawl to quiet suburbia, diversity of thought abounds. In lands less fractured, cultures may appear seamless, yet beneath that veneer lies complexity.\n\nValues, more than anything, carve the soul of a culture. If the need to save face or keep the peace runs deep, a negotiator will not disgrace his kin for a mere victory. Conversely, where the hard bargain is king, one does not rush to close the deal. To carry these truths into negotiation is wisdom, yet knowing the man across the table, his heart and mind, lends a sharper edge to the enterprise.",
            "In the dim recesses of the human heart, the fool declares, there is no God, and so it begins, this ancient psalm making its way through the corridors of time, finding its echo in the meditations of St. Anselm, who would carve out his argument for the Maker's existence from the clay of his own belief. And yet, this same conviction stirs also in the soul of Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts we are bound to unearth. Both men stand as sentinels defending the same citadel, and our task is to discern whose fortifications hold more true. We shall proceed with the notion, for brevity's sake, that both speak of a God who breathes life into scripture's pages. To entertain visions of gods not present in their contemplation would be to lose sight of the endeavor: to measure their arguments by the same light they sought to illuminate.\n\nSt. Anselm's path begins with the inward gaze, a journey through faith where understanding is born. He speaks of God residing in the architecture of our understanding, an existence so deeply woven into the fabric of our minds that to unravel it is to court impossibility. His words, though they twist and turn with the intricacies of their own making, bear a simple truth: the divine is a certainty found not in the world of flesh and bone but within the silent chambers of our own consciousness. He calls us to behold the truth of God's being through the lens of faith, a vision untainted by the need for worldly proof, for such faith is often the currency of the devout.\n\nYet turn now to St. Thomas Aquinas, whose thoughts tread a different trail. Here, the argument is built not on faith alone but on the solid ground of reason and evidence. Aquinas would have us believe that the existence of God is a tapestry woven from the threads of logic, a pattern clear to the rational eye. This would serve well the cause of those who seek to spread the word, for it requires not the leap of faith but the steady march of reason. He unfurls five banners of thought: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a testament to the necessity of a divine presence. Like a puzzle missing a final piece, the universe, with all its complexities, hints at a God unseen yet undeniable, a conclusion reached not by faith alone but by the relentless pursuit of reason.",
            "Authors wield their pen like a blade, cutting through the fabric of perception to lay bare the soul of a tale. They employ their own alchemies, some more potent than others, to shape the reader's heart toward the truths they seek to unveil. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, crafts his narrative with a deft hand, using an array of such techniques. His words are like brushstrokes, pairing unlikely companions—a noun and an adjective—to conjure an atmosphere around his subjects. In other instances, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors that whisper secrets to the reader's mind. Gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink, all become the language of the world he weaves. \n\nFitzgerald paints the canvas of his story with these hues, building layer upon layer of meaning. White and gray are his palette of uniformity; white, a shade of the upper echelons, and gray, its worn and weary cousin. From the novel's dawn, these colors are woven into the tapestry of his prose. Daisy and Jordan, adrift in their alabaster world, are first glimpsed in the glow of white. In this world, everyone dons this spectral hue: Nick's attire is of white flannels at Gatsby's revelry, Tom's shirt is the color of purity as he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's visage is powdered to a milky pallor. Yet, in moments where Gatsby's world unfurls its gaudy splendor, the halls are awash with the clamor of primary colors. \n\nFitzgerald defines these shades further, painting the ordinary with strokes of white and gray. As Nick melds into the city's rhythms, he descends into the white chasms that carve New York. Gatsby's guests are reduced to gray names inked upon Nick's ledger. Catherine's abode is but a slice of white cake, a testament to uniformity. The world of the mundane is draped in these colors: Jordan and Daisy's past as white as their girlhood, the valley's cars and land as gray as the ashes they traverse, the child on the rails as gray as the old man who sells dogs.\n\nThrough this spectrum, Fitzgerald weaves meaning, the colors becoming signposts of insignificance and conformity. The tale of Daisy is one of such hues. Once the stage is set, Fitzgerald cloaks her in white, ensconced in a little white roadster. She is no longer flesh and blood but an ideal, a dream that Gatsby chases. This method extends further, casting Daisy in the gray haze of her fur collar, her essence distilled into a white dress as Tom and Gatsby's destinies collide.",
            "In the broad sweep of San Diego County, where the sun spills its light unceasingly over the earth, the land is rich with the fruits of labor. The earth under the sun bears forth tomatoes and citrus and the leafy greens of this world, squash and broccoli, herbs fragrant and wild, fruits of the trees that are peaches and lemons, berries red and dark, honey sweet as the day is long, and peppers that bite back against the tongue. This land is a cradle for organic bounty, the market ever hungry for its yield, with folk lining in wait for the harvest. Eggs and milk, too, find their place in this cornucopia. Farms invite the wanderer to witness their workings, to walk the land where birds wheel in the sky, to hike the paths that traverse these fields. The land, thus tended, yields its bounty both to the earth and to the hand of man, drawing upon the aid of government to foster life and create spaces for the traveler and the curious alike.\n\nIn the tilling of this earth lies more than mere sustenance; it lies a testament to life untouched by the chemical scourge. The soil and the water drink deep of life, untainted, and so the creatures of the earth flourish, the plants burgeon in green profusion. Yet, the way of the organic farmer is not easy. The labor is great and the toil is without end, for the pests and the weeds do not yield their ground easily, nor does the soil grow rich by itself. It is the work of hands and backs and sweat that brings forth life here. The small farm cannot claim the efficiencies of the mighty, and so the costs may rise like the sun itself. There are practices that call for yet more sweat, the planting of cover crops, the wise grazing of beasts, the removal of the alien invaders, the careful tending to the growth of plants to make a home for the wild things, to create spaces where the land breathes freely. It is here a landowner may seek the counsel of those who know, may seek aid to balance the ledger between profit and life.\n\nThe land chosen for this tale lies near Potrero, in the unclaimed stretches of San Diego County, California. It is a place of 160 acres where chaparral meets the Mediterranean grassland, where oak trees stand sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. In the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan holds sway, the land is both history and promise. The plan, still in its making, watches over a hundred species, some slipping towards the edge of night, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like the burrowing owl, hold fast yet may soon falter.\n\nThis land, long watched by the eyes of those who came before, bears the memory of Native hands and the settlers who followed with their cattle and their axes in the late 1800s. It was once part of a homestead, a place of grazing and woodcutting in the years that have passed like a river beneath the bridge of time. I took this piece from the offerings of the modern marketplace and sought the wisdom of government programs, to see what might be done by a farmer with a mind for the land and its creatures. In my search, I found an organic farm near this place, a beacon for what might be achieved upon this earth.",
            "There was a tether between the brothers, a tether woven from the threads of time and blood, a binding that could not be severed by the hands of men nor the decrees of the heavens. Within this tether lay the full spectrum of human emotion—love that burned like a fever, pride that swelled like the tide, jealousy that festered like a wound, and cruelty that struck like a serpent. Brothers they were, understanding each other in a way that was beyond the reckoning of those outside their circle, seeing in each other's eyes the mirror of their own souls. It was in the crucible of crisis that this bond was truly revealed, whether in light or shadow, whether in grace or in ruin. When the veil of emotions lifted, they brought with them a heavy toll. To reckon with the emotions that sprang from this fraternal connection was to accept the weight of their consequences. When a man can look his brother in the eye and see his own reflection staring back, he sees himself not as the world perceives him, but as he is in the stark and unyielding light of truth. It is in the deeds of men and the fallout of those deeds that the measure of their character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" the tale of two brothers unfolds, exploring this theme and the tempest of emotion that accompanies it. Across a land painted with a lush and vivid brush, these two boys embark on a journey doomed to fail. Bitter disappointment crashes against fierce pride in their final reckoning, and only one brother walks away from the wreckage. The theme is woven through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their mutual engagements, as well as through the storyteller’s lens, which reveals the intricate emotions felt by the protagonist and his perception of the world, each a potent force shaping his deeds.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions could be distilled into a singular emotion: pride. From the moment he and his frail brother, Doodle, ventured forth together to their last, fatal venture, he harbored a resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother, one to whom he could impart all the skills he had gleaned from the world, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a rival to race to Horsehead Landing, a companion to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. Such dreams were rendered futile by Doodle’s fragile state, born with a heart so weak that survival seemed a distant hope. The prospect of him ever engaging in the robust endeavors of youth was all but dashed. What a cruel blow to the young protagonist, whose head was brimming with wild dreams, to have them shattered so abruptly. Indeed, he even harbored a dark anger towards the frail child, recalling how he once contemplated snuffing out his life with a pillow. What kind of child, indeed, would harbor thoughts of such finality? Yet, when the small child smiled, his heart softened. This simple act kindled a flicker of hope within him, revealing that his resolve was perhaps never as firm as he believed. Deep within, he harbored an innate love for his brother.",
            "In the vast expanse of the mind, there dwells an intricate engine of thought, a creation of complexity and creativity beyond measure. As the world of man evolved from the crude to the sophisticated, so too did the metaphors that sought to capture the essence of this cerebral labyrinth. Once likened to a waxen tablet, then to the papyrus scroll, and to the tome, and now to the very machines we craft to mirror our own intellect. Yet these comparisons, they fall short, like shadows on the cavern wall, leading the unwary to false reckonings.\n\nThe dance of information begins with the senses, those portals to the world, transforming the touch of the earth, the warmth of the sun, the whisper of the wind, and the light of the heavens into the language of the brain, a symphony of electrochemical signals. This sensory tapestry is woven through the algorithms of the mind, a ceaseless interplay of bottom-up and top-down reckoning. Consider the gaze upon a black box set against the purity of white. The primal process discerns the hues, the edges, the shapes, where one shade yields to another, declaring the presence of a form. Yet it is the higher mind that names it a box, not a void in the white, drawing upon the judgments of the simpler mind to hasten its recognition.\n\nOnce the mind has labored over this raw tapestry, there comes a sentinel of attention, weighing the worth of each signal, deciding which shall pass to the deeper realms of thought. Though your gaze may fall upon every blade in the green sea at your feet, a vigilant filter spares you the burden of counting each one. Yet, amidst the clamor, the whisper of your own name will still find you. At each stage, the mind's journey is guided and altered by the force of attention.\n\nFor the mind to reckon with the world, it must gather and hold what it learns. There are many chambers of memory: the fleeting, the present, the enduring. First, it encodes, each sense its own scribe. Words may be etched by their shape, their sound, or their meaning. Once gathered, these memories must be kept. The workings of memory, like echoes in a canyon, suggest that the brief span of working memory is held aloft by a loop of electric current through a neural path. Long-term memory, it is said, resides in the very fabric of proteins, enduring as the mountains endure.\n\nTheories abound as to how the mind arranges its knowledge, drawn from the way men recall their past, from the logic of machines, from the study of the brain itself. The model of the semantic web speaks of nodes and lines, each concept a star in a constellation, each linked by the gravity of meaning. A chair might lead to a table, and from there to wood, a journey of thought mapped by the mind's own hand.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself ensnared in the unrelenting grip of a financial cataclysm. Unemployment rose like a specter from the depths, the housing market collapsed with the weight of its own folly, and the great pillars of American commerce lay shattered in the dust. This recession, like a shadow that refuses to depart at dawn, lingers still, and so we stand at the precipice of inquiry: how did this calamity come to pass, and by what means might we avert its return? In essence, this financial tempest was born of avarice and the blind machinations of politics, which drove banks and corporations to dispense sub-prime loans into an already fragile and unripe financial terrain. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to gather and reshape these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered, unable to meet their dues, the banks found themselves bereft of reserves, and this chaos spilled forth onto the restructured mortgages they had traded, and onward into the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this crisis stretch back to the year 1999, in the time of President Clinton, as he sought to extend his dominion with a second term. In pursuit of favor, the Clinton administration loosened the shackles on lending, unwittingly setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times in that fateful year, observed, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, faces mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and feels the weight of shareholder demands to sustain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes foresaw the storm on the horizon, warning, \"But the government-backed corporation may encounter peril in an economic downturn, leading to a government intervention akin to the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.\" As we have seen, and as Holmes foretold, such reckless lending heralded the downfall of the economy.\n\nA confluence of factors conspired to cast the economy into disarray, not least among them the intricate and novel architecture of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and their kin, collateralized debt obligations, were wielded with abandon in the years preceding the crisis, binding more and more sectors of the economy to the vicissitudes of the housing market. Thus were U.S. households, and financial markets writ large, ensnared and overextended in the housing arena, leaving them perilously exposed to even the slightest tremors in price.\n\nAnd so it was that the housing bubble burst, and the financial titans who had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of America reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the rigors of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken into the embrace of government control by September of 2008.",
            "In those spaces where stories unfurl, there's a place where the writer might think to soar, to cast forth with words that glint like distant stars. Yet, there lies the danger of losing one's audience to slumber or indifference, a hazard well known to those like Dr. Merlin who have railed against the tyranny of overwritten exposition. Here, exposition is no ally.\n\nThe wise reader is no stranger to the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet still, Dr. Merlin stumbles into those vast deserts of narrative where movement ceases, or worse, overwhelms. Exposition's the whispering fiend urging you to thrust the history aside, to clear the path to the heart of the matter, though it mustn't be confused with the other devil that tempts the author to recount every minute of a character's infancy.\n\nExposition is the art of telling, a simple laying out of facts. In the realm of cinema, it is akin to a character unburdening their mind with tales as dense as \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who bears this task.\n\nPicture this: in the tale you read, the heroine's path is traced to the moment she met her beloved, to their wedding in grand style, to the day he fell before her eyes, murdered. You wouldn't expect this tale to be confined to two scant pages, where dialogue is sparse between them. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's soul, revealing through his words and deeds the depths of his love. Equally, you'd expect the heroine to manifest in her actions the profound changes his presence wrought, especially if his very existence is to be touted as transformative. Such introduction would bind you to his fate, opening a window to the heroine's world: her vision of him, the depth of their union, her dreams mirrored in his gaze, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, tethered more closely to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your charge to flesh out this frame. (*casts a weary eye upon the metaphor, yet presses on*) There's a pull to glide over certain truths. Perhaps you’re unveiling a new figure, a man once of the Air Force, now the keeper of a night watch at a gas station, twice wed without children, a fisherman on idle days, nurturing a quiet hope to own that station, his morning spent with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the flickering screen and watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, two broadcasts that bore the weight of the world's grief in their telling. The first, live from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011, spoke of a grim tale from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, her name unspoken amidst the chaos of it all. His likeness filled the screen, a visage marked by malice. They lingered but a couple of minutes on this tale, for it was still unfolding, the man had been caught, and she was left with wounds unnumbered. It seemed the time given was sufficient for what was known.\n\nThe next tale brought forth the image of Travis Buyers, just eighteen, who had met with gunfire in the early hours at Sharon Woods. Critically wounded he lay, while the city waited for justice unsought, no men in chains, no face marked by guilt. The SWAT team prowled the shadows of the crime. Yet the story was brief, and in that brevity lay a truth unspoken, for he was a black man in a world that often turned its gaze away. The media, ever eager for tales of white children lost or found, seemed to hush when it was a darker skin that suffered.\n\nThen there was talk of a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter, the small .22 caliber bullet that had marred its surface. The tale was spun with details of place and time, and Crime-Stoppers held forth the promise of five thousand dollars for the soul who could lead them to the one who pulled the trigger.\n\nThe rains were coming, storms in the afternoon, they said, temperatures hovering in the eighties through the weekend. The story, brief as it was, served as a lure to keep eyes fixed upon them.\n\nThere was mention of a robbery, a dark-skinned man with a hoodie at Clime Road UDF, six feet and a hundred fifty pounds of shadow and intent. It was curious, the time they spent on the shade of his skin, the darkness of his being.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a man of Texas, a kingpin of drugs, caught in the act of moving his wares into Ohio. They spoke of his sentence, twenty-five years or three hundred months, the latter perhaps meant to sound more severe. They noted his Hispanic roots, though it seemed a detail more for color than for truth.",
            "In the vast and winding corridors of finance, where shadows of figures flicker across the walls like specters, there exists a thing called an ETF. This creature, an exchange traded fund, is a security crafted to follow the path of an index, a commodity, or a gathering of assets akin to an index fund, yet it bears the agility of a stock, trading on the open market with the ease of a drifting cloud. It offers the breadth of an index fund, the singularity of a lone stock, and the power to sell short, to buy on the margin, to possess a solitary share if that is all one seeks. The allure is undeniable, and the expense ratios whisper lower than those of the average mutual fund. But there are always costs, and in this case, the fee of commission on trades, as inevitable as the rising sun. \n\nThe beauty of ETFs lies in their multitude, a myriad of funds laid out like stars in the night sky. Yet the wise investor treads carefully, ever questioning if the proclaimed virtues hold true, if diversification is but a mirage in the desert of speculation. Here, we cast our gaze upon the ETF known as IHF, measuring it against the ten stones that form its foundation, seeking to discern if the ownership of this single entity rivals the bounty of a diversified portfolio, or if a finer arrangement of these ten might yield richer returns and a more favorable sharpe ratio.\n\nTo sift through every holding would be a task for Sisyphus, and thus we limit our scope to the top ten, these ten accounting for a majority of the ETF's essence. With these, we attempt to mirror the ETF, their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return laid bare as if by the light of a harsh dawn.\n\nThe numbers speak with a clarity that belies their complexity. A portfolio of these ten outstrips the ETF by 6.11% in returns, a gain of 16%. The Beta, a measure of their volatility, whispers lower by .12. Yet the question lingers like smoke in still air, whether the means of these two creatures truly differ in the eyes of the cold, indifferent statistics.\n\nTo seek the truth, we grasp at the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a common scale, a hundred percent, comparing their collective uncertainty to that of the ETF IHF. And there, in the cold calculus of numbers, lies the answer, waiting to be unearthed by those with eyes to see.",
            "In the cold months when the year wanes and the land lies under snow, the logs of those who move by foot or wheel to that New England campus fell away like leaves from a tree. It is a hard thing to say exactly why this was, but surely the chill of winter played a part. In December, the old semester’s end comes down like a curtain, and folk are burdened with tasks that press upon them, leaving little room for the writing of logs and such like. A season of holidays follows, where the world falls silent and still, and the school itself seems to draw breath as students scatter far and wide. When January rolls around, there’s a stirring again, a sense of something waking, but even then, the logs remain few. February, too, offers no explanation for the dearth that lingers. It is the nature of things to begin with vigor, then wane, and so we sought to light a fire anew with the Carpool Challenge Week come March, a swift campaign that brought some life back to the endeavor. Yet the real test lay in keeping that spark alive against the cold reality of breaks and holidays that come with the world of learning.\n\nAnd there’s the rub, for the heart of man yearns for the open road, the promise of freedom that sits behind the wheel of a car. It is a thing woven deep in the fabric of our lives. To coax folks toward a different path, we offered prizes, small treasures from the world nearby—a meal, a coffee, a book from the shop on the corner. But it is a thought that lingers, what might have been with grander prizes, a fine bicycle, perhaps, or even a car that whispers of the future with its silent engine. The prizes we gave did not change with the turning of the year, steady as the stars above, but had we in December whispered of bicycles, or in January of cars, who can say how many more might have come to join us, how much brighter the logs might have burned against the winter’s night.",
            "In the dusty halls of the Library of Congress, I wandered through the vaults of early Edison films, drawn to the flickering shadows of trick films that spanned the years from 1895 to 1901. Fifteen in number, these celluloid phantoms employed the sorcery of creative editing, weaving illusions that danced before the eye. My journey through this spectral archive was one of unraveling the poetics that lay hidden in the fabric of these films, tracing the thread of their evolution, and noting the peculiarities that marked the outliers of their kind. The trick films of that bygone era were shackled to the stage, their scenes framed within the confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, captured long and medium shots, adhering to a rigid creed of one shot equaling one film. Yet, as the century turned, some dared to breach the established order, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nWhat binds these trick films in common is their tether to an interior world, bound by the proscenium's embrace. The camera, like an unblinking sentinel, remains fixed, refusing to trail figures or objects beyond its ordained station. This composition, a vestige of theatre and the vaudevillian spectacle of magic acts, constrains the movement of figures to a horizontal dance, denying them the liberty to advance or retreat from the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors slip in from the right, shuffling along the horizontal plane, vanishing beyond the frame as the camera holds its ground, indifferent to their departure.\n\nIn this proscenium-bound world, the shots stretch long, seldom breaking into medium. The intimacy of a close-up is a stranger here, for in the tradition of theatre and vaudeville, the audience beholds the entirety of the scene, bordered by the stage's edge. In the early days of film, actors remained distant, anchored in the middle ground, and the lens sought no intimacy with their visage.\n\nThese early trick films are bound by a singular notion: one conceptual shot for each film. This constraint clips their length to a minute or less, dictated by the flickering frames per second. The narrative scope is similarly curtailed, relegated to short bursts of vaudeville magic, disappearing acts, and sleight of hand, with scant regard for story. Yet, the viewer's eye may be deceived, for what seems a solitary shot may, in truth, be a tapestry of cuts, stitched together to conjure the illusion of apparitions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), scrutiny reveals the juncture where Mary's severed \"head\" appears, exposing the cunning artifice behind what is perceived as a single, seamless shot.",
            "In the strange alchemy of words and time there exists a curious creature known as the Gothic novel, an odd confluence of old and new that Ian Watt in his musings named an oxymoron. This Gothic mode, much like the weathered stones of ancient castles, has endured the lashings of both disdain and praise. Its depths questioned and yet within its shadows lies the sublime terror that Burke spoke of. When Horace Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, it was as if he grasped the ancient and the modern in his hand and forged a new path through the dark forests of literature. He took the old theater with its echoes and ghosts and the new mimicry of nature that novels had just begun to explore, and he wove them into what he called \"A Gothic Story.\" This genre, with its nods to medieval theatre and architecture, to traditions long buried, stood as an anachronism even then. The very word \"gothic\" had wandered through history, applied to many peoples and styles, and was often seen as something archaic, a relic in the face of modernity. Yet it is this mingling of the theatrical and the novel’s intimate exploration of the human mind that allows the Gothic to linger, to be both ancient and novel to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nThere is a notion that runs deep through the Gothic, like a river beneath the earth, and that is the idea of chivalry. In the medieval times chivalry was the making of a knight, a process both sacred and severe, and it is in The Castle of Otranto that this ideal is both preserved and transformed. Gothic writers clung to this chivalric code, for it spoke of bravery and honor, of knights who stood as bastions of a decency they feared had vanished from the world. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of political upheaval, looked to the past with a longing that bled into his writing. In those tales, the Gothic past became a romantic vision, a dream of what might mend the fractures of the present. Amidst the shadows of his own despair, he saw society as a thing unwound, its innate goodness gone astray. His characters, like Frederic, are painted with the hues of chivalry, though they walk in the twilight of Gothic excess. Frederic, a prince marred by tragedy and thought lost to the infidels, embodies the chivalric ideal. He stands as a figure of gallantry, exaggerated in his virtues, embodying the very excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic. A knight caught between the echoes of the past and the creeping shadows of the new world.",
            "In the vast machinery of commerce, there exists a flow unbroken, a great passage of goods from the moment a customer dreams a need to the time that need is met. This is the realm called supply chain management, a term first uttered in 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man who saw the world as a map of connections yet to be drawn. He spoke of the planning and the controlling, a dance of elements all in service to the customer's fleeting desires. Six elements, he said. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the bones of the enterprise, the sinews that draw the world closer.\n\nProduction is the first of those bones, the great foundation upon which all else is built. It is here the questions are asked: when and why, where and how. The managers, those stewards of industry, must discern the whispers of the market, that vast indicator of human wants. And when they have peered into the depths and understood, they decide what shall be born and how much. The place of its birth follows, a decision of plant and field, always with an eye to what the customer will bear. And when the place is known, they set to the work, scheduling and maintaining, for production is a fragile thing, a step in the chain that must be hewn with care. If it falters, the company may find itself adrift, time and money lost to the winds. I once walked the aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, places where every detail is a gospel, every process a script. The employee's garb, the trucks that bring the goods. All are known, all are ordered, so the company might move without falter, without doubt.\n\nThe second bone is supply, a thing of strategic choices. Here the manager must look to the facility, to the partners that might be drawn from the world beyond. A single product may be born in many places, each with its own tools and hands. The manager must choose wisely, decide where the task will best be done. Perhaps they will look to others, to the companies beyond, for in the end, it is velocity they seek. That balance of speed and quality, of cost kept low, a fine dance to satisfy the insatiable hunger of the market.",
            "The novels of the Victorian age, with their intricate tapestries of detail and their homage to the nobility of their time, often stand as monuments to a world both richly adorned and rigidly ordered. Yet, within this era, there are tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that wander from the path, bearing a cloak of mystery and a taste for the peculiar that sets them apart. These stories delve into the shadowed corners of the human soul, where secrets dwell and the bizarre finds a home, crafting characters whose depths are laid bare in a dance of motives and emotion.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the cloak of mystery often takes form through dreams or the haze of dreamlike states, each revealing its own truth. In Oliver Twist, such visions serve as a window into Oliver's soul, unveiling the shadows that torment him and his growing awareness of the grim realities that encircle him. When the echoes of gunfire revisit Oliver in the twenty-eighth chapter, the memory colors his mind with the vividness of a dream, casting him adrift in a struggle for salvation. The scene lays bare the absence of command he holds over his fate and reflects the frailty of his existence, the phantoms of Sikes and Crackit haunting his fevered mind. The gunshot reverberates through him, a cacophony of senses dulled, as he is swept away by invisible hands; his despair becomes a familiar companion, not born of sudden pain but a constant specter tethered to fear. Herein lies the question of whose hand guides his sorrow, for it is not his own. The shooting stands as testament to the helplessness that binds Oliver, an acceptance creeping into his soul, as if the sinister influence of old Fagin were etching its mark upon him, whispering despair into his ear, dulling his will to fight. For surely, if the spirit within him still burned bright, he would have grasped for some semblance of control, if only to preserve his own fragile life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "In the years past, I found myself in the company of young minds at an after school program. These were children of elementary age, seeking guidance in the tangled thicket of their studies. I offered what aid I could, though my hand was surest in the realms of English and reading. It was there that I crossed paths with a young boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps the third or fourth grade, who found himself wading through the murky waters of literacy. The peculiarities of his struggle were not lost on me. Some letters he grasped as if they were old friends, others eluded him entirely. It was the damnedest thing. He was of Latino descent, of this I was certain, yet the boy spoke the English tongue with the ease of any native. We wrestled with his troubles for a time, until providence saw fit to introduce me to his mother. On a day when I lingered with a few stragglers while their peers gallivanted on a field trip, she appeared. Her speech was of the Spanish variety, my own knowledge of which was patchwork at best. Yet in our stilted exchange, clarity emerged as though from a fog. Adrian's struggle was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet, a revelation that struck me as if I'd been blindsided. Whether this insight served him in the end, I cannot say. But I hold hope that he fares better now.\n\nThis tale I recount is but a thread in the vast tapestry of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in the sun-drenched expanse of California. It stands as testament to the hidden nature of such obstacles. A child may speak English with the fluency of water over stone, yet reading it may prove a formidable mountain. We acknowledge the existence of this barrier, but what course do we chart to surmount it? For Adrian, the path was straightforward—tutoring in the basics of English reading, the alphabet, the sounds that comprise it. Yet for those children who find themselves adrift, scarcely speaking the language at all, the solution is a labyrinth. No singular remedy can bind this wound. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL instruction—none alone will suffice. The answer lies in a symphony of these approaches.\n\nConsider first the dual language system, an idea ripe with promise. Not solely for those whose first breath was drawn in Spanish, but for all children. “Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outshine their peers academically.” Fear clings to this notion, a specter of wasted resources, of the majority gaining naught. Yet such fears are unfounded. Were we to weave these programs into the fabric of every classroom, the benefits would be a shared bounty. How then do we proceed? Must we demand that all who teach be versed in two tongues? No, such a demand would be folly. But there is no reason we cannot enlist bilingual aides, tutors, those who can bridge the chasm.",
            "From the time we are children most of us are told of that which lies beyond the compass of our understanding, a vastness in the world that dwarfs our small and flickering lives. Some are shepherded to Sunday school to seek it out, others find their way to Temple, or delve into the deep recesses of their own souls for answers. Many among us take up the mantle of faith passed down from our forebears, like old garments worn without question. But there are those who cast off such garments, defiant in their belief of a universe centered solely upon their own being. We might embrace one creed only to barter it for another in due time. Whatever path we tread upon, it is a journey to etch our own mark upon the stone of existence, to seek out a glimmer in the dark that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favored bird. We sat on our porch as the rain drummed against the tin roof above, the smoke from our shared cigarettes curling into the moist air. The gutters spewed torrents that drowned the plants clinging to the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, caught between seeking and remembering. He had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack from his frame, hair thinning to a sparse memory. His gaze stayed fixed on the rain, avoiding mine, and I sat there feeling alone and afraid, words unspoken between us about how much I would miss him, for to speak them would make them real. I hugged him then, and drew my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the dimming light of June's end.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days after I marked my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation had done little but prolong his suffering past the bounds of what the doctors had foreseen; what worth lay in the extension of pain I could not fathom. I questioned then the nature of a God who might allow such things. Alone in the night, I found no prayers upon my lips. If God was, then He had turned His ear from me long ago.\n\nI did not wish to see him pass from this life to whatever lay beyond. And so I did not. I could not bear to witness the ending of the life that had given me life. I wished to hold in memory the man as he had lived, not as he had died. Besides, I knew him better than they, better than kin or kith, and knew he would not want his child to watch as he slipped away. I lay curled in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nBut no word came.",
            "In the quiet lands of Caroline, there walked a man named John Taylor, whose soul was bound to the soil and his heart to the creed of Republicanism. He was not merely a tiller of the land but a voice that rose above the furrows, speaking with fervor of liberty and governance. His life’s work in the earth and his fleeting dance with politics forged in him a steadfastness, a clarity in the discourse of freedom. The fields he tended became the bedrock of his beliefs, and from this ground, he cast his gaze upon the machinery of power, where he saw the virtue in an agrarian society. It was this vision that painted his views on sovereignty, on the Constitution, and even upon the courts of justice.\n\nJohn Taylor beheld the new nation with eyes unclouded by ancient custom, seeing therein a canvas untouched, whereupon an ideal governance might be wrought. He was a stalwart believer in the natural rights of man, each a thread in the fabric of liberty, where to sever one was to fray them all and leave the whole diminished. These rights, he argued, must remain beyond the grasp of governance. He spoke of what some called the \"state of nature,\" a realm where the strong and the cunning held sway, but within civilization, this must not hold.\n\nTo conjure forth this ideal realm, Taylor held that a government must reckon with the duality within man, a creature of both light and shadow. He was unyielding in his view of this moral dualism, declaring, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He discerned good principles as those that shielded private property, nurtured the land, and cast a wary eye upon the rise of capital. Such a government, grounded in righteousness, would stand fair, its administration inevitably driven by greed and self-gain. Yet, he saw self-interest not as a sin, save when it birthed societies that thrived on the toil of others. A government of good must cage man's inherent darkness, ever watched lest it be twisted by ill principles.\n\nTaylor, like the Republicans of his age, demanded the Constitution be held to its letter, its bounds tightly drawn around the Federal reach. He foresaw tyranny’s shadow in a sprawling Federal power and knew its cost was freedom. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading, for without the spirit of its makers, such interpretation could turn foul. More than this, he held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter, for it named the union as sovereign states bound together, not as one singular nation.",
            "He stood there, eyes cast downward, the mind a barren plain. The view before him held in its silent embrace, dissected by that practiced scrutiny which sees but does not bind itself to the intangible. Thoughts drifted through like smoke on a wind, vanishing as soon as they formed. The workings of his mind so seamless they seemed not his own, but a flowing encounter with the scene laid bare before his eyes.\n\nOnce, there was an artist who spoke of a book. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, it was called, a guide to seeing and rendering the world anew. The book spoke of frames, of narrowing the vast to the simple, of reducing the cluttered tableau of the world—a bowl of fruit in a kitchen that opened to a dining room—to the mere essence of a bowl resting upon a plain. Yet here, in this moment, he could not summon such a frame. Overwhelmed, he stood captive to the sight, a witness to his own wonder. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Renaissance its kaleidoscope. And here, if his view were to claim the mantle of Art, would be his own magnum opus. The genesis of Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips found the chosen tool of his craft, muscles tensing and releasing as his hand traversed the air, intent made flesh in what could have been his most creative hour. The water swirled, serene as a mountain stream, clear as the morning light. Bits of matter broke free, swept away into oblivion. Muscles tightened anew, urgency flaring in the second attempt, as his hand struck the lever of the toilet once more. Yet the stubborn brown mass clung, unmoved, defiant as a rooted thing.\n\nWith mop in hand, feet set in their appointed stance, green tie knotted tight against his throat, he frowned at the insolent bundle of waste left behind by some heedless soul. A few more flushes, a few moments' meditative quiet, then his hand reached for the paper on the wall, wrapping itself until it wore the guise of a baker's mitt. Straightening, then bending, his hand dipped into the bowl, slow and deliberate, like a mother reaching into the oven for Thanksgiving's feast.",
            "In the dry and sunbaked stretches of highway, where the horizons are endless and the road winds like a serpent through the desolate land, young souls are claimed by the asphalt. A convergence of misfortune and folly marks the path of the youngest who steer these machines of steel and glass. The National Institutes of Health speaks of the unripe mind, a mind not yet honed to the perils that crouch in the shadows of driving. And it is this lack of weathered experience that lies coiled at the heart of their misfortune. It breeds not only ruinous wrecks but sends them hurtling off the road, overturning their vessels, and hurtling into the void.\n\nWhen they ride with their ilk, the folly compounds. A truth known to any who have crossed paths with the young and reckless. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare a grim equation: the age of the passenger and the tally of calamities incurred.\n\nIn lands like California, they have sought to weave a net of safety for these fledgling drivers with provisional licenses that bind them to the hours and the company they keep. Yet these measures, in my reckoning, are but patches on a wound that bleeds. For the youngest, by all accounts, are not yet steeled to the demands thrust upon them. Marvin Zuckerman, a man of study into the mind's wild inclinations, believes even eighteen summers is too few for such a burden. USA Today echoes his findings, the young driven by a lust for the sensation of risk. Better, then, to stay their hands from the wheel till the fire within cools to embers.\n\nShould we persist in granting leave to the young to roam the roads, the tally of the fallen will rise to a grievous height. The children of the Baby Boomers stand at the ready, millions poised to take the wheel. The year 2010 will see a tide of young drivers loosed upon the thoroughfares.\n\nTo address this, the path is clear. Let the schools sow the seeds of knowledge for those who will one day drive, yet hold the keys from hands under eighteen. Let provisional permits be given, with training cut from the cloth of the state's requirements—California asks six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice.\n\nThe grim statistics do not heed borders. Thus, a law drawn across the nation, uniform and unwavering, could be the shield we need for our youth. This notion is not new, but in the light of what looms, it is a course both wise and just.",
            "In the vast and silent corridors of the mind where sound should find its meaning, there lies a disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a specter that shadows the pathways of the brain, where the central nervous system wrestles with the whispers of the world, unable to decipher them as it should. In this paper, we tread through three territories of this enigmatic condition. We begin with a definition that seeks to capture its elusive nature. We then delve into the realm of diagnosis, marking the telltale signs that betray its presence. Finally, we journey to the classroom, where a teacher stands as a beacon for those students adrift in the sea of sound.\n\nThe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in one of its many reckonings, described CAPD as the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system employs auditory information. A disorder not of the ears but of the mind's translation, where the common sounds of life become a cacophony without a guide. These individuals hear the world as it is, yet the compass of their mind falters, unable to distinguish the vital from the trivial, the spoken word from the ambient noise.\n\nIts origins trace back to the mid-1950s, a time when the disorder was but a whisper called \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, like the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began their quest in 1954, seeking to illuminate the shadows cast by communicative disorders in children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, a novel attempt to map the uncharted territories of the auditory pathways. In 1977, a gathering of minds further fanned the flames of inquiry into the lives of children burdened by CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as they are subtle. Those afflicted may wander through a soundscape with no landmarks, unable to locate or discern sound amidst the din. They may struggle to separate the sounds of life, to hear the music in the noise, the words in the wind. Their world may lack the harmony of recognition, the melody of change, the rhythm of sequence. The disorder blocks and distorts, leaving them adrift in a sea of sounds that refuse to coalesce into meaning.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD is to embark on a quest through the labyrinth of sound. It requires the keen eyes and ears of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others who wield their tools and tests like explorers mapping unknown lands. Questionnaires and observations are their compasses, guiding them through the auditory behaviors of the patient. Yet, as of now, no single tool can claim victory over the disorder, no singular cause has been unearthed. The tests, varied and complex, present the patient with a symphony of stimuli, seeking to tease out the patterns hidden within. More advanced measures delve deeper, recording the echoes within the ear, measuring the mind's response to this unseen symphony.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and a path unformed, I find myself drawn towards the realm of social work with the Division of Family and Children Services. There, I seek to mend the lives of children scarred by abuse or neglect and to offer solace to families lost in turmoil. The values I carry into this calling are not mere principles of the trade but are etched into my very being—service, respect, a moral compass unwavering, a dedication to bridge the chasms between souls, and a vow to hone my craft so as never to falter in my duty. These are not just tenets of a social worker; they are the cornerstones of my life.\n\nFrom the days of my youth, the urge to lend aid was a constant whisper, yet the road ahead lay shrouded in mist. In the halls of my schooling, both high and higher, I watched as many turned their backs on their shadows, and some clung to crutches unworthy of their weight. It was in these moments, these glimpses into the struggles of others, that I chose a path towards a Bachelor's in Psychology. Still, the destination eluded me, and so after my time at Piedmont College came to its natural end in 2009, I paused. That summer, a chance encounter with a boy of sixteen, perched uneasily on a friend's couch, set my course. Fleeing from the tyranny of his own blood, he had sought refuge. On the morrow, the law was summoned to his kin's abode, and I followed, driven by an instinct to intervene. The officers, finding their hands bound by the letter of the law, bid me speak with the boy's parents, and I did. Their words were cloaked in nervousness and feeble excuses, painting their son's cries for help as mere manipulations. In that moment, the notion of social work grew roots within me, a resolve to aid those ensnared by the so-called \"simple\" disputes of kinship.\n\nJustice, too, beats at the heart of this vocation. In our society, we speak of the sanctity of the individual, yet our lamentations for the lost ring hollow, echoing traditions long past. If we truly mourn those who have departed, why then do we strive to mold ourselves in the likeness of others? I stand apart, unyielding, unwilling to don the chains of conformity. Through the years of my education, I railed against the injustices I encountered, be it through the colors in my hair, the fabric that clothed me, the piercings that adorned my skin, or my voice raised in alliance with those who dared to love freely. Against racism and discrimination, I have stood firm, and I shall continue to do so, for social justice is a cause I carry like a torch against the encroaching dark.",
            "In the dim corridors of human understanding, there lies the study of sleep and its many troubles. Insomnia, that persistent thief of rest, finds itself examined through the lenses of both biology and the tangled web of sociocultural influences. The biological path winds through the genetic landscapes, where the shadows of inheritance and the cold, clinical truths of medicine dwell. Meanwhile, the sociocultural path meanders through the interactions of environment, the unyielding constructs of race and class, and the burdens of demographic circumstance. This paper seeks to illuminate these paths, drawing upon the flickering candlelight of research to guide the way. Each study, like a stone in a riverbed, is turned over to reveal both its polished strengths and its hidden flaws.\n\nIn the realm of sleep's disorders, they are marked by primary afflictions or as symptoms tethered to deeper mental disturbances, or perhaps as shadows cast by other maladies. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, these are the names given to nightmares and waking terrors that haunt the night. Primary Insomnia, a restless foe that denies the comfort of sleep, stands opposed to Primary Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a distant shore. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into dream, and the rhythm of circadian disarray, all find their places in this litany of sleep's disorders. Parasomnias, with their spectral behaviors and strange physiological tales, recount nightmares and sleepwalks that traverse the boundaries of the conscious and unconscious. \n\nThe whisperings of the biological model speak of neurons and chemical messengers, the language of genes and heritable shadows. In the hypothalamus, where orexin neurons hold court, the balance of sleep and wakefulness is struck. Studies with mice, those silent witnesses to human inquiry, reveal the presence of GABAB receptors on these neurons, guardians of sleep states. The GABAA receptor, when stirred to life, calls forth the balm of sleep, while its silence begets restlessness. Such findings, though born in the minds of mice, suggest truths that may echo in the human form. \n\nYet, the sociocultural voice cannot be stilled. It murmurs of inherited phenotypes and the societal weights that press upon the individual. Should the receptors fail, the disturbance ripples outward, unsettling the delicate balance of life's pursuits. The classroom, the workplace, those spaces of mundane focus, all threatened by the restless nights. Thus, the disorder of insomnia is not merely a biological aberration but a reflection of the broader human condition, a testament to the intricate dance of genes and society.",
            "I have wandered these grounds at University Park for some two and a half years now. The semesters, four and a half in their passage. The campus sprawls wide and the journey across it is a trial for many, myself tangled among them. In the first year of my stay they placed me in a dorm by East Halls, near as far east as the campus will let you wander unless you count the vastness of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. From Stuart Hall, my abode, to the distant halls of Willard, situated near the heart of this academic sprawl, could take up to twenty-five minutes by foot, longer if the skies turned foul as they often do in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time not long past when East Halls sat bordered by vast, empty lands. Now those tracts are filled with sports fields and looming edifices, the new Creamery and the health services building rising among them, hemmed in by apartments. As the campus stretches ever outward, the passage from one corner to another grows more arduous. And what remedy might there be for such a plight? On these grounds, it is the bicycle that holds promise. Yet a bike alone is no panacea. Students must take to them, and the campus must bend to their needs.  \nA friend of mine, who took up cycling again after years adrift, spoke of his wonder at why he ever left it. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a time it seemed folly to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Not only does it serve the body well, but bicycling stands as the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oats and a bit of muscle will carry you thirty miles or more. Like many of my peers, I dwell off campus now, as distant from the heart of things as some dorms might be. This year, the wisest move I've made was to acquire a bike. Each day I must reach the Thomas building, a good twenty-five-minute walk from my door if by foot alone. With the bike, the time shrinks to a scant five minutes, provided I ride with purpose. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas, is not always an easy way, bike or no. There is merit in walking too, but I find my days too filled to afford it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach class. Such a trek to Thomas each day would steal an extra thirty to forty minutes from my hours. That's over two and a half hours lost to the week. And when you tally the time spent on foot to other classes and meetings and such, it becomes a cost too dear to pay.",
            "In the shadowed corridors of Huxley’s Brave New World, there lies a world both strange and familiar, where the faces of men and women are but reflections in a glass darkly. A world where the hum of machines and the whispers of commerce form a haunting litany, binding all who dwell there in a dance of hollow joy. It is a place where the soul of man is woven into the great loom of technology and capitalism, and in its weaving, finds itself undone. These folk, these denizens of a new epoch, are cradled from birth in the arms of a manufactured happiness, a balm for the spirit that seeks no deeper truth than the surface of things. \n\nHere, the game is played on a vast board, the pieces moved by unseen hands, the World Controller the architect of destinies not their own. The specter of Marx watches over this tableau, for in its unfolding, there is laid bare the suspicion of systems, the uneasy dream of progress. Terms of art, words like homogeny and reification, whisper of a time when the soul of man was not yet sold to the highest bidder, when the heart sought more than the promise of a new thing. \n\nThe satire is sharp, the critique unyielding. False consciousness, the mask worn by the multitudes, is the child of capitalism’s embrace. The people, tethered to their desires, are blind to the chains that bind them. Their world is one of consumption, of endless want, and in hypnopædia's lullaby, they find their singular truth. The World Controller, the puppet master, ensures that the dance continues, that hegemony remains unchallenged. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, move through life unaware, ensnared in a web they cannot see, their thoughts not their own. \n\nEven the Alphas and Betas live in the shadow of the machine, their awareness a burden they do not wish to carry. Bernard, one among few, glimpses the strings, but even he finds himself swept along in the current. In this world, the social order is a mirror, reflecting the iron grip of capitalism, the silent hand that shapes all things. \n\nThere is no love here, no true bond between souls, only the echo of what once was. Huxley paints his characters as if they are but phantoms, their depths unexplored, for perhaps in this, he speaks of a truth—that the rise of machine and market has stripped away the essence of man. The heart’s desires are but shadows, fleeting and insubstantial. Men speak of women as objects, their words devoid of warmth or connection, and the women, in turn, speak boldly of encounters as if they were transactions, devoid of feeling. \n\nThe classes are content, blind to the bars of their gilded cage, their obedience a testament to the power of the unseen hand. The proletariat, in their consuming, are bound to the wheel, deceived into believing they are more than they are. In their complacency, we see the mark of Marx’s thought, the echo of a warning unheeded, as they move through their days in a dance of obedience, never questioning, never straying from the path laid before them.",
            "It was near four years gone now that I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at the college. And there in the modest room with its linoleum floor and wooden desks, we argued the nature of the religion, whether it was hostile and its intentions dark, or if there was another truth to be seen. I reckon the question has only grown more pertinent with time's passage. Since the day the towers fell, I've watched the media's stance shift from one of open hostility toward Islam and its extremists, to a more bewildering tolerance. I’d wager that back in 2001, the notion of a man named Barack Obama, with ties to the Muslim faith, standing as a candidate for the presidency would have seemed far-fetched.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I’ve come to know it, is a tale that fascinates me for its contradictions. The history of Muhammad, as I understood it, painted him as a conqueror, one who bent tribes to his will and demanded their submission to Islam. Yet the biography speaks of a martyr, misunderstood, humble in his dealings. People, so it is written, came to him of their own accord, drawn to the truth he preached.\n\nThere’s a curious likeness in the ministries of Jesus and the fabled acts of Muhammad. The most striking is the tale of the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. Such narratives lead me to suspect the writers intended to cast Muhammad in a light akin to a humble prophet, whose truth and miracles needed no defense. This, to my thinking, undermines the unique wonder of Christ’s life, as if they were pilfering the essence of Jesus to bolster Muhammad.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts that aim to show how folks, seemingly unbidden, found their way to Islam. Yet these tales often come from second or third-hand sources, hearsay and whispers. The intention, I reckon, was to lend authenticity, but it only served to sow doubt, rendering the stories suspect in my eyes.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. History paints a starkly different picture, one not of gentleness but of power and conquest. And I can't help but wonder if those who follow Islam today are aware of the true history that shadows the Prophet’s ascent.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, where the echoes of ancient footsteps still whisper, there lies the tale of a man whose teachings were like seeds scattered upon the earth, only to be left behind by the hands that tilled the fields of thought thereafter. The man, Jesus, spoke of truths in a world now shadowed by its own interpretations, and as the years have unfurled, the path of Christianity has wandered far from its source. In the broad sweep of history, a pattern emerges—a journey away from beginnings, a divergence carried by the winds of time. Yet in the present age, there stirs an awakening, a burgeoning consciousness that tugs at the roots of what has been sown. The world, as it stands, bears witness to a shift, a swell of progress that seeks to unravel the tapestry back to its original threads.\n\nIn this landscape of change, there are those who cling to the old ways, steadfast in their inheritance. They form a bulwark, a resistance, but their numbers may falter against the tide of history. Among the faithful, an awareness blooms, a thirst to discern the essence of the faith from the accretions of doctrine amassed over epochs. This quest for purity may span decades, perhaps centuries, but its course seems set—the wheel of Christian history poised to turn back upon itself. A great movement shall rise, a tide that peels away the layers of time, as if reversing the very flow of the hourglass, until what remains is a vision of what once was, a return to the simplicity of a carpenter's voice echoing in the hills of Galilee.\n\nThis tide shall sweep through lands, from the heartlands of America to the old world of Europe, drawing the multitudes to a form of worship stripped of all but the essence. The church, a bastion upon the shifting sands, shall guide this return, yet with the reversal of the theological clock shall come a convergence, a harmony in belief and practice that erodes the divisions long held sacred. Where once there were chasms, there shall be bridges; where once there were countless voices, a singular song. History is a river marked by such reversions, and the chronicles of man are filled with them. Recall the days when the Roman Empire, mighty and unyielding, sought to quench the flame of Christianity, only to be consumed by it in turn. The passage from chains to leadership in the American saga tells of a similar arc.\n\nThe reversion that looms upon the horizon of faith will see history undone, a search for the source, a dissolution of diversity into unity. Central to this unfolding shall be a reading of Jesus’ words, not as rigid proclamations, but as metaphors, keys to unlock deeper truths. Thus, the question remains—what path has led us here, since the days when Jesus walked among us? \n\nLook back, far into the shadows of antiquity, and there stands Judaism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of Christianity was raised. Monotheism, the revelation divine, the authority of Hebrew scripture—these were the pillars when Rome took Jerusalem beneath its banner in 63 B.C.E. Yet even then, the Jewish soul was not singular. It fractured into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the multitude of the common folk, each with their own vision, their own truth.",
            "In the world Sinclair lays bare, there is a darkness in the human heart that speaks to greed as a natural law. The Jungle unfurls this truth with the relentless precision of a knife. Men scrabble through the bones of their own kind, seeking out the gold in marrow, eyes fixed only on their own horizon. The owners and masters of the roaring factories, these titans of industry, they are blind in their ambition. They see not the blood and smoke that rises to the heavens nor care for the souls crushed beneath their iron wheels. Sinclair writes of the monolithic structures, their silhouettes harsh against the sky, the smoke trailing to the world's edge. A testament to the cold heart of progress. He whispers of the filth that flows unchecked from the pens, a silent flood of waste that drowns the land.\n\nIn those days, the worth of a man was measured in dollars and cents, and a dollar he was not. \"A cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair calls it, a place where no shred of loyalty or decency remains. Men toil under the yoke of greed, hours stretching into the dim hours of night, only to be cast aside like husks without notice or recompense. Laws to shield them were scarce as water in a drought, leaving the workers to fend off the wolves alone, the managers urging them to the brink of ruin. The silence of suffering is deafening, the expectation that they endure the unendurable, the unsaid truth of their existence. No hand reaches out to lift them from their plight, no agency or soul to guide them through the wreckage. Unions rise and fall like dust, feeding off the laborers as surely as their masters. They are slaves in all but name, described by Sinclair as a people on the edge of starvation, bound to the whims of men as cruel as any slave driver of old. Immorality blooms in such soil, inevitable as weeds in an untended field.",
            "In the dim corridors of literature, where shadows linger and words echo, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the depths of man's imagination. Poe, in his craft, invokes the ancient term “Thulé,” a relic of Virgil's musings, a whisper of lands beyond known maps, where the Greeks once dreamed the world might end. Virgil's invocation of Thulé clings to the edges of history, and yet, in Poe's hands, it finds new life, perhaps spurred by his fascination with the Germanic soul, the echoes of Goethe.\n\nIn this dance of words, Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of old, draws a line between Poe and Goethe, suggesting the former's mimicry of the latter, as if one shadow were cast by another. Goethe, a giant of letters, left the world his Faust, a tale in two acts, the first breathing life in 1808 and the second released as he himself returned to the earth in 1832. Nestled within Faust's verses lies “The King of Thulé,” a mournful tale of a king bereft, his queen gone to dust, her memory etched in a goblet, a testament to loss and the slow poison of remembrance. The king, now adrift, surrenders his worldly goods, save the goblet, which he flings into the abyss of the sea before surrendering to his own fate.\n\nThe air of Thulé, dark and foreboding, mirrors the landscapes of Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" where specters of dead companions haunt the speaker, and the world's colors fade to a shadowed gray. The King of Thulé, in his drink and despair, is perhaps a reflection of Poe's own demons, a dark twin of grief and the solace found in the bottle. It is no wonder that less than a year before Poe penned \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the term Thulé seeped into his consciousness, a thread connecting him to the romantic dramas that swept the stage in the wake of Goethe's shadow.\n\nIn the storied passages of Poe's collected works, Thulé emerges, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" as “ultima Thule,” and then twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem like a silent sentinel. The words draw the pieces together, a dialogue across time with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscapes of both are heavy with solitude and loss, as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has wandered into Goethe's lament, a spectral journey through the ruin of memory.\n\nGoethe, a pillar of the literary world, would have been a presence in Poe's mind, if for no other reason than the respect he bore for Tennyson. In the weave of words, Poe's path crosses with Goethe, through the echoes of their shared respect for the poet laureate, and in the manifold translations and adaptations that Goethe's works inspired. Thus, in the quiet spaces between lines, one finds the soul of Poe, reaching back to touch the hand of Goethe, through the veil of Thulé.",
            "In the land of California, where the sun beats down upon the fields and the law holds sway like an ancient scripture, there arose a question of justice. Could a soul, battered and bruised from a fall upon spilled applesauce in a store, seek the cold comfort of punitive recompense by claiming the keeper of the store harbored malice in his heart? This keeper, twice informed of the slick danger, yet chose his meal over duty's call for a full thirty minutes. \n\nThe judge, he sits there in his black robes, not likely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive measures without due consideration. She must show the court that the storekeeper's deeds were not just negligent, but born of a willful disregard for the harm that might ensue, that his conduct was vile in its indifference. Palmer will lay before them the tale of Martin, who should have known better, for in the months before her own mishap, others had danced unbidden upon similar spills, their cries echoing in the aisles. Yet Martin, with eyes wide open to the chaos, chose inaction. Her claim of his despicable nature might ring weaker, yet it gains strength from the stores of history, six times in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine had bones met the hard floor and Martin remained unmoved.\n\nOn a day in October, the thirteenth of the month at the hour when the sun begins its descent, Rich Wayne, a servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin with news of the applesauce peril. Martin, seated at his table, dismissed the warning, preferring the solace of his meal. Fifteen minutes passed and another, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm anew, only to be met with the same disdain. And so it was at that time, half past the hour, that Palmer found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of Martin's negligence. Five times before had the store seen such calamity that year alone. And now Palmer seeks both compensation for her pain and punishment for the neglect that led her there, while they deliberate on whether to pursue a motion against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the eyes of Californian law, one may grasp at punitive damages not born of contract if the transgressor acted with the shadows of oppression, deceit, or malice. The code speaks of malice as a deed intended to wound or, if not intended, so loathsome in its execution that it was done with a knowing and willful neglect of the safety owed to others. The courts have seen malice in the actions of those who, knowing the peril their deeds might unleash, chose not to avert the storm. Thus, the tale unfolds, and the law and the land await what justice will decree.",
            "She had always been haunted by a sense of wanting, a hollow yearning that refused to be sated, a ghost of desire that whispered in the shadows of her being. It had begun when she was fourteen, a tender age when the world first began to reveal its vastness and its mysteries, and it lingered still three years hence at seventeen. By then, she knew it was someone she sought, not something, yet no boy had caught her eye. Suitors had come and gone, awkward rituals of courtship unfurling like some ancient dance, but her heart remained unmoved. She questioned this peculiar state, pondering what might cause such a deviation from the expected path of a young girl's heart. The years spun out theories in her mind like gossamer threads, none substantial enough to unravel her enigma. So she drifted through life, her desires a riddle murmuring in her soul.\n\nThe days at home were serene, a stillness that wrapped around her like a quilt. Her parents were gentle folk, their voices never raised in anger, and disputes with their daughter were rare as rain in a desert. Their only quarrel lay in her fierce independence, a fire that flared bright against their calm. She was a daughter who danced to her own tune, a burst of color in the quiet tapestry of their lives, her vibrancy a magnet for others drawn to her light.\n\nBut today the peace shattered like glass. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark to ignite her own restless spirit, a scream knifed through the stillness—a sharp note from her mother’s voice. She flew to the kitchen, panic rising like a tide within her. \"Mom?! Mom, what's the matter?!\" Her mother lay prone on the floor, pain etched into every line of her face, breath coming in short, pained gasps. \"Ow,\" she whispered, \"swee... ty, I... need you to take me... to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed from her, each a testament to her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me what to do.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her gently in the back, then drove with a heart pounding with urgency.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of sterility and fear, its air thick with the scent of antiseptic and unspoken dread. But she did not smell it, her mind consumed by the singular task of aiding her mother. She carried her inside, her voice a beacon calling for aid. Faces gathered, concern etched into their features. A rolling bed appeared, and they laid her mother upon it, whisking her away into the labyrinth of care. The daughter was left behind, a solitary sentinel in a waiting room of worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase perched high upon a cabinet, a simple act that had spiraled into calamity.",
            "In the vast annals of human inquiry, this study was wrought from the necessity to discern the bond between adherence to what the ancients called the Mediterranean Diet and the specter of chronic heart disease and the grim reaper known as stroke. The diet, in its alternate form, the aMed diet, stands as a testament to simplicity and the earth’s bounty. It whispers of fruits and nuts, whole grains, legumes, and the oils of olives, favoring the unsaturated over the bloated excesses of animal fats, allowing for the gentle indulgence of the vine's nectar.\n\nIn the chronicles of science past, there have been whispers, threads of evidence woven into tales of this diet’s power over the heart's maladies and the relentless march of mortality. Its superiority over the austere confines of a low-fat regimen was noted, a harbinger of weight shed and the blood’s chemistry altered. Yet, in these tales, the dire strokes of fate were oft left in shadow.\n\nThe saga unfolds with seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, nurses by trade, from the tender age of thirty-eight to the cusp of sixty-three. They, unmarked by the histories of cardiovascular affliction or diabetes, stood as sentinels in this study, woven into the fabric of the Nurses' Health Study that spanned eleven states. From the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four to two thousand and four, their dietary tales were recorded sixfold through the self-reported food frequency questionnaires. The steadfastness of these women was near absolute, with over ninety-five percent holding true to the course across two decades. Their reports of heart and stroke were etched in the stone of medical records and autopsies, or when absent, deemed probable, casting a shadow on a small fraction of strokes and heart events.\n\nTo grasp the truth of their diet, the scores were culled from years past, smoothing the randomness of a single year’s consumption. Age and smoke, the weight of their bodies, the state of their hormones, all were accounted for, lest they cloud the findings. The hand of Cox modeling was employed, sifting through the sands of data to reveal the link between diet and the fates of heart and stroke, each in their fatal and nonfatal guises.\n\nThe reckoning was clear. Those women who embraced the diet of the Mediterranean, who stood atop the quintile, found themselves less likely to fall to the ravages of heart and stroke than those who lingered at the base, their risk reduced by a measure of 0.71. Such was the tale told by the study over the long years, a testament to the diet’s power against the silent killers of the heart and brain.",
            "The sign says Hitler lives in Burma.  \nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner. Her arm raised high, clutching a piece of cardboard with those words scrawled in dark Sharpie, a message bleak and unsettling. Burma, or Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, ruled by a harsh military junta whose grip tightened in 1962 when power was seized in a coup d'état. In 2007, the streets bore witness to protests not seen in a decade, led by the holy men clad in saffron robes, the monks. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, named for the hue of the robes that draped the monks, those bearers of peace in a land shrouded in tyranny. At first the junta watched with reluctance as the monks assembled peacefully, but soon the tide turned. Violence surged and the streets became a battleground, monasteries desecrated by the hands of soldiers. Foreign eyes that dared to capture truth were snatched, imprisoned. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27, 2007—his only crime, witnessing the streets' unrest. The official count said thirteen lost souls, but Colonel Hla Win, a man who fled the army's ranks, spoke of more, a multitude silenced, bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nYet this is no new tale. History is a scroll of blood and power, of rulers who stifle the breath of dissent to clutch their dominion. The emperors of Rome, claiming divine favor, wielded absolute power over their domains. In Japan, emperors walked as gods among men, leading their people into modernity and death alike. Our own president, George W. Bush, converses weekly with Ted Haggard, a shepherd of the unenlightened flock, under the aegis of the Republic Party.\n\nThe pages of history are marked by such tyranny. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars and laborers and youth stood against the iron rule of governance, tell of a massacre veiled by numbers that shift like sand, from the government's two or three hundred to the thousands whispered by the Chinese Red Cross. Rwanda in the nineties, its soil soaked with the blood of Tutsis and moderates alike, slaughtered by Hutu militias with the government's nod. And then there was the Third Reich, Hitler's reign, a dark age when Jewish lives were extinguished across nations.",
            "In the long shadows cast by the night, a man sits at a piano, fingers tracing the keys as if they were the lines of a well-worn map. His name is Duke Ellington, a name that carries with it the weight of years and the echoes of a hundred thousand notes. His legacy in the world of jazz is woven not merely from time but from the threads of creation, an orchestra shaped by his hand and mind. The piano, his silent companion, whispers its presence in the compositions that dance like phantoms across the worn paper, each one a testament to Ellington’s genius. As a composer, he built worlds within worlds, crafting pieces of such intricate beauty that the band members found their true voices within his frames.\n\nEllington’s genius lay in the way he understood the soul of his orchestra, each player a solitary note in a grand symphony. He forged spaces where the soloist could soar, untethered, while simultaneously crafting phrases that bound the ensemble in a tapestry of sound, each thread a reflection of his vision. In this alchemy, he found the soul of his music, a coherent sound that was uniquely his own. His mastery was not just of the notes but of the men who played them, and in that mastery, he wrote his name across the annals of jazz history.\n\nAmong the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, there are whisperings of Ellington’s sound, a sound that found voice in the piece known as Creole Love Call. Here, the voice becomes not a vessel of words, but an instrument, pure and unadorned. This was Ellington’s way, weaving texture and color into the silence, a testament to his skill in complementing the voices of his soloists. The slow cadence of a twelve-bar blues unfolds, each chorus a chapter in a story without words:\n\nThe first chorus, a conversation between voice and reeds, begins softly, a gentle melody that grows rougher, more insistent. The muted trumpet follows, exploring the melody’s shadows, bending notes to its will. A clarinet rises, sweeping high above the earth, underpinned by the subtle syncopation of the piano. The full band swells, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a call and response. As the fifth chorus builds, the reeds take the lead, their voices high and clear, the rhythm section marking time in syncopated stops. And the final chorus returns to the beginning, the voice growling as an instrument, echoing the dialogue with the reeds. A brief tag closes the piece, a vocal run ending in the dissonant sigh of a trombone.\n\nEllington’s voice, his true instrument, lies in the way he colors a piece, each note a brushstroke in a masterwork. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his skill at orchestration melds with his ear for tone. ‘Bubber’ Miley’s muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox’s scat singing, each voice a reflection of the other, creating a sound both rich and strange. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas further, Ellington’s hand guiding Joe ‘Tricky Sam’ Nanton’s muted trombone to introduce the melody, a touchstone in the vast landscape of Ellington’s creation.",
            "In the quiet calculus of life, why do creatures change their form as they do? What hidden hands bid them to evolve along certain paths and not others? It's a question pondered by men given to deeper thoughts than most, like D'Arcy Thompson, who mused upon the mathematical nature of life’s simplest forms, way back in the year 1917. And even now, the riddle remains unsolved. Yet, with the passage of years, minds like Raup and Stanley turned their gaze to the humble mollusk, seeking patterns in the spiral dance of shells across the ages.\n\nOur inquiry ventures into the realm of hard numbers and soft forms, where we study the genus Prunum through the twin lenses of mathematics and experiment. We harness the power of X-rays to capture the ghostly outlines of shells, parsing them into figures and formulas that might unlock the secrets of evolutionary change. Into the computer’s maw we feed these numbers, using a tool born of the modern age, CerioShell, to conjure forth visions of shells that might have been. These visions help us chart the borders of possibility, the land where change is born.\n\nConsider a shell, not merely as nature’s ornament, but as a tale writ in stone, a tube spun slowly through the vastness of time. Each revolution, each whirl around its hidden axis—the columella—is a chapter in its story. The pace of its growth, the lines of its past, these sutures, they whisper of its journey. At its heart is the body whorl, last and largest, while the spire rises, apex to base, as if reaching for the heavens. Life within reaches out through the aperture, the portal to its world.\n\nIn contemplation, these shells reveal themselves from every angle—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural—as if inviting understanding from every perspective. The common view, aperture forward, apex skyward, speaks most clearly to us.\n\nTo count the whorls is to trace the labyrinthine path of life itself. Begin at the shell’s peak, mark the start of its first suture, and divide its form with an unseen line. From here, the whorls count themselves, each a testament to a quarter turn more of life’s relentless march.\n\nView the shell as a procession of apertures, a dance through space and time, as the creature within builds its spiraled home. By plotting the center of each whorl’s aperture, by charting the radius both wide and high, we map this journey.\n\nAnd in this mapping, in these symbols and signs, lies the power to alter the course of skeletogenesis, to walk the path of gods and change the fate of mollusks. We turn the unknown into known, the unseen into seen, through the lens of mathematics that seeks to comprehend the very essence of life’s unfolding.",
            "In the quiet lands of Indonesia, where the sun casts long shadows upon the earth, the toll of newborns and infants taken too soon has held its ground against the passage of a decade. Though the nation strides with purpose toward the Millennium Development Goals, like a traveler on a well-trodden path to fresh waters and purified air, the hopes for the health of mothers and their children remain distant, like a mirage in the desert sands. These aspirations, unmet, speak of a need not for mere remedies but for the fortification of the very foundations of their healing ways.\n\nIn the villages and towns, they have seen the hands of skilled healers at the birthside grow more frequent, now at seventy-two in every hundred, yet among these are those whose craft is of the old ways, the midwives, whose gentle guidance cannot stave off the crimson tide should it rise. Thus, the numbers, though they tell a tale of progress, do whisper deceitfully of a journey far from its end. The children who suffer the scourge of diarrhea find fewer hands of trained healers to comfort them, and in the days after birth, the care that should cradle mother and child falters, a flickering candle in the wind.\n\nIn the realm of childbirth, the knife that might save a life is seldom wielded, with cuts made in only four of every hundred. In the bustling heart of the cities, these cuts are sevenfold, yet in the quiet stretches of the countryside, they dwindle to two. It is a stark telling of a land divided by access, where the healing touch gathers in cities and leaves the rural folk to fend with less. Among the rich and the poor, a chasm of twenty-seven in a hundred stands, a testament to the hardships faced by those with less, their way barred by the weight of coin.\n\nAnd so, the road ahead lies obscured by questions. How shall they breathe life into the care for mother and child? Should they seek the allure of singular paths, or should they bind their strength to the shaping of a robust system, one that does not forsake those at the start and end of life’s journey? The call of focused endeavors, like the siren’s song, is tempting, promising swift victories with clear goals. Yet, heed must be given to the shadows they cast, for a heavy hand upon one part may drain the lifeblood from another, drawing away the healers to where the riches flow. Parallel tracks in the sand, uncoordinated and redundant, lead only to a tangle of forms, a labyrinth of papers and pleas.\n\nThus, the story unfolds, and the choices lie before them like roads diverging in a quiet wood, each with its promise and peril. The way must be chosen with care, for upon it rests the hope of many, the silent prayer for a brighter dawn.",
            "In the slow turning of a century past, the landscape of what folks call Popular Music has grown wild and tangled, a bramble of genres blooming in every direction, so that to name them all is a task near impossible. Each genre, be it rap or rock or country, jazz or folk, has given birth to myriad offspring, sub-genres breeding sub-sub-genres like rivers splitting into streams. Among these, there stands Heavy Metal, a colossus that has, over the span of four decades, become a thing both diverse and expressive, a shadowed mirror to the human heart. It speaks in tones of darkness, a symphony of the night, yet it is an art form of many voices, each taking the bones of the old and crafting anew, creating sub-strains and further branches that stretch toward the horizon without end.\n\nAnd now, in this present time, the heavy metal kingdom is a labyrinth of niches and factions, each claiming its own piece of the sky, so that one might ponder what heavy metal truly is. It is a mosaic, a tapestry woven with threads borrowed from other realms, yet its roots are deep, and to grasp the essence of today's metal, one must turn back to understand the movement itself, the force that drives it beyond mere classification as a genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement sculpted in shadow. It is the music of excess, a cacophony of more—more depth, more sound, more fury, more spectacle. Gone is the simplicity, for those who play do so with a mastery that speaks through the strings and skins. It is a movement, too, that bears the mark of illusion, the haze of substances that fueled the mid-seventies, leading artists to the edge of madness and beyond, crafting records that seemed to belong to other worlds, the drugs a veil through which creation was glimpsed. It holds within it a rawness, a ferocity that was unfamiliar in the realm of popular song, which so often shied away from the shadows. The generations that followed drew from this well of darkness, finding kinship with the tumultuous emotions of the Romantic Era, a lineage of passion and despair. \n\nConsider the words of Helter Skelter, a tune that laid bare the shadowed side of the Beatles, a descent and ascent that mirrored the wild dance of the mind under the spell of substances. This song, some say, stands as one of the forebears of Heavy Metal itself, an answer to the Stones' own dark offering, a declaration that the Beatles too could summon the weight of thunder, and so it found its place upon The White Album.",
            "In a time before the Surrealists laid their brushstrokes upon the canvas of dreams, Henri Rousseau stood alone, a solitary figure crafting visions from the depths of his own soul. The year was 1910, and in his painting The Dream, Rousseau conjured not just the image of a woman transfixed by the marvels of an ethereal land but wove into its fabric the essence of his own aspirations and desires. For within that lush jungle, Rousseau's yearning for recognition and acclaim by his peers and the art world at large lay entwined with the foliage. His journey was fraught with the quiet turmoil of choosing between the mimicry of established forms for acceptance and the uncharted path of creative independence.\n\nTo peer into the heart of The Dream, one must first wander through the shadowed corridors of Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quiet town of Laval, France, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man who enjoyed the modest comforts of bourgeois life (Shattuck 47). Rousseau was untouched by the formal teachings of artistry, laboring instead under the yoke of the gabelou, the municipal toll service, until he found himself at forty, wrongly dubbed a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). Tragedy cast a long shadow over his days, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children leaving him with but one daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief (Shattuck 49). It was to the canvas he turned, seeking solace and rebirth amidst the pigments.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau painted with the simplicity and sincerity of the folk, driven by the dreams common to his kind. His quest for acceptance was a natural desire, one amplified by his lack of formal education and the lateness of his start in a world brimming with younger, celebrated talents. It was not until the likes of Matisse began to rise that Rousseau's art found its way into the light. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, draws a line between the two: Matisse, who feared the mundane, and Rousseau, who longed for his art to be conventional enough to secure a place in the Artiste Français (92). And so, Rousseau's brush moved, caught between worlds, painting his dreams with the hope of finding his place among them.",
            "The old thinkers, long given to pondering, have often drawn a line twixt the realms of ethics and aesthetics, a bridge between truth and beauty. There’s a deep-seated reason for this, like the poet Keats murmured in his ode upon that ancient urn, where he spoke of beauty and truth as if they were one and the same. In the world, much is learned through books and the hard hand of experience, yet there lies a knowledge of ethics and aesthetics that seems to spring forth unbidden, needing no teacher's voice. These aren't mere prescriptions, but rather descriptions of the world’s order. Our musings on what is moral or what is beautiful oft become pursuits to understand why a painting captivates or why a deed rings true, rather than setting down laws for art or conduct.\n\nCritiques of art or ethics falter, never grasping the whole of what makes something good or beautiful. Take, for instance, that enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa; one might speak of its lines, its shadows, its place in the heart of culture, but these alone cannot capture why it grips the soul. When asked of a beloved piece of art or tale, folks often say there’s just something about it, hinting at a truth that eludes the grasp of words. Art and morals resist reduction, as Flannery O'Connor once said, for a story speaks truths that plain statements cannot. Even when we lay bare every facet of a tale, something ineffable remains. Ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein once whispered of ethics as a thing that cannot be spoken, a transcendental force. It’s this elusive something, this je ne sais quoi, that grants both art and morality their power, binding them in their shared transcendence.\n\nMorality and art walk hand in hand, for they touch us at a level beyond mere explanation, like the noumenon Kant spoke of. They move us where words stumble and fail. This bond is even more pronounced in literature, where, as McKean observed, its moral heart sets it apart from other arts. While moral standards might seem unfitting for music, they are woven into literature as they are into life itself. Living demands values, and literature holds our interest precisely because of the values it unveils.",
            "In the present age, Germany stands as a formidable entity, a nation forged in unity with a culture as diverse as the landscapes it spans, from the shadowy folds of the Bavarian Alps in München to the northern reaches by the Baltic in Kiel. This cultural tapestry weaves itself through Köln on the banks of the Rhine, stretching across the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden upon the Elbe. Such a singular culture springs from myriad origins, a confluence of tribes and histories that bore the Germany we now behold.\n\nThe land of Germania, ancient and storied, is the cradle from which the Germans arise. The very name stirs dispute among the learned, tangled in the annals of history. Tacitus once wrote of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name German before ever they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. So claimed the historian in a distant age. And before him, Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, uttered the word \"Germanus\" to mark the tribes who dwelt beyond his reach, ever skirmishing across the river's breadth. He borrowed this name from the Gauls to delineate those he had conquered from those yet unconquered. The true origin remains shrouded, some say a neighborly term in the Gaulish tongue, while others muse on the spear, the ger, or the Old Irish cry, garim, that spoke of a people boisterous in battle.\n\nTacitus, in his account from AD 98, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" mused upon the Germans' beginnings, suggesting they were untouched by foreign mingling. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" Who, he pondered, would forsake the temperate climes of Asia or Africa for the wilds of Germania, with its harsh skies and dour visage, unless it were indeed his home?\n\nAnd what Roman, in possession of the world's bounty, would trade the grandeur of Rome for the untamed expanse of Germania? None but the legions, driven by conquest, seeking goods to haul back to their empire's heart. From time to time, they ventured forth, their campaigns in those lands brief and often returning them to Rome's embrace. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes, emerging in the first century's midst, lingered at the empire's edge. They bartered their harvests and lent their strength to Rome's legions, straddling the line between alliance and independence. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the theater of Twelfth Night, the masks we wear might shelter us for a spell, but they demand a reckoning. A man or woman might craft a new face to wear, but the danger lies in the wearing of it too long. For should one cling too dearly to such deception, they might find themselves estranged from their own soul. The shedding of a false skin comes with its own perils, and in the casting off, one might stand alone, alienated from kin and friend alike. The choice then falls upon the deceiver, to hold fast to the truth of themselves or to preserve the fragile bonds with those around them. For the revelation of deceit is a coin with two faces, some might shrug and carry on, while others would storm and rail against the perceived betrayal.\n\nThe play casts a particular light on the tangle of deception in matters of gender, raising the question that gnaws at the heart: why does one abandon their own visage for another? In Viola’s plight, the reason is plain as day. She dons her disguise not for trickery’s sake but as a shield against the unknown dangers of a foreign shore. Her words speak of necessity, a captain and a cloak to veil her maidenhood and safeguard her path: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…”\n\nYet, this guise, while a bulwark, serves also as a wall, cutting her off from her sisters, leaving her adrift without the solace of shared womanhood. Worse still, her mask is so complete that Olivia, mistaking the semblance for truth, entwines her heart with Viola’s. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” And further, there lies the unspoken bond with Orsino, a thread stretched taut by hidden desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nA modern eye might see in this a tale of how deception unravels the knots of hidden emotions, forcing the likes of Olivia and Orsino to face shadows they never knew. Does Olivia love a man because she sees a man, or is there a deeper truth she dares not name? Yet, the ease with which she turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a simpler parody, a reflection of those who place trust in appearances alone. Her words to Viola, “A sister, you are she,” reveal a heart that shifts with the tides, from lover to kin, as if the mask itself had drawn a line between them. \n\nAnd so, the play dances on, a mirror held up to the fractures of identity and desire, a world where the truth is both a burden and a blessing.",
            "The annals of German dominion over foreign lands bear witness to a severity that has not gone unnoticed, especially in the dark recesses of history where the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples lies, buried but not forgotten, amidst the arid expanses of German South West Africa. Yet to cast one's net so wide as to catch the entirety of an empire within a single narrative is folly. The German colonial empire sprawled across diverse lands, each holding its own tale of governance and policy, its own way of educating those under its shadow. It was a patchwork of intentions and executions.\n\nWhen the British unfurled their flag over German East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they discovered a populace not unfamiliar with letters and learning, a testament to the German efforts in education. Kamerun and other colonies too bore the marks of an educational legacy that garnered praise from the chroniclers of the time. But South West Africa, present-day Namibia, stood apart, a land where the sun baked the earth and the minds of its native people were left largely untouched by the hands of formal education. The government there had turned its gaze away, leaving missionary societies to the task with scant support, while it poured resources into the schooling of its own kind, building state schools for Europeans and tightening its grip on the missionary endeavors.\n\nThis divergence bore its fruit in the years that followed the German retreat. Where other colonies could count among their numbers a host of literate and learned Africans, South West Africa remained a land of silence and illiteracy for the native majority. The reasons for this schism are tangled in the roots of social, political, and economic factors, a web this paper seeks to unravel, drawing upon fresh insights into the mindset of settlers and the colonial governors who ruled them.\n\nThe corpus of writings on German colonial education is vast, yet primarily penned in the tongue of its origin and from a time not long after the empire's fall. These early accounts sought to capture the essence of the educational systems, while later works in English brought forth a comparative gaze, revealing the disparities between colonies and delving deeper into the particulars of their educational frameworks. Cohen's treatise stands as a pillar among these, examining the schooling of South West and East Africa, juxtaposing their systems and probing the roots of their differences. He points to the substantial settler populace in South West Africa as a key to understanding its peculiarities.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climes and sweeping deserts, offered a refuge of sorts for European settlers. By the year 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly fifteen thousand, a stark contrast to the mere five thousand three hundred thirty-six who made their homes in East Africa, the next bastion of settler presence. These figures, like the land itself, tell a story of harsher divides and unyielding landscapes.",
            "The lands of the United States and Mexico once lay locked in a dance of discord, a rivalry that stretched itself thin over fifty-seven years, from the year of our Lord eighteen thirty-six till eighteen ninety-three. The Mexican-American War of eighteen forty-six to forty-eight marked the pinnacle of this tumult, where the United States, with the vigor of its manifest destiny, surged forth and wrested from Mexico the lands of Texas and the great American Southwest. These nations found themselves caught in a litany of skirmishes and quarrels, the echoes of their enmity lingering on the winds till the eve of the Great War. The seed of their discord was sown deep in the soil of their disparate beliefs, a chasm of religion and culture dividing them, and a clash of material desires stoking the fires of their discontent.\n\nThis tale is not a solitary one, for many a nation has found in its neighbor a rival, the shared border a line drawn in sand and blood. The United States and Mexico stand as testament to such enduring rivalries, their histories intertwined like the gnarled roots of an ancient tree. David M. Pletcher wrote of these long-standing American quandaries, noting that Mexico and Cuba, like old wounds, troubled the United States more than any other nations of the southern continent. In contrast, other lands of Latin America basked in the warmth of amicable relations with the North.\n\nIn the shadows of this struggle lay the specter of religion, a divide as ancient as any other. The clash of faiths, a battle fought not with swords but with the convictions of souls. As Sally Frahm observed, the Americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries bore an aversion to Catholicism much as their descendants would to the ideologies of fascism and communism. The distrust between these two peoples was an inheritance from their colonial progenitors, the English and the Spanish, and it stood as a monolith barring the path to peace.\n\nSeventeen disputes mark the annals of this rivalry, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts, most of them squabbles over the rugged frontier where bandits roamed and border towns lay vulnerable to the lawless throng. Only the might of military force from both sides would quell the chaos that lingered at the edges of civilization.\n\nAs the years drew on, the rivalry began to fade, not with a final clash but with a shift in the balance. Mexico found itself reliant on the United States, the former's ambitions turning from territorial conquest to the subtler arts of economic influence. And thus, the chapter closed on a rivalry that had marked the landscape of two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an illness unknown to me claimed my body and left it undone, a sudden and unforeseen affliction that turned my world to shadow. I was a nurse then, a calling I had chosen from a need so deep it seemed carved into my very bones—a craving for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"You'll always have work; sickness will never cease,\" the voices of my upbringing echoed as I grew. And so it was that my dreams of science and the written word, dreams of becoming both a seeker and a scribe, faded like the twilight, and I embraced the path of healing.\n\nYet there I stood at forty-six, solitary and without a fortune to call my own, rendered incapable of toil. Disabled still, I have endured fifteen years upon the meager rations of Social Security, and now all that remains is the stark truth of having nothing that bears the mark of mine. I endure, but each day is a trial, a relentless assault upon my soul. Certainty is a stranger to me now, but one truth remains steadfast—I could not have traversed these years without the steadfast aid of kin and comrades. For when disaster strikes, the strength you thought you possessed vanishes like mist on the wind.\n\nEmergencies, both grand and trivial, are life's constant companions, and no amount of preparation can shield you from every storm. It is folly to place our trust in the bloated belly of bureaucracy, as it crumbles and decays before our eyes. Instead, I yearn for a nation where trust is sown among us, where we once more turn to our neighbors for aid and offer our own hands in return, rather than retreating into solitude behind the barricades of our own making.\n\nThe rugged individualism that is oft heralded as the foundation of this land is but a myth. It was compassion, shared burdens, and the pooling of resources that sustained our forebears through their trials. The pioneers who braved the vastness of the Rockies did not find the coast by the strength of their own arms alone.\n\nSo yes, be prepared. As am I. A kit for disaster sits ready, stocked with the necessities: first aid, tablets to cleanse water, plastic sheathing and tape to seal against the unseen. Flashlights and their batteries, candles and matches that defy the rain, canned sustenance, all await the hour of need. If you possess the means for a plot of earth and the skill to preserve its bounty, seize it. A wood stove is a boon, provided you do not dwell too high above the ground.\n\nBut in your preparations, do not forget this: the knowing of your neighbors is a gift beyond measure.",
            "In the dim corridors of time, somewhere in the shadowed centuries before the Christ, a prince was born unto the world. He would come to be known as the Buddha, a name that would echo through the ages. Through his life, he turned his back on the opulence of princely realms and sought enlightenment, his teachings giving rise to a path known as Buddhism. Among its branches, the Theravada sect stands as the oldest, like a tree whose roots run deep into ancient soil. Two and a half millennia have passed since then, and time has molded the religion, casting it into forms unimagined in the Buddha’s days. In lands such as Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, the ritual of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds each year, a dance of monks and laymen alike. This ritual, absent from the original teachings, speaks to the inexorable change that has touched even the core of Buddhist belief. The essence of Theravada, from the rituals to the very heart of its doctrine, has felt the tremors of transformation, driven by forces both within and beyond, some adversarial, others indifferent.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, we must lay out certain terms. Internal forces arise from the heart of the Buddhasasana, from those who walk the path of the monk and the layman. External forces are those that press upon the community from the outside, from those untouched by Buddhist doctrine. Hostile forces bear the weight of malice, seeking to rend the fabric of the faith, while benign forces drift without purpose, indifferent yet capable of leaving their mark. These terms will be the compass for our exploration.\n\nLet us first peer into the core of Theravada Buddhism, into the doctrines that form its bedrock. The Buddhist seeks refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, vast and profound, is encompassed within the Tripitaka, the triune scripture. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical. Therein lie the truths of Anatta, the soul’s absence; Dukkha, life’s suffering; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Only by embracing these can one sever the cycle of Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to the chains of desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka dictates the path, with five precepts to guide the layman—do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not stray in lust, do not cloud the mind with intoxicants. The monk’s path is one of greater discipline. At the heart of it all lie the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering; second, that suffering’s root is attachment; third, that liberation is within reach."
