            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men speak of agreements and the nature of things unseen, culture casts its long shadow. It is a specter defined as much by its absence as by its presence, by the echoes it leaves in the soul and the weight it bears on the tongue. Culture is no monolith, no singular entity, but a multitudinous sea. To say that all Russians are steadfast as the northern winds or that all Japanese move with the yielding grace of willow branches is to paint the world in the colors of folly. These broad strokes miss the contours that matter, the subtle plays of light and dark that shape the terrain of negotiation. To step into the world of another is to see through the veil of one's own making, where the familiar dances with the foreign, and understanding is a bridge built from the stones of comparison.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another's culture is a journey through time and trial, a path that winds through the pages of history and the shadows of prejudice. It is not for the judge to pass sentence nor the reformer to remake, but for the traveler to accept the world as it is, to navigate its currents with care. Especially when the winds are against you, when the ground beneath your feet is strange, respect is the compass that will lead you past the reefs of misunderstanding and toward the open sea of accord.\n\nYet let it be known that culture knows no bounds of nation alone. Within the walls of commerce, cultures rise and fall like the tides. A company may build its house on the sands of long hours or the shores of leisure. It is in the cut of a suit, the cadence of a voice, the delegation of power, that one sees the hand of culture at work. Philanthropy may be a river flowing freely or a spring tapped by command. Look closely at the fabric of American enterprise, stitched with threads of diversity and variance, and see the quilt of thought that lies beneath. Even where the surface seems smooth, the depths promise complexity.\n\nValues are the compass rose by which the currents of culture are charted. They tell the why of a thing. Should a culture hold dear the sanctity of face or the balm of harmony, know that no man will disgrace his kin or master for the sake of gain. Where the bargain is king, the game is played to the last breath. These truths must be known before words are spoken, before hands are clasped across the table. Yet the wise negotiator sees beyond the mask of culture, seeks the man behind the role, for it is there that the true language of negotiation is learned.",
            "In the silence of the ancient text, the fool whispers to himself a denial of the divine. Such is the lamentation of Psalm 14, a refrain echoed in the musings of St. Anselm as he ponders the ethereal nature of a God unseen yet ever-present. Here too stands Thomas Aquinas, shadowed by the same inquiry, and thus we are cast into the task of discerning the superior testament to the divine. Yet for brevity's sake, we must assume a common ground in their belief—a God shaped by the scriptures of old, the God of the Bible. To entertain an abstraction beyond their shared vision would undermine the very essence of their defense, for they argue not for gods many but for one.\n\nAnd so we delve into Anselm's meditation, a journey inward, faith as the lantern by which he navigates the dark corridors of the soul. It is within this inner sanctum that he claims the presence of God is known, a truth not external but intrinsic, woven into the fabric of our understanding. His words twist and turn, a labyrinth of thought, yet the heart of it is this: God's existence anchored in the mind’s eye, self-evident and unassailable.\n\nContrast this with Aquinas, who stands upon the firm ground of reason, eschewing the ethereal for the tangible. His is a God proven by the world’s own mechanics, a deity revealed through the lens of empirical scrutiny. To him, faith is but a crutch unnecessary, for his God is found in the logic of motion and cause, in the necessity of existence and order. Five paths he lays before us, each a testament to the rational soul, each a puzzle piece fitting in the grand design that speaks to the divine presence.\n\nIn the end, neither argument holds the whole truth, for each is but a facet of the same jewel, reflecting the light of understanding in different hues. Yet through their words, we glimpse the eternal, a whisper of the divine that stirs the heart and challenges the mind.",
            "In the craft of writing, authors wield various tools to evoke a certain sentiment or posture toward matters of consequence. Among these tools, some prove more potent than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, such techniques abound, woven into the very fabric of the narrative. Fitzgerald, with a meticulous hand, pairs adjectives and nouns in uncommon unions, casting a particular aura upon his subjects. At times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, employing it with deliberate intent. Within the pages of his novel, Fitzgerald imbues colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink with profound significance. Through The Great Gatsby, he constructs a language of colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, to evoke a memory of a feeling tied to something of import.\n\nWhite and gray, in Fitzgerald's palette, speak of sameness, with white bearing the sheen of elegance and gray the weight of age and wear. He lays the groundwork for this meaning early on, with persistent refrains of both. Daisy and Jordan are portrayed perpetually \"in white\"—a recurring motif. Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" in Myrtle's presence, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" It is only when Nick perceives the spectacle of Gatsby's festivity that the hues shift to \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald delineates these shades further, painting mundanity in their tones: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the attendees of Gatsby's soirées become \"gray names\" in Nick's ledger, and Catherine’s abode is but \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—the embodiment of uniformity. Common folk and places are cast in white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is strewn with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" a child at the railway is \"gray,\" as is the dog-seller, \"a gray old man.\"\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has suffused white/gray with enough meaning, he wields them to signify insignificance or conformity. This symbology first takes root with Daisy. After an extended absence of these tones, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" transforming her into less a person and more a piece of the uniform landscape, an object of Gatsby's yearning. This technique envelops Daisy, underscoring her role as a mere part of the tapestry: a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,\" and once more, she is clad in \"white\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the land rolls gentle and the air is warm, the earth yields its bounty with a quiet abundance. The fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens that sway in the soft breeze, the squat forms of squash and broccoli, herbs and the hanging fruits of trees—peaches, lemons—that glimmer like small suns. In that place, the berries grow sweet and honey is gathered, peppers burn their red and green into the soil, and the people there have a hunger for the organic, for the earth's pure gift untarnished by man's hand. Long waiting lists stretch out for the promise of such bounty, and eggs and milk untouched by the ordinary means of production find their way to eager mouths. The land itself opens its arms to those who seek more than sustenance, offering paths for the wandering foot, the watching of birds, the simple pleasure of being amid the living world.\n\nThis is the way of things, a land where the owner might find themselves with the benefits accorded by the government for tending their earth with care, improving the wild spaces, offering the curious a glimpse into the workings of their farm, and perhaps in doing so, finding a way to sustain both themselves and the land they hold dear. The organic way is not without its burdens. It demands the sweat of labor, the vigilance against pest and weed, the nurturing of the soil without the crutch of chemical aid. The losses are keenly felt, for the scale of such endeavor is small, the hands few. Yet in this, there is the promise of life more diverse, the land teeming with what might otherwise be lost to the sterility of the conventional.\n\nThere is a place in this tale, a parcel set against the town of Potrero, lying in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. A span of 160 acres where chaparral and the nonnative grasses of the Mediterranean meet the oak woodland that stands sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. It is a realm within the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its net over many a creature and plant. Over a hundred of them, some teetering on the brink of oblivion—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, those fragile wings of certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher among them. Others are slipping from us, like the burrowing owls whose homes are threatened.\n\nThe land bears the marks of those who came before, the Native Americans who walked its soil for untold ages, and later the ranchers and sellers of cordwood who laid their claim in the 1800s. This land was once a homestead, a place for grazing and the harvesting of wood through the passage of years. Here I chose to lay my gaze upon a property, drawn from the pages of real estate, to seek out the paths a small farmer might tread, searching for the aid that government might offer to ease their burden and preserve the wild that their toil tends to. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model for what might be wrought from this land by hands willing to dream and to labor.",
            "In the dusky quiet of the world, there exists a bond between brothers that time nor tempest can sunder. It's a tether woven with threads of love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, each strand a testament to their shared blood and shared fate. Brothers know each other in ways that no one else can fathom, for in the eyes of one lies the reflection of the other, a strange mirror of the soul. And it is in the darkest hours, when the world seems to tilt towards oblivion, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be stained with virtue or vice. These emotions, when unfurled, demand their due, and the understanding of such demands is to reckon with their price. For when a man looks into the eyes of his brother and sees there his own visage, he sees not the mask the world perceives but the essence of his being. In the deeds he commits, and the shadows those deeds cast, his true nature is revealed. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this perilous path, their hearts a battleground of emotions fierce and wild. Through a land resplendent in its verdancy, they embark upon a journey doomed from the start. Disappointment, bitter as gall, meets pride, fierce as flame, in the story's dreadful climax, and only one brother emerges from the darkness. The theme winds its way through the characters of the brothers, through the eyes of Doodle and the narrator, who bears witness to the storm within his heart and the world outside, each shaping his steps and the path he treads.\n\nThe heart of the protagonist, it beats with pride—a pride that spurs him from the first steps he takes beside his fragile brother, Doodle, to the last fateful venture they share. Resentment shadows his love, for he yearned for a brother who could match his stride, who could learn the secrets of breath held, of feet flying over earth, of limbs reaching for the sky among the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to rest in the arms of the ancient pine by the barn. But Doodle, frail Doodle, was a child marked by fate, his heart a delicate thing, surviving against all odds. The dreams of the young protagonist shattered like glass, his fantasies dashed upon the rocks of reality. Anger crept in, dark and insidious, leading him to thoughts of ending the tiny life that had so betrayed his hopes. What boy contemplates such darkness? Yet the shadow lifts when the child smiles, a simple gesture that speaks of light and possibility. In that smile, the protagonist finds a flicker of hope, an awakening of the love that lay dormant beneath his pride. His resolve, it seems, was but a shadow in the presence of his brother's light.",
            "In the vast and shadowed labyrinth that is the human mind, one finds a tangle of complexities and creations, an engine of thought and wonder. As the world spun forward from the firelit caves to the towers of glass, the image of the mind shifted with it. Once likened to a tablet of wax, then a parchment, then a tome, and now a machine of wires and circuits. Yet in all these likenesses lies a folly, for in their simplicity they veil the truth of the mind's mystery.\n\nThe senses are the gates through which the world enters, each a whisper of the earth turned into signals of light and sound and touch, electric and chemical. The mind, in its silent depths, takes these murmurs, weaving them into shapes and meanings, a dance of bottom and top, rising and falling like the tides. Consider the sight of a dark box upon a pale expanse, the eye gathering the hues and lines, the brain discerning the box from the nothingness, a dark shape against the light. Yet the mind, knowing more than it sees, tells you this is no mere void but a thing of substance, a box and not a hole.\n\nAnd as the world floods in, there stands a sentinel of attention, choosing which echoes to heed, which to let pass into the depths. It spares you the blades of grass beneath your feet, yet in the clamor of voices, it plucks your name from the air. In this filtering, the mind’s work is never done, ever sifting, ever weaving.\n\nTo hold what is known, the mind must bind it in memory, each a thread in the tapestry of thought. There are memories that flicker and fade, others that linger long. They are encoded, each sense its own tongue, be it the shape of a word upon the page, the sound it echoes, or the meaning it holds. Once bound, they must endure. In fleeting memory, perhaps it is a spark that leaps the gap between cells. In the deeper wells of memory, it may be the very frame of life itself, a structure of proteins holding fast.\n\nThe knowing of things, how they sit within the mind, has been drawn in many maps. Some speak of webs of meaning, nodes of thought connected by threads unseen, like stars in a constellation. Thus a chair might find itself beside a table, and both might touch upon the notion of wood, each a stepping stone upon the river of thought. \n\nIn all this, the mind stands a testament to the unfathomable, a testament to what it means to see and to know.",
            "In the year 2007, the land of America found itself ensnared in a relentless financial maelstrom. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the once steadfast bastions of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations of the nation lay broken and desolate. This recession lingers still, and so we are compelled to ponder the origins of this calamity and seek a path to forestall its recurrence. The crisis, born of avarice and naïveté in the halls of power, saw banks and firms driven to dispense sub-prime loans upon a financial edifice ill-equipped to bear such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the yoke of pressure, took to underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When the weight of default bore down upon the borrowers, the banks, bereft of capital reserve, unleashed chaos upon the repackaged mortgages they had sown, casting the economy into turmoil.\n\nThe seeds of this financial debacle were sown in the soil of 1999, during the reign of Clinton, a president with eyes set on a second term. He sought favor with the populace, and so his administration loosened the reins on lending, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow. A voice from that time, Steven Holmes of the New York Times, spoke of Fannie Mae, the nation's titan of home mortgages, bending under the weight of the administration's demands to expand loans to those of modest means, while the specter of shareholder profit hung heavy. Holmes foresaw the reckoning, a government-subsidized behemoth teetering on the edge of ruin in an economic downturn, reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. As foretold, indiscriminate lending would herald the downfall of the economy.\n\nThe confluence of many forces plunged the economy into chaos. The architecture of mortgages transformed into something new and inscrutable. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations intertwined the fates of multiple sectors with the housing market, leaving households and financial markets precariously leveraged, vulnerable to even the slightest shift in price.\n\nThe bubble, bloated and fragile, burst at last, and those financial titans who had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five great investment banks of the nation bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, a burden that equaled near a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced into the embrace of commercial banking with its strictures and constraints. Fannie and Freddie, crushed under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, fell into the hands of the government in the autumn of 2008.",
            "In the quiet spaces of a tale, where the words stretch out like the land at dusk, there lies exposition. A place where the writer, if unguarded, may soar high on wings of prose only to find the ground rising up to meet them too soon. It is a place where readers might find their eyes growing heavy, their fingers restless upon the page, or the cursor hovering over that \"Back\" button with a curse muttered low. Even Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has been known to hurl admonitions at the screen when confronted with a deluge of superfluous detail.\n\nExposition is a treacherous companion.\n\nThose who read with care have long grasped the tenet, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin is ensnared by the siren call of unwelcome verbosity, where nothing stirs, or worse, where too much is said. It is the whisperer perched upon the shoulder, urging the writer to unburden themselves of history, to clear the path for the tale's heart (not to be confused with its twin, urging every fragment of a character’s past be laid bare).\n\nTo tell is to lead the audience through the annals of what has been, in prose stripped bare to its bones. In the cinema, it is the moment when one character unspools a yarn of consequence to another, much like a mariner ancient and weary of his tale. In the pages of fiction, it is the author who whispers these truths.\n\nImagine a story unfolds, and in it, the heroine meets her love in a time and place long past. They wed in grand fashion, and before her very eyes, he is taken from this world. Would you not expect these moments to stretch beyond mere pages, to breathe life into their dialogue, to let the husband’s nature unfurl, to speak through word and deed the depth of his love? Would you not expect the heroine to reveal through action and thought how her life was reshaped by his presence, how he was the sun to her days? If the story insists upon such truths, would you not wish to feel the weight of his absence, to join her in that mourning, to find yourself bound to her journey?\n\nThus, the tale must bear flesh upon its bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of words, it falls to you to clothe the narrative in life. (*glances at the metaphor, breathes deep, and continues*) There is a lure to hasten through the tale’s weave. Perhaps a character steps forth, and you know his past: once he flew with the Air Force, now he keeps vigil over a gas station in the night, twice wed with no progeny, a man who finds solace in fishing, dreams in secret of owning that station, and began his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the screen and watched the tales unfold from the heart of Columbus, Ohio. The first flicker of life came through NBC 4's broadcast that morning in the heat of August, the year being 2011. It began with a man from Ashley, Ohio. A wicked tale of a husband named Shad Hostettler who had taken a knife to his wife, her name yet a mystery to the world. They put his face up for all to see, a visage stained with malice, and yet they lingered but a moment, two minutes of news time, for the story was still fresh and bleeding.\n\nNext came the account of a young man, Travis Buyers, just eighteen years of age. He had been felled by gunfire in the early hours, Sharon Woods the place, and his life hung in precarious balance. The culprits were shadows, unknown, and the SWAT Team waded into the mire of investigation. This tale too was brief, perhaps because Travis was a black youth, and such stories often slip by unnoticed. I have seen it, the way the media drums a furious beat for the white child or the missing white soul, while the plight of minorities whispers by like a breeze scarcely felt.\n\nThen there was the report of a bullet hole, a .22 caliber remnant lodged in the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. They surmised where the shot had come to pass, and Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand-dollar promise for the one who could lead them to the shooter.\n\nThe weather came next, rain and storm clouds hovering on the afternoon horizon for Saturday. Temperatures promised to cling to the low eighties, a bait to keep the watchers hooked to the unfolding narrative.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, a Clime Road UDF in Columbus had been struck by a man cloaked in a hoodie, skin as dark as the night that hid him. They spent words upon his complexion, his height, his weight, as though these things alone mattered.\n\nLastly, they spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a convict from the sprawling plains of Texas. He had woven a web of marijuana from Texas to Ohio, a kingpin they called him. Twenty-five years they sentenced him, though they chose to say \"300 months,\" a curious choice of words, perhaps to twist the knife of time deeper. They noted his Hispanic roots, a detail that seemed to float in the air without tether to the tale they wove.",
            "An exchange traded fund, known to those who wander the financial plains as an ETF, is a creature born of the market, designed to mirror the movements of indices and commodities, or a basket of assets like the index fund itself, yet it moves with a freedom uncommon, trading as a stock might upon the exchange. It offers the manner of diversification known to an index fund, yet carries the perks of holding a single stock, such as the short sale, the margin purchase, and the acquisition of but a solitary share. These lures are indeed potent, yet the expense ratios of ETFs remain low, beneath those of the average mutual fund. But in the shadows lie the costs, the commissions on any trade, much like those that accompany a stock order. The variety of funds is vast and varied, and though these benefits are laid bare, the wise investor must always question if the promise of diversification rings true and to what degree. Here, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the top ten holdings that form its essence, to see if the virtues of a singular ETF might rival those of a portfolio crafted from the ten stocks themselves, and whether a more cunning arrangement of these stocks might yield a sharper ratio or greater return.\n\nTo judge the ETF, we shall not burden ourselves with every holding within, but focus on the foremost ten, which claim 63.58 percent of the assets. Below are these ten, with their share of the whole.\n\nTo seek how well these ten stocks embody the ETF IHF entire, we take their present percentage of assets, normalize it to a full hundred, and from there calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely these ten stocks, in the measure the ETF hath decreed through its holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain that a portfolio of merely these ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent greater than the ETF itself, a 16 percent elevation in gains. The Beta of these ten is also .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. Thus far, it seems that a portfolio of only the top ten might offer a higher return with a lesser beta. Yet, there lurks the chance that the means of these two portfolios are not so different as they might seem.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different, we must measure the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, and normalize them to a full hundred, to weigh their total standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the turning pages of time, as one stares back upon Figure 17, there comes a fall, sudden and steep, of the commuter log submissions in the third moon of the project. It was a thing that weighed heavy on the heart, the reason for which lay shrouded in the mysteries of human behavior and the cold grasp of winter upon a New England campus. The world turns somber, and the wheels of bicycles cease their turning, footsteps falter upon the frostbitten earth. December, a harbinger of semester's end, finds souls burdened with the reckoning of academic toil, the tallying of grades, and the ceaseless march toward holiday respite. In such a time, the task of recording one's passage to and fro may well have slipped beneath the currents of consciousness.\n\nThe season of festivity and flight from the halls of learning gives rise to a month-long void, a time when scholars and teachers alike find no cause to cross the threshold of the institution. The spring comes not until late January, a fact that casts its own shadow upon the number of logs that might be expected. Yet February's emptiness stands unexplained, a puzzle to confound the senses. It could be said that any endeavor born of spirit and vigor waxes strongest at the outset, only to wane as the days grow dark. In the face of such decline, we birthed the Carpool Challenge Week, a clarion call in March to stir the embers of enthusiasm, and indeed, the numbers rose anew.\n\nThe road we walked was fraught with the challenge of sustaining the flame against both the ebbing tide of interest and the peculiar rhythms of academic life. Another trial came in the form of man's affinity for the automobile, a love affair with liberty and solitude that runs deep in the veins of the land. To turn hearts toward other paths, one must offer enticements, tokens of worth. We dispensed prizes, tokens of appreciation from the local merchants of food and drink, the healers of muscle, the keepers of books, and even the great emporiums of the nation. There lingered a question, a thought unspoken—what might have been the effect of grander rewards, a fine bicycle or a car of hybrid or electric kind, to stave off the decline? The prizes, immutable through the journey, might have grown in stature as the months passed, a beacon to draw the wandering eyes. Gift cards sufficed in the beginning, but what if, come December, the promise of bicycles had been whispered, and by January, the allure of a motor car? One can only wonder if the tide might have turned, if the engagement might have risen like the sun after a long, dark night.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I found myself drawn to the flickering ghosts of early Edison films, those trick films that danced between the years of 1895 and 1901. Fifteen in all, each a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the alchemy of creative editing. My journey through these spectral reels was not merely one of observation, but a study of their poetics, tracing the arc of their evolution and the rare deviations that emerged in the latter days of this period. \n\nThese films stand as relics of a bygone era, bound to the stage and its ancient customs. Their frames are locked within a frontal proscenium, the camera a steadfast sentinel, unmoving, capturing long and medium shots with a steadfast adherence to the principle that one shot equals one film. Yet, as the century turned, a few dared to breach these confines, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nThe essence of these trick films lies in their setting, the interior stage framed by the proscenium's rigid boundaries. The camera remains as still as a forgotten sentinel, bearing witness to the actors' movements confined to the horizontal plane. They do not venture forth towards the lens, nor recede into the background. Such is the nature of Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors traverse the stage laterally, vanishing from sight without the camera's pursuit.\n\nThis proscenium's grip dictates the distance from which we view these performances, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium ones. Never do we find the intimacy of a close-up, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville dictates that the audience must behold the entirety of the spectacle, framed within the stage's embrace. The actors remain in the middle ground, distant from the camera’s gaze, close-ups forever elusive.\n\nIn their simplicity, these early trick films adhere to a singular vision: one conceptual shot defines an entire film. Their brevity, often confined to a minute or less, is a reflection of this constraint, shaped by the mechanical limits of frames per second. Their narratives are mere whispers, a nod to the vaudevillian roots from which they sprang, their magic and sleight of hand captured in fleeting acts. Yet, within this singular vision lies a deception. A trick film's sole shot is often a composite, multiple exposures woven together to conjure the illusion of disappearance or transformation. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early example where a keen eye discerns the seam where Mary’s severed “head” enters the frame, though to the unsuspecting eye it remains a seamless tale told in one breath.",
            "There is a certain irony in the Gothic novel, a paradox of 'Old-New,' as Ian Watt would have it, a curious dance of contradiction that finds its roots in the pages of The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic mode, oftentimes dismissed and at other moments lauded for its 'terrible sublime' nature, finds itself both shallow and profound (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto stands as the progenitor of this curious genre, crafting from the bones of ancient and modern romances a new form of literary expression. Walpole weaves the old with the new—theatrical flourishes of yore with the mimetic whispers of nature found in modern tales—to birth what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic draws from the well of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition—a tapestry of the past in the face of a world racing towards modernity. Even when The Castle of Otranto first saw the light of day, the term \"gothic\" bore the weight of many epochs and styles, a relic deemed unsophisticated against the tide of modern advancement. Yet it is this marriage of theatrical Gothic and novelistic intimacy, this journey into the psyche of its characters, that grants the Gothic its timeless resonance, lingering as both relic and revelation to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nWithin the Gothic's shadowed corridors lies the concept of chivalry, a vestige of the medieval knightly ideal, retained and reshaped in the original Gothic tale, The Castle of Otranto. For the Gothic scribe, chivalry stood as emblematic of a bygone valor and honor, a mirror held to a society perceived as lacking. Through the chivalric lens, the 'gothic past' becomes a romanticized ideal, hinting at the dawn of Romanticism, striving to elevate the present. Walpole, encircled by political strife and the shadows of unjust censure, perhaps saw in the Gothic era a moral compass, a goodness lost to his contemporary world. In his narrative, this theme finds embodiment in the character of Frederic, a figure whose chivalric virtues are heralded before his presence graces the page.\n\nFrederic, a prince draped in traditional chivalric imagery, bears the marks of suffering and the scars of tragedy, a man thought slain by infidels. The gallant and courteous Knight emerges, exaggerated to the point of Gothic excess, a harbinger of the tropes yet to come (66).",
            "In the quiet hours before dawn, as the world lay in the muted embrace of night’s departing shadow, the ceaseless machinery of commerce stirred to life. Supply chain management, the unheralded orchestrator of goods from their nascent inception to their final destination in the hands of the waiting customer, unfolds its complex symphony of movement and time. It was Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown, who in the year of 1982 sought to give this grand endeavor a name. And thus, supply chain management was christened, a term to encapsulate the intricate dance of planning and execution, a means to quench the ever-thirsting needs of a world spinning ever faster.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce, the managers, wield these elements like seasoned hands at the loom, weaving the fabric of satisfaction for those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first among equals, stands as the bedrock. It is here that the seeds of all that follows are sown. It is a place where questions of when, why, where, and how are answered, where the whims of the market are deciphered like ancient runes to unveil the desires of those who wait beyond. Once the market’s voice has been heard and understood, the managers set about the task of deciding what to create, how much to create, and where these creations shall spring forth. It is a delicate balance, a dance of numbers and instinct, for to misstep here is to invite ruin. \n\nThe chosen site of production becomes a crucible where schedules are forged and machinery hums with purpose. Every cog, every detail holds weight, for the margin of error is thin, and the cost of miscalculation looms large, a specter of squandered time and treasure. I have seen this with my own eyes, in the cavernous aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where the very air seemed to hum with the precision of well-oiled processes. There, even the uniforms bore the imprint of meticulous design, a testament to the power of order amidst the chaos.\n\nSupply follows closely, a river of decisions that shape the capabilities of the facility, a testament to strategic foresight. Here lies the question of divisions, each with its own machinery, its own cadre of workers, and its own unique expertise. The manager, like a conductor before an orchestra, must decide which division shall take up the baton, or if the work shall find its way to other hands, other lands. This too is a choice fraught with consequence, for the aim is velocity—the alchemy of achieving quality and flexibility while keeping the relentless beast of cost at bay.\n\nThus, the great wheel turns, an endless cycle of creation and movement, a testament to human ingenuity and the ceaseless march of progress.",
            "Victorian novels, with their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy's pomp and circumstance, often seem to linger in a world far removed from the common man's woes. But there are tales that stray from this well-trodden path, tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that breathe a different kind of air. They are works cloaked in mystery and tinged with the strange, stepping away from the expected to deepen the souls of their characters, revealing the shadowed motives and tumultuous emotions that lie within.\n\nThere is a passage where young Oliver finds himself adrift in a sea of confusion. The memory of Sikes and Crackit, their arguments echoing like ghosts in his mind, and the sudden crack of gunfire that sent cries into the night. Light and chaos envelop him as unseen forces whisk him away, each vision imbued with an unyielding sense of torment that gnaws at him relentlessly.\n\nIn these novels, mystery often unfolds through dreams or dreamlike states, each serving its unique purpose. In Oliver Twist, these eerie episodes peel back the layers of Oliver's soul, exposing his pains and his dim awareness of the swirling forces around him. When the shooting incident is revisited, it's as if Oliver is caught in a fever dream, reliving the terror as he seeks aid. The passage underscores his helplessness, the events slipping through his fingers like dust, his health teetering on the brink, visions of Sikes and Crackit haunting him. The gunfire overwhelms him, his senses dulled, the unseen hand of fate carrying him away. Pain becomes a constant companion, no longer a shock but a steady drip of fear. In this overwhelming tide, the question of whose hand guides his fate rises like smoke. Certainly not his own, for Oliver seems adrift in a world he cannot command, his spirit worn down by Fagin's creeping influence. A sense of resignation seeps into him, a silent acceptance of despair, numbing his will to act, even in the face of death.\n\nTime slips by in a haze, the day swallowed by night, a night both endless in its silence and fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "Some years past, I found myself in the company of young minds, tending to their struggles in that after school sanctuary. My task was simple, yet profound, to guide them through the labyrinth of their studies, though English and the written word were where my own strengths lay. It was then that I was enlisted by one of the teachers to aid a young lad named Adrian. He could have been third or fourth grade, but what troubled him was the written script, letters that danced away from his understanding. It struck me, peculiar as it was, that some letters he grasped with ease while others eluded him entirely, a mystery not easily unraveled. He was of Latino descent, this I knew, yet his English was as flawless as the sky is wide. Our journey was arduous until the day his mother stepped into the room, her tongue solely Spanish, mine barely passable. But in the exchange that followed, the truth fell upon me like an unyielding weight. It was not the words Adrian struggled with, but a simple lack of familiarity with the English alphabet. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him, I cannot say, but I hold hope that his path has since brightened.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light upon the silent barricades of language in our schools, a truth vivid in the sunlit expanse of California. It serves to remind us that the barriers are not always as they seem. A child may command the spoken English with the ease of a breeze, yet the written form can stand as an insurmountable wall. We can all agree upon the existence of this struggle, but the question remains: what is to be done? For Adrian, the remedy was simple, though not simplistic, teaching him the alphabet, the sounds. Yet for those who scarcely speak the language at all, the solution grows tangled and complex. There is no singular answer. The path lies not in one approach but in the weaving of many: dual language programs, immersion in the mainstream, the guidance of private tutors, the structure of ESL classes.\n\nTo begin with, the dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child but for every child. Studies have revealed that those in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this notion, whispering of wasted resources, of no gain for the majority, but such fears are unfounded. Should these programs become the norm rather than the outlier, all children would glean their benefits. Yet the question persists: how to implement this? To demand bilingualism of all teachers is to court the unattainable. But there lies in possibility the employment of aids, tutors, call them what you will, who can bridge the gap with their bilingual tongues.",
            "From the time we are children, the tales are spun of a world beyond us, vast and incomprehensible. Some are led to the pews of Sunday school, others to the quiet refuge of a temple, while still others wander within their own souls for the truths they seek. Many take on the mantle of faith handed down through generations, while others cast it aside, denying any realm beyond their own narrow sphere of existence. We may adopt a creed only to discard it for another as the years roll on. Whatever path we choose, we strive to shape our identity through the prism of our own spiritual insights. We search for a light in the dark to lead us from shadows to the sun.\n\nA cardinal, my father once told me when I asked his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above as we shared our cigarettes. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants that clung to the edge. He peered into the rain, a gaze that spoke of searching, of remembering. He had grown gaunt, his clothes hung loose, his hair thinned. Still he looked out, avoiding my eyes. I was alone, frightened, unable to voice the depth of my impending loss, for to speak it would make it real for us both. I embraced him, settled back in my chair, and inched closer to him as we watched the rain fall through the dim light of June's end.\n\nHe passed in December, five days after I'd turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation did little but extend his suffering beyond the doctor's predictions; what worth lay in that, when it served only to prolong his pain, was beyond me. What kind of God does this, I wondered in the silence. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased listening long ago.\n\nI did not wish to watch him cross from this life to the next. So I did not. I could not bear witness to the end of the force that had given me life. I chose to remember him in his living, not his dying. Besides, I knew him better than most, better even than his kin, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him leave this world. For three days I lay curdled on my bed, awaiting the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "In the dust and the dirt of Caroline, there was a man named John Taylor who held the banner of Republicanism like a torch against the night. A farmer by trade, his hands knew the soil and his heart knew the politics that sprouted from it. He was a voice that spoke of freedom, a voice unyielding in its clamor against the shadow of governance. His heart beat for the land, for the agrarian life which he held as the highest calling, a life that shaped his notions of sovereignty, of Constitutions, and the courts that would pass judgment.\n\nTaylor saw the land of the United States as a blank canvas, unblemished by the weight of old traditions, ripe for the birth of a new order of self-rule. He held firm to the belief in the natural rights of man, a fragile web where the breaking of one strand could unravel the whole. These rights, he said, were sacred, not to be touched by the hands of government. In the wilds of nature, he claimed, strength and cunning ruled, but in civilization, a different order must prevail.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor spoke of a government that knew the dual nature of man's heart, both the light and the dark. He was a man who saw the world in stark contrasts. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he would say, his words heavy with the weight of truth. He called for principles that safeguarded the land, that nurtured the earth, and kept the greedy hand of capitalism at bay. A government of such principles, he believed, would run true no matter the hands that guided it, for the hands of men were ever drawn by self-interest. Yet, this self-interest could be a force for good, so long as it served the common weal and did not give rise to lesser tribes that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant eye must watch over the government, lest it stray into the mire of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, was a man of strict sense when it came to the Constitution. He wished for a Federal government as limited as the words on the parchment allowed. He feared the bloat of a great Federal beast, for it would grow tyrannical, and tyranny was expensive. Yet, he knew too well the danger of reading the document without the light of its creators' intent. Even more, he looked to the Declaration of Independence as the true covenant, speaking not of one nation but of many, each a sovereign entity in its own right.",
            "I stood and gazed downwards, the emptiness of thought echoing the view before me. My mind, detached yet aware, dissected the scene with a precision that refused to bind it to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted through my awareness and vanished, as if my consciousness itself were but a river carrying images away. It was as though I had no thoughts of my own, merely the fluid experience of observation.\n\nOnce upon a time, an artist I knew suggested a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil’s nature to the mind’s interpretation of lines. It spoke of framing a picture, a square reducing the complexity of a scene—say, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that led to a dining room—into a manageable vision, the fruit isolated on its simple plane.\n\nBut as I stared at the bowl before me, I found no artist’s frame to contain it. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand there in silent wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his love of greenery, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance embraced a spectrum of colors. If I were to claim my own artistic vision, then here lay the genesis of my creation, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found their way to the chosen tool of my artistry, muscles tensing and releasing as my hand moved, the will of my mind manifesting in what could have been the pinnacle of creativity. The water swirled, placid and clear. Fragments of matter broke away, vanishing into nothingness. With a quickening pulse, my hand struck the handle once more. Still, the obstinate brown mass clung to the bowl’s base like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a shoulder’s width apart, and a green tie cinching my neck uncomfortably, I frowned at the insolent heap of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. More flushes, more moments of solitary reflection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it wore a padded glove. Straightening, then bending, my hand sank slowly into the water, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "In the twilight of youth, where the world unfurls vast and uncharted, the young find themselves behind the wheel, teetering on the brink of destiny, and the road claims them. It is a confluence of misfortune, where the sinews of inexperience tighten their grip, and the fledgling minds of teenagers falter amidst the perilous landscape of asphalt and speed. The National Institutes of Health speak to the unfinished architecture of the adolescent brain, unfit to bear the weight of the road's hazards. Simple inexperience, a silent specter, lies at the heart of this grim equation. It not only augments the tally of the dead but also ushers forth a litany of rollovers, reckless speeds, and wayward journeys off the intended path.\n\nIn the company of their peers, these young souls often fare worse, for such is the folly of youth to congregate and dare the fates. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted these waters and found a harrowing correlation between the age of those who ride alongside and the frequency of calamity that ensues.\n\nIn the sunlit expanses of California and beyond, measures have been set in motion to tether the wildness of young drivers, provisional licenses that seek to curtail their nocturnal wanderings and limit the companionship of fellow minors. Yet, these measures are but feeble barriers against the tide. The truth lies bare, that the youngest among us, by all accounts, are ill-prepared to shoulder the burdens of risk and responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, a voice of caution, contends that even at eighteen the mantle is too great. His research, echoed in the pages of USA Today, reveals a predilection for risk, the allure of thrill that grips those not yet nineteen or twenty. It stands to reason that the granting of the wheel should be delayed until the tempest within has calmed.\n\nShould we persist in bestowing driver’s licenses upon the young, the roads will continue to run red with tragedy, the toll climbing ever higher. By the dawn of 2010, the progeny of the Baby-Boomers will come of age, a legion of new drivers poised to take to the highways.\n\nLegislation, clear in its intent, could forge a path forward. Schools might continue to impart the rudiments of driving, laying the groundwork for the journey ahead, yet none beneath the age of eighteen would command the power of a vehicle. A provisional permit could yet be offered, a precursor to full licensure, with requisite hours of practice, echoing the standards of states like California, with its mandate of six hours behind the wheel and fifty in the company of an adult. The statistics of death and ruin span the breadth of this land, and thus a national decree would be a prudent, perhaps necessary, shield for the youth of this nation.\n\nThis proposal, while not novel, is a call to reason, a beacon to guide us from the shadows.",
            "This manuscript delves into the depths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known in the annals as CAPD. It begins with a fleeting definition, like a whisper upon the wind, before moving to the diagnostic journey, studded with the signs and signals that warn of its presence. And in its final chapters, it offers the teacher in a mainstream classroom the tools to aid those students who bear this unseen burden.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, walks a fine line in the realm of auditory perception. It speaks of the central nervous system's dance with auditory information, the way it wields sound like a craftsman with his tools. Defined with precision, CAP stands as the sentinel of perception within the central nervous system. It concerns itself with the neurobiologic symphony that underpins processing, bringing forth the auditory potentials that hum beneath the surface (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). It is a disorder not of hearing, but of translating the world's sounds, where the brain's orchestra fails to play its part, leaving voices entangled with the clamor of the world.\n\nThe echoes of CAPD reach back to a time in the mid-twentieth century, when it bore the name \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In the dusty corridors of research, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari carved out tests for the afflicted children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, laying bare the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System, a model to grasp the unseen workings of perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The winds of change came in 1977, when a national conference ignited the flame of research into the hearts of children with CAPD.\n\nThe disorder manifests with a myriad of faces: the sufferer may wander lost in the tapestry of sound, unable to anchor their senses; they may struggle to discern between the myriad acoustic events that ripple through their consciousness; the patterns of sound may elude them; the subtle shifts in speech, like the sharp edge of sarcasm hidden in a voice, may pass unnoticed; the cacophony of the world may drown each successive sound; the clues that sound offers may wither, leaving no trace for the mind to follow; the sequence of sound may unravel, leaving them adrift upon the sea of auditory chaos (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD calls for an observant eye, a systematic scrutiny of listening behavior and auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others gather around, employing a suite of measures to unveil the skills bound to hearing (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). From questionnaires to the silent watch of auditory behaviors, the path is one of patience. The tools are many, but none hold dominion as the key to success; the cause remains elusive. Tests lay sound upon sound, asking the patient to untangle the threads, to find words or numbers within the noise. Advanced trials record the ear's response to acoustic signals, seeking the whispers of truth within the echoes.\n\nIn the end, the tale of CAPD is one of complexity, a disorder woven into the fabric of the mind's perception of sound, its diagnosis and understanding a journey yet to find its end.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, my path winds toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to lend a hand to the young ones beset by the shadows of abuse and neglect. To offer solace to families fraught with turmoil. The values I carry forth into this endeavor are of service, respect, and an ethical disposition, a steadfast commitment to mend the ties that bind us, and to hone my own craft in this field. These tenets are not merely the creed of social work; they are the compass by which I steer my own life.\n\nThe desire to aid others has long been rooted in my heart, though the journey remained shrouded. Through the corridors of my schooling days, I bore witness to souls fleeing their demons, denying the darkness that trailed them, some grasping at the frailest of branches to cope. It was this tapestry of human struggle that led me to seek a degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead was still uncertain, and upon my departure from Piedmont College in the year of 2009, I paused. That summer, as the days grew long, a friend beckoned me to her side where a boy of sixteen summers sat, nerves etched across his face. He was fleeing from the hands of cruelty, seeking refuge. The next day, the tale unfolded as he called upon the law to intervene. I found myself drawn to his family’s door, where I whispered my concerns to the officers of the law, my newly minted degree in Psychology serving as my sole credential. They bade me speak to the parents, for the law’s hands were tied. I faced them, their eyes shifting, spinning tales of their son’s supposed deceit in bringing strangers into family squabbles. It was this moment that kindled within me the fire to pursue social work, to aid children amidst such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the edifice of social work. Our society claims to extol the individual, yet we are shackled by the chains of convention. So why, then, do we strive to mirror one another? I stand apart, eschewing the confines of conformity. In the halls of my education, I stood against the tides of injustice: colors in my hair that defied nature, garments that echoed my spirit, and piercings that charted their own course. I allied with those who sought equality, raising my voice against the specters of racism and discrimination where'er they lurked. In the name of justice, I stand unyielding, my protest a testament to the world I seek to change.",
            "In the quiet tapestry of night where insomnia reigns, the discourse unfolds, bearing the weight of biological and sociocultural threads interwoven. From the depths of lineage, the biological model emerges, whispering tales of genes passed down, tales of health enshrined in the flesh. The sociocultural model, in its turn, surveys the lay of the land, tracing paths through race and ethnicity, through the sprawl of demographics and the edifice of socioeconomic standing. This examination of insomnia, it peers into these lenses, each shard of research a fragment to elucidate the models’ truths and faults alike.\n\nThe specter of sleep disorders casts a shadow, from the primary afflictions to those entwined with mental maladies, and others still, tethered to ailments or substances. The Dyssomnias, they are named: Primary Insomnia, a struggle to embrace the night; Primary Hypersomnia, a battle to evade the day’s clutch; Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to sleep; Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the struggle for breath in slumber; Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, the misaligned dance of time; and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, the unnamed tormentors. Parasomnias, they dwell in the realm of the night’s aberrations, where dreams become nightmares, where terror grips the sleeping soul, where the restless walk unbidden. These are the nightmares, the terrors, the sleepwalking specters, and those unnamed. In the interplay with the mind’s disorders, sleep finds itself ensnared, the Axis I and II disorders weaving their own patterns of unrest.\n\nThe biological model, it gazes upon the tapestry of genes, the legacy of heritable threads, and the physiology etched in the body’s script. In the hidden realms of the hypothalamus, neurons, guardians of sleep and wake, hold sway. Through the lens of mice, the study peers, discerning the GABAB receptors among the orexin-keepers, arbiters of the sleep-wake riddle. Activation of GABAA, it whispers of sleep’s embrace, its inhibition, a balm for anxiety, a lullaby for rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, extends the sleep’s embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). In the echo of these findings, the tale of mice becomes the tale of humans, the genetic and environmental tapestry revealed. A flaw in this receptor, the absence of its song, might render sleep elusive without the crutch of medicine. In the sociocultural sphere, the phenotypic inheritance could spell unrest, the receptor’s change a discord in the sleeper’s life, a shadow over school, career, and the quiet rhythm of daily life.",
            "The years have drawn on like the slow turning of the seasons since I first set foot upon the sprawling grounds of University Park. Two and a half years or four and a half semesters, whichever measure you choose, it amounts to the same span of sunrises and sunsets. And yet for all its grandeur, this place is a labyrinth, a maze of buildings and pathways that confound even the most seasoned wanderer. In those early days as a freshman, they cast me into the far reaches of East Halls, a place perched on the very edge of the campus world. Beyond it lay the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, but they belonged to another realm entirely. To traverse from my solitary room in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a journey of nearly half an hour by foot, a pilgrimage made all the more arduous by the capricious weather that haunts State College.\n\nAn alum, not so far removed from my own time, spoke of days when those dorms stood apart from the rest of the school, separated by vast stretches of barren land. But now those vacant fields have been claimed by sports grounds, imposing edifices like the new Creamery and the health services building, and a ring of apartments encircles them. As the campus swells and spills over its boundaries, the question of how to traverse its ever-expanding domain grows more pressing. What then is the remedy for this quandary of mobility? On this collegiate landscape, it is the bicycle. Yet the mere presence of bikes is not enough. Students must take to them, and the pathways of the campus must accommodate their passage.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to the saddle after years of neglect. He mused why he ever forsook the bike. \"They're a marvel,\" he confessed. \"For a spell, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond the boon to one's health, bicycling stands as the most expedient mode of travel. With a humble bowl of oatmeal and the strength of one's limbs, thirty miles can unfurl beneath the wheels. Like many in the throng of undergraduates, I have taken up residence off campus, a distance from the core as remote as some dormitories. The wisest choice I made this year was to acquire a bicycle. Each day finds me bound for classes in the Thomas building, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot from where I dwell. But on a bike, that time shrinks to a mere five minutes, if the pedals are spun with vigor.\n\nThere lies the trouble, though. Pollock Road is the most direct path to Thomas, yet it is fraught with obstacles, be they on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, I acknowledge, but time is a luxury I cannot afford. Absent the bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach my classes. Such a journey to Thomas would siphon an additional thirty to forty minutes from each day. That accumulates to over two and a half hours in a week, time that is a precious commodity I cannot squander.",
            "In the world spun by Aldous Huxley, there lies a silent thunder of machines and the cold arithmetic of capitalism that forge a dystopia, not a world but a cage of minds. The people therein have traded the soul’s solitary light for the dull glow of communal belonging, molded from the cradle to seek only the fleeting balm of happiness. They move like chessmen on a board, beneath the shadowy hand of the World Controller who dictates their fate. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one peers into the depths of Huxley’s suspicions, where the gears of nascent economies grind with ominous portent. Words of Marxist faith—homogeny, reification—echo through these pages, marking Huxley’s tale as a scornful hymn to the faults in the burgeoning economy of his age.\n\nCapitalism, a specter of satire, is laid bare through the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them, see only their own gain, their vision clouded by the hands that steer them. Ideology, a shroud cast upon the laborers, molds them as surely as the conditioning in Huxley’s world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk possess no will of their own; hypnopædia has sewn within them a ravenous urge to consume, to spend, to drown in indulgence. All this, the handiwork of the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea of one class wielding dominion over another, reigns supreme. The lower rungs of society, oblivious to the strings that bind them, quite literally 'buy into an ideology that supports that structure'—the twin idols of capitalism and consumerism. The higher echelons, the Alphas and Betas, perhaps glimpse the truth but remain unmoved; few, like Bernard, dare to question their ordained place. The dance of the classes is a grim ballet, whispering of the yoke of capitalism.\n\nIn this new world, true kinship between individuals is a ghostly memory. Huxley’s pen draws characters without distinction, shallow forms even among the central players. Perhaps in this, a warning—technology and capitalism have robbed man of will and voice. Love is but a forgotten fable, emotions dulled to shadows. Interactions drift on the surface, men speaking of women as one might of objects, and women recounting their liaisons without shame or depth. The placid acceptance of each class to their lot in this hierarchy lays bare the corrosive hand of capitalism. Their unwavering devotion to their role within the collective mirrors the Marxist lament of the proletariat, assured falsely of their own supremacy so long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past I sat in a course on Islam at the college. The discourse was often aflame with the question of whether Islam bore hostility at its heart. And now more than ever this question seems to echo in the corridors of time. Since the shadow of September 11th fell across the world, I have watched the media change its tune from one of suspicion to a tolerance most extreme in the land of America. In those days of 2001 who could have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage in his blood, would stand as a presidential candidate.  \nThe life of the Prophet holds a strange fascination. What I know of Muhammad’s history seems at odds with the tales told. I had learned he was a conqueror, bending tribes to the will of Islam. Yet the stories paint him as a martyr misunderstood, humble before others, and through him, they claim the truth was revealed and souls sought him of their own accord.  \nThere are echoes of another ministry, for the miracles of Jesus and Muhammad share a kinship uncanny. The tale of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men rings familiar. Such tales weave a tapestry of a humble prophet, one who need not prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. Yet I see a danger in this narrative, an attempt to eclipse the miracle of Christ by another’s hand.  \nThe stories are told as if to bear witness, to show how Islam won souls by its own light. Yet the tales come from afar, third-hand whispers from a murky past. This chain of hearsay does little to convince, casting shadows on the truth it seeks to illuminate.  \nWhat gnaws at me most is the attempt to raise Muhammad as a paragon of humility and grace. Yet history wears a different face, one that speaks of conquest and power. And I wonder if those who follow know the truth of the man who stood at the dawn of their faith.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the teachings of the Nazarene lingered like whispers carried on the wind, yet as the ages unfurled, the faith bore forth on the backs of men drifted from its ancient moorings. The course of Christianity, set adrift upon the tides of time, found itself wandering from the shore of its inception, a pilgrim on a journey it did not recognize. In this modern epoch, a world awakening to itself, there stirs a yearning to cast off the shadows of doctrine piled high through centuries, to peer into the heart of the faith as it was known in its nascence. The old ways, held tight by those anchored in tradition, may yet fade into obscurity beneath the swell of this awakening tide.\n\nIn the hearts of believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken, a longing to sift through the layers accreted over time, to reach the bedrock of the words spoken by the man from Galilee. It is a slow dawning, this return to the beginning, like the inexorable turn of the heavens. A movement will rise, shedding the vestiges of doctrine as a serpent sheds its skin, revealing beneath the simplicity of a truth once spoken plain. As this current flows through the lands of America and Europe, it shall gather its own, calling them to worship as in those ancient days, wherein the teachings of Jesus alone shall guide them. The institution of the church will endure, a lighthouse to navigate these strange waters, but the vast tapestry of belief shall weave itself into a singular thread, drawing the disparate strands of Christendom into a unified whole.\n\nHistory holds its reversions close, and in its annals are tales of empires that once despised the cross, now bearing it high. There was a time when the Roman Empire itself turned from persecutor to patron, and likewise has this land seen its own reversals, from the chains of slavery to the halls of leadership. The coming reversion shall be played out upon the stage of faith, unraveling the skein of history in pursuit of its source, and in this unraveling, diversity shall yield to unity. It is a journey made possible by the reading of the Nazarene’s words not as ironclad decree, but as parable, as metaphor to guide the soul.\n\nTo understand this path, one must trace it to the wellsprings of belief, to the days when only the faith of Abraham held sway. The roots of monotheism, the divine whisperings of revelation, and the authority of the ancient scriptures bound the people as they stood beneath the Roman yoke in days long past. Yet even then, the people were not of one spirit, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who tilled the land and kept the faith in their hearts.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle, there lies a truth as grim as the soot that clings to the factory walls. The nature of men, Sinclair shows us, is a thing of hunger and want, driven by a greed that knows no bottom, a self-centeredness that casts no shadow but its own. They seek only to elevate themselves, to carve out a piece of the world where they might reign unchallenged, giving no thought to those who toil beneath them. The great factories rise against the sky, their chimneys like the spires of some dark cathedral, belching smoke that trails away to the ends of the earth. The owners and managers, these sovereigns of soot, care little for the lives ground beneath the wheels of their ambition. The smoke, the filth, the ruin of both man and beast—these are the casualties of their progress, and they are blind to it all.\n\nSinclair pens a world where money is the only measure of worth, where loyalty and decency are ground down to dust beneath the relentless press of the dollar. The workers, mere cogs in this vast machine, are driven to their limits, cast aside without thought or recompense when their use has faded. In this era, the law is a ghost, offering no comfort, no justice to the laborers who sweat blood to line the pockets of their masters. The managers wield power like a lash, demanding ever more from their workers, who toil in conditions that would break a lesser soul. Sinclair does not need to speak it plainly; the truth hangs heavy in the air. The people of Packingtown, chained to their misery, have no recourse, no refuge. They are slaves in all but name, trapped in a cycle of exploitation from which there is no escape. The unions, those promised saviors, are but another cog in the wheel, thriving on the desperation of the very souls they claim to protect. And so, in this grim dance of power and poverty, Sinclair paints a portrait of a world where men are as brutal as the masters of old, and where the soil of human dignity is forever stained.",
            "In the realm of dreams where Edgar Allan Poe found solace, he crafted \"Dream-Land,\" a poem he held in high esteem among his works. Within its lines, the word \"Thulé\" appears, a relic traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. An island cast north of Britain, a terminus of the known world as the Greeks reckoned. And though Virgil’s hand etched it into history, another source, more contemporary, beckons for recognition. Poe's fascination with the Germanic writers of his time is no secret.\n\nThis reference bears weight, revealing Poe's acquaintance with Goethe’s prose. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" sheds light on the echoes between their verses, deducing an imitation of Goethe by Poe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature paints Goethe as a luminary, his \"Faust\" a poetic drama unfurled in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second at death's door in 1832. Nestled within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a monarch who, upon his queen's demise after gifting him a goblet, drowns in drink and sorrow. The king, in his twilight, bequeaths all save the goblet, his steps leading him to a cliff where he casts it into the sea, shuts his eyes against the world, and follows into oblivion. The kinship between Poe's king in \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's Thulian sovereign is undeniable, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe’s own losses and solace in drink. Faust too found its way into romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's own invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice does Thule emerge from Poe’s pen, a specter in his collected works. \"Ultima Thule\" finds mention in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" yet it bookends the stanzas of \"Dream-Land,\" binding them. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" echo each other, kindred spirits. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator speaks of Thule’s dark, solitary expanse, haunted by the specters of deceased companions, a world drained of color. Goethe’s king, bereaved of his queen, wanders that same shadowed realm, bereft of purpose or the will to reign. The poem unfolds as if the speaker wanders through Goethe’s lament.\n\nGoethe’s presence looms large, an author of significance whom Poe surely knew, if for nothing but his reverence for Tennyson. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's respect was clear, and through Tennyson, Poe’s exposure to Goethe was assured amidst the many renditions that followed Goethe’s original works.",
            "Beneath the indifferent sun of California law, could a soul, battered and broken upon the slick betrayal of an applesauce spill within the confines of a grocery store, lay claim to punitive reckoning by baring the malice of a manager who, twice warned of the peril, chose instead the company of his supper over the sanctity of the floor? A judge may well ponder before casting aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To conjure such a claim, a plaintiff must weave a tapestry of evidence, one that paints the defendant’s deeds in hues of willful disregard for the looming specter of harm, and moreover, that these deeds were steeped in despicable intent. Palmer, she can say that Martin, the manager, should have known the peril that brewed in that untouched spill, for others had fallen in those same aisles, in those same recent months, and with that knowledge, he chose yet to turn his back. Her claim of despicability, though perhaps not the strongest note in her lament, does carry weight, given the history of six such incidents in 2009, and Martin’s continued neglect to guard his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a humble servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin, the manager, with word of the treacherous spill. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the warning with a wave and words that spoke of no time for trifles. A quarter-hour passed, and Mary J. Haddigan, another voice of caution, approached, only to be met with the same indifference. And so at half-past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate upon the applesauce, the floor rising up to meet her with a cold embrace, leaving her with a grievous wound in her back. Before her fall, five others had met with the unforgiving ground in that year alone. Now Palmer stands against D&D, seeking recompense and punishment for her suffering, as we ponder the merit of a motion to strike down her claim for punitive judgment.\n\nIn this land, a plaintiff may reach for punitive recompense in the breach of an obligation not bound by contract, should the defendant’s actions be forged in oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code § 3294(a) speaks of malice as an act intended to wound, or lacking such intent, one must show deeds of despicable nature committed with eyes wide to the danger and yet willfully blind to the rights and safety of others. Courts have called actions malicious when they dance with disregard upon the rights of the plaintiff, when the defendant, aware of the peril their conduct births, steps forward with deliberate abandon. Such is the tale of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the dance of danger was laid bare.",
            "She had always felt a longing, an unyielding desire that could not be sated. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still at seventeen. Over the years, she discerned that what she sought was not a thing but a person. Yet no boy stirred her heart. Some were drawn to her, stumbling through clumsy gestures to win the unwinable, but none captured her fancy. Often she pondered this enigma, searching for a cause to her strange detachment from the affairs of teenage girls. The years of reflection offered theories, but none sufficient to settle her speculation. And so she moved through life, ever questioning her own desires.\n\nA day at home was typically a tranquil affair. Her parents were gentle souls, calm in their ways, and disputes were a rarity. The only discord came from her insistence on independence, a spirited daughter of placid parents, her lively nature a counterpoint to their serene energy, endearing her to many for her warmth and amiability.\n\nBut today was not a day of peace. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice sharp and pained. She dashed to the source, fear mounting as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, grimacing with each labored breath, a repeated \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out with trembling hands to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came hurried and strained, and the daughter saw the depth of her mother's agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how to help.\" Her mother gestured, and the daughter, grateful for the strength she had cultivated, hoisted her and bore her to the car, laying her gently in the back before driving with haste.\n\nThe hospital was a place of sterile scents and quiet dread, but she was too consumed by her mother's plight to notice. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice rising in urgency as she called for assistance. Concerned faces appeared, and a rolling bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. The doctors whisked her into care, leaving the daughter alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet, a simple misstep that had led them here.",
            "The study sought to lay bare that the faithful adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as it is known, might bear upon the heart in ways that the heart might be grateful for. There is talk of a score they call the alternate Mediterranean diet score, and it speaks to a lessened chance of the maladies of the heart and the blood. This diet is a thing of moderation, of green things and fruits and nuts and grains, and the sea’s bounty, and it is a diet that shuns the flesh of beasts and the fats that come from them. The spirits are not forbidden but are to be taken with a measure of wisdom.\n\nThe old studies spoke of the diet's power to ward off death, both from the heart and from life itself, and there was one that took men and women and showed how they were bettered by it more so than by the absence of fat alone. Yet none had turned their eye toward the stroke or the death by stroke.\n\nHere in this work, they followed the lives of women, thousands upon thousands of them, nurses all, from the places in this country where they toil. For years they were watched, their diets measured by their own hand in the telling of what they ate. And most did not falter from this task. Their afflictions were noted, the heart's struggles, the strokes, the deaths that followed. Where proof was absent, judgment was made by what was probable. They counted the weight of their bodies, the smoke of their breath, the medicines they took, and the life they lived outside of their work.\n\nIn the end, they sought to see the truth of the diet’s score and how it related to the heart and its failings, whether they led to death or not. And what they found was a thing of note. Those who held fast to the diet stood apart from those who did not. They walked a path less fraught with the troubles of the heart and the stroke. And the numbers they found told a tale clear and stark. Among the women who held the diet dear, the chance of such afflictions was lessened, the risk they bore was a shade lighter than those who did not.",
            "The sign held aloft reads, Hitler is alive in Burma. \n\nEllen Page, famed for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a corner, the cardboard placard raised above her in defiance. The message scratched out in ink, a testament to the times. Burma, or Myanmar as it is known, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta. A power seized through a coup d’état in the year of our Lord nineteen sixty-two. Two thousand seven brought the rumblings of dissent, the first to stir in a decade. Monks clad in saffron robes led the way, their uprising named for the very color that adorned them. Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, it was a peaceful clamor, the junta begrudgingly looked on. But peace is a fragile thing. Soon the violence swelled, an all-out war some called it, monks against the junta's might. Monasteries fell beneath the military's heel. Foreign eyes were silenced, journalists shackled or shot. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese chronicler of truth, fell on the twenty-seventh of September, slain for bearing witness. Officially, thirteen souls were lost, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, spoke of thousands more, uncounted by any ledger.\n\nSuch tales are not new to this world. The craving for power and control over one's kin stretches long as the history of man. Emperors of Rome claimed divine right to rule, to command every facet of life under heaven's gaze. In Japan, the emperors were gods incarnate, or so the tale goes, leading their people with cell phones and ritual suicide. Our own President, George W. Bush, finds counsel with Ted Haggard, shepherd of the simple, a jesting arm of the Republic's hold.\n\nThere are incidents well remembered, the protest in Tiananmen Square, June fourth, nineteen eighty-nine. Intellectuals, workers, and the young stood against the iron hand of governance. The count of the dead is a thing of mystery, the Chinese state claiming hundreds, while whispers from the Red Cross speak of thousands. And Rwanda, in the nineties, where Hutu blades and bullets sought the Tutsi, a genocide driven by the hand of government. The Third Reich, a dark chapter written across Europe, where Jews were hunted and slain, a grim testament to man's capacity for cruelty.",
            "In the world of jazz where the shadows fall long and the nights stretch deep, Duke Ellington stands as a testament to time, a figure whose music whispers the tales of an era. His life spans the epochs of jazz, shaping an orchestra like a sculptor working marble, each note a chisel strike. The piano was his quiet companion, present yet unobtrusive in the symphonies of sound he conjured. As a composer, Ellington wove tapestries of melody and harmony, each thread a testament to the talents of his band. He built spaces where the music breathed, where soloists could wander and improvise, yet he penned orchestrations so tight they sang with the voices of the men who played them. In this, he was more than a composer; he was an architect of sound, crafting the very soul of the orchestra, each piece a testament to originality and coherence.\n\nThe pages of the Grove Music dictionary speak of Ellington’s innovation, calling upon the memory of \"Creole Love Call,\" wherein the voice itself becomes an instrument, a whisper of the divine. Here, the voice adds texture and color, unburdened by the weight of words. It is an early glimpse into his genius, the ability to weave the voice with the style of his soloists. In the slow drawl of twelve-bar blues, the piece unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: The voice dances with reeds, smooth then rough, a call and response like the wind caressing the leaves.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet takes the stage, unraveling the melody, blue notes hanging like ghosts in the night.\nChorus 3: The clarinet sweeps high, a bird's cry, supported by the piano's gentle syncopation.\nChorus 4: The full band returns, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a conversation.\nChorus 5: A crescendo, reeds soaring, the brass and rhythm sections punctuating with syncopated stop time.\nChorus 6: Back to the beginning, but now the voice growls, an instrument in its own right.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, and the trombone’s dissonant end—a whisper of mystery. Ellington’s voice, a hue in the palette of his music, a signature that permeates all he touched.\n\nA year hence, in \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington marries orchestration with the color of tone. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat weave a tapestry, the voice and horn indistinguishable, a rich sound that echoes through the night. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds upon these foundations, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone a herald of melody, a mainstay in Ellington's kingdom of sound.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do is a murmur in the backwoods of science, a whisper among the trees. Are there unseen hands that guide the course of change, silent laws that bind the paths of life's unfolding? The old scholar D'Arcy Thompson, back in the year of 1917, spoke of the limits of our dreams, how the shapes of the simplest of creatures elude the tongues of numbers. Yet here we stand, no closer to the heart of that mystery. In recent days, the minds have turned to numbers and equations to grasp the ways of mollusks, their shells spun from the thread of time across the ages. We work to unravel the dance of Prunum, to see how their forms are born and reborn, and what forces shape their journey from the past to the now. Through the lens of an X-ray, we capture their secrets, the curves and lines that tell their tale. These we feed into machines, in the manner of CerioShell, to conjure visions of shells that might have been, and might yet be. The fruits of these labors we weave with the hands of experiment and description, to glimpse the greater story of their kind.\n\nIn the mind’s eye, a shell is a corridor of time, a spiral staircase that winds through the vault of the heavens. Each turn, a whorl, encircles an axis unseen, the columella, the spine of the thing. The whorls grow in their own time, marked by sutures like the rings of old trees. The greatest of these, the body whorl, stands last among its fellows. The spire is all that came before, rising to its pinnacle, the apex, and falling to its base. The creature lives within, reaching out through its door, the aperture.\n\nWe gaze upon these shells from all angles—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The common view, apertural, with the aperture facing you and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nCounting the whorls is a simple rite. Begin with the apical view, find the first suture's start. Draw a line asunder the shell, counting from this mark, quarter whorls as they go.\n\nImagine the shell as a series of doorways, traversing time and space as the creature builds its house. You may follow this path, mapping the journey of each whorl’s heart, the breadth and height of the aperture.\n\nThis path may be drawn upon paper or inscribed in the language of numbers. With these symbols, the story of the mollusk’s shell is written, and by their alteration, the tale may change.",
            "In that land stretched across the equator where the sun met the sea, the cries of newborns had not changed much in ten long years. Indonesia, with its archipelago of islands and dreams, found itself on the road to meet the world's grand visions, those Millennium goals. Yet, for the mothers and their children, the road was long and fraught with shadows. The water was cleaner, the latrines dug, but the health of the young and the bearing women lagged behind, like ships in a calm sea, missing the wind to carry them forth to the year fifteen of the new century.\n\nThe tale of healers attending births was one of numbers that shone but with a dim light. Seventy-two in a hundred births now saw a skilled hand, but many were still the hands of tradition, the midwives who could not mend what went awry. And so, the blood flowed and lives ebbed with it, the truth of numbers laid bare. The healing of the young, too, fell short as fewer children were brought to the healers when sickness struck. The records of care after birth were but whispers, incomplete and worrying, a story untold but known.\n\nIn the cities, the knife of the surgeon came to bear upon seven in a hundred mothers, but in the countryside, only two. The chasm between the town and the field was vast, like the gap between the rich man's house and the poor man's shack, where a quarter again and some more could not find a healer at all. The cost was counted in coins and lives.\n\nThe question that lingered in the air was how to mend what was broken. Should the land craft new ways, specific and clear, or should it weave a stronger cloth for all, where mothers and children found care before and after the birthing? The allure of quick fixes was strong, a temptation like the siren's call, but the wisdom of the land cautioned against it. To pour all into one cup left others dry, and healers would gather where the gold shone brightest, leaving the rest to wither. The tale of the world’s fight against the plague of AIDS was told, and the lesson of family planning left behind was learned. To run many races at once was to tire and falter, the weight of forms and ledgers heavy on the mind and hand.\n\nAnd so, the path lay open, a choice between the quick and the lasting, the easy and the just. The land would choose, as it had always done, with the wisdom of its elders and the hope of its young.",
            "In the vast sprawl of time, popular music has unfurled itself like an unending tapestry, its threads woven into so many genres that to enumerate them all is a task of futility. Such is the nature of things, for from the root of each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to name but a few—sprout myriad offshoots, each branching into its own sub and sub-sub genres, a fractal of sound and thought. Among these, heavy metal stands as a testament to the wild diversity and raw expressiveness of popular music over these past forty years. It is a genre of emotion, stark and unyielding, often dwelling in the shadowed corners of the heart. Diverse too, for the genre, almost from its inception, revealed itself pliable, a clay for the sculptor's hand, birthing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres in an ever-expanding lineage that persists to this day.\n\nAnd now, in this age, heavy metal has become a labyrinthine creature of many faces. It is a confluence of themes borrowed from other musical realms, yet it is not without origin. To comprehend the metal that pervades the airwaves now, one must gaze into the heart of the metal movement itself, understanding it as a force, a revolution rather than merely a sound.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement shaped by the darkness. It is a music of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more drama. It eschews simplicity in favor of skill; those who wield its instruments do so with masterful hands, their prowess evident in each note. Unsurprisingly, it is a movement steeped in the haze of drugs, the psychedelic tempest of the mid-seventies having driven artists to the edge of sanity, birthing records that seemed not of this world, their madness attributed to the substances that fueled them. Its qualities are dark, visceral, a stark contrast to the brighter hues of popular music that came before. Later generations of metal drew from the Romantic era's somber depths, echoing its darkness and intensity in their own creation. The lyrical darkness, as expressed by Byrne, is a cornerstone of this movement.\n\nConsider the song Helter Skelter, a glimpse into the darker psyche of the Beatles. It is a sonic rollercoaster, its undulating rhythm a nod to the chaos of drug-fueled perception. This track is oft hailed as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, a retort to the weighty, shadowy tones of a Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, in their ambition, sought to prove their mettle, planting this song like a flag upon The White Album's expansive terrain.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists laid down their dreams in paint, Henri Rousseau, a man given to his own visions, conjured dreams both in the flesh and in the mind. The Dream, a canvas birthed in 1910 by Rousseau's own hands, whispers not only of a woman transfixed amidst the wild wonders of her slumber but also of Rousseau's own aspirations. He yearned, from the first stroke of his brush, for the acknowledgment of those who tread the hallowed halls of art; for the embrace of the world he adored from afar. It was an arduous path he walked, torn between the decision to echo the masters and thus gain entry into their circle, or to wander a solitary road, painting as the muse willed, unshackled.\n\nTo understand this struggle woven into The Dream, one must peer into Rousseau's own tale. Born in the spring of 1844, in the modest town of Laval, northwestern France, he was the son of a tinsmith whose trade brought modest comfort. Rousseau's education was not in the arts, but in the mundane service of tolls and tariffs, until the age of forty, when fate's cruel hand left him bereft of his beloved Clémence and all but one of their children. It was grief that led him to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth in the pigments and the brush, a refuge from the world’s harshness. Unlike his peers, who painted the peasant with romantic eyes, Rousseau painted with the sincerity of one who knew the common lot of man.\n\nThe yearning Rousseau felt for acceptance among the art world's elite is a longing that can be understood in the scope of his life. An outsider, self-taught, entering the arena of art at an age when many are well settled into their craft, he labored alongside giants whose names echoed through the salons. It was only as the likes of Matisse began to ascend that Rousseau's own star flickered into notice. In the pages of Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of these two men, not as rivals, but as travelers on different paths. Matisse, wary of the familiar, sought to avoid the trite, while Rousseau, in his heart, wished only for a place among the accepted, to paint with such convention that he might secure his seat at the table of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the vast expanse of human thought, many a thinker has pondered the kinship between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. There lies, I reckon, a reason deep in the marrow of existence for this bond. As Keats mused in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are entwined, inseparable. Much of what we glean from life comes through the hard school of experience or the guiding hand of education. Yet, there is a curious appreciation for ethics and aesthetics that needs no such tutelage. They exist as if waiting to be discovered, not instructed. In their essence, they seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our reckonings with morality and beauty are endeavors to understand why a painting or a tale is beautiful or why an act is moral, not a ledger of rules to craft such things.\n\nIn the realm of critique, words fall short of capturing the true essence of what is good or beautiful. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance. Discussions may swirl around its composition or the mysteries it holds, but these fail to truly explain its greatness. When asked about a beloved work of art or literature, folks often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into the why of it all. Art and morals elude complete reduction to mere descriptors of their traits. As Flannery O'Connor put it, stories say what cannot be said otherwise; they speak truths beyond the reach of mere statements. No matter how we dissect a literary work, a fragment remains, transcendent and untouched. Ethics shares this ineffable quality. Wittgenstein tells us ethics cannot be expressed, for it is transcendental. This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the shared power of art and morality, binding them together in their timeless dance.\n\nFor morality and art are bound by their profound impact on us at a level that defies explanation. They speak to us in a language beyond words, touching the very core of our being. This bond is perhaps strongest in the realm of literature. As McKean observed, what sets literature apart from other arts is its moral essence. While moral standards might find no place in music or the like, they are as integral to literature as they are to life itself. To live is to navigate values, and literature resonates with us because of the values it reveals.",
            "The land now known as Germany stands as a formidable force, a realm woven with a tapestry of culture stretching from the shadowed alps of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This same spirit breathes through Köln by the Rhine, across the heartlands to the Saxon bastion of Dresden upon the Elbe. It is a land of many sources, birthed from the bones of tribes long past.  \n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, whispers its origins in the halls of scholars and the minds of historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name before it crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaul. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, spoke of the Germans as those beyond the reach of Rome, a word borrowed from the Gauls to mark the boundary of conquest. The roots of the name are tangled and uncertain, some say it spoke of spears or the noise of battle, others of neighbors in a tongue long forgotten.  \n\nTacitus, that old chronicler, wrote of these people in his ancient tome, declaring them pure and unmingled with the world beyond. He pondered who would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for the cold embrace of Germania, a land wild and unyielding, save for those whose hearts called it home.  \n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions to the edge of Germania in search of spoils, yet often returned to the heart of their empire. The Germanic tribes stood at the fringes, trading their goods and their strength, serving in the legions of Rome, a quiet presence on the edge of the world.",
            "In the shadowy world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its crooked paths through hearts and minds, a tool as potent for deception as a serpent's bite. Yet, like all masks, it wears thin, and there comes a time when a soul must shed the borrowed skin or risk becoming a ghost of its own self. To peel away such layers can leave a person stranded, adrift from those they once held dear. The heart must choose between the essence of one's being and the fragile threads of connection, for though some may shrug off the trickery, others may find their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nIn the twisted dance of gender's guise, the stakes rise higher, for it stirs the question of why one would shun their face to don another's form. Viola steps into this masquerade, a shield against the perils of a strange land: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In her guise, she finds sanctuary, yet the cost is a severance from the sisterhood of women, a solitude deepened by Olivia's love, misled by the twin faces of Viola and Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Caught in this web, Viola must wrestle with the silent longing that stirs between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn the eyes of today, Twelfth Night reveals how disguise can unearth the truths buried beneath propriety's surface, drawing out desires unspoken. Olivia and Orsino find themselves entangled in emotions that Viola's presence ignites. Does Olivia's heart beat for Cesario as a man, or does she yearn unawares for the woman beneath? The swift turn of her affections to Sebastian suggests a parody of those who judge by appearance alone, as Olivia declares the bond of kinship over passion: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the play unfolds, a mirror to the complexities of the human heart, where deception lays bare the truths we dare not speak.",
            "The tales of German colonial rule are etched deep with the ink of brutality, a specter that looms large over the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the land then known as German South West Africa. Yet to paint the expanse of a colonial empire with but a single brush would be folly. The German dominion, a mosaic of lands and peoples, bore witness to a tapestry of governance as diverse as the landscapes it encompassed. The promise and reality of education followed suit.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the remnants of German East Africa, which the world now knows as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they found among the people a surprising bloom of literacy and learning. It was a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education, which some chroniclers of the time did not hesitate to commend, not just in Tanganyika but in the distant reaches of Kamerun and beyond.\n\nYet in the lands of South West Africa, a harsher tale unfolded. Unlike their counterparts in the east, where the state's hand had shaped schools and guided the minds of the youth, here the education of the native was left to the fervor of missionary zeal, scantily aided by the government’s coffers. Indeed, the government reserved its resources for the education of Europeans, crafting schools of the state and casting a tighter rein on the mission schools that did exist. This divergence in policy left its mark long after the German banner was lowered. While other colonies could boast of learned natives, South West Africa remained largely a land of shadows, untouched by the light of education, its people unlettered and silent.\n\nThe reasons for this divergence are manifold, a knot of social, political, and economic threads. This discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and the powers that once claimed dominion over these lands. The chronicles of education in the German empire are numerous, penned mostly in the tongue of the empire itself, during or soon after its time of rule. At first, these works endeavored merely to sketch the contours of educational systems. But with time, writings in English broadened the horizon through comparative studies and deeper examinations of specific educational facets. These studies laid bare the stark differences that lay between the colonies.\n\nThe most notable work, Cohen’s study, delves into the heart of this paper’s inquiry, drawing comparisons between the systems that took root in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen argues that the settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the educational landscape of the colony.\n\nSouth West Africa, by the grace of its temperate climes and despite the desert's embrace, attracted a European populace larger than most of Germany’s other distant possessions. In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites called it home, outnumbering those in East Africa, the next closest in settler count, where just over five thousand souls lived under the German sun.",
            "The tale of two nations, the United States and Mexico, is one marked by a rivalry that spanned the years like a shadow cast long upon the land. It was a saga that stretched from the year of our Lord 1836 unto 1893, a span of fifty-seven years filled with strife and discord. The apex of this enmity was the war they called the Mexican-American War, fought between the years 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in its relentless march, did lay claim to the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, wresting them from the grasp of Mexico. Battles and skirmishes flared between these nations, a conflagration that found its peace only as the world edged toward the Great War. The roots of this contention lay deep in the soil of ideological and cultural divide, a clash of gods and traditions, a collision of material desires (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThus it is, that nations bordering one another are often locked in such rivalries, their contiguous lands breeding grounds for discord. The United States and Mexico are but one stone in the mosaic of border-bound enmities. David M. Pletcher (1977) spoke of it thus: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). While other Latin nations found a more amiable path with the United States, these two stood apart, their histories entwined with rivalry.\n\nReligious strife cast its shadow too, a specter that haunted this relationship as it has many others throughout the annals of history. Sally Frahm (2001) opined that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological battle was not one of political systems but of the very gods they worshipped, a legacy of distrust bequeathed from the English and Spanish colonial pasts, a barrier to any semblance of peace between these two great nations.\n\nIn the chronicles of Diehl and Goerts (2000), seventeen disputes are recorded in this period of rivalry. Most were territorial, born of border raids and frontier woes, the land itself a tinderbox ready to ignite. Bandits and outlaws plagued the borderlands until the day came when both nations resolved to impose their martial might upon these lawless expanses (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAnd so, the rivalry waned as Mexico found itself in thrall to the United States, dependent in ways both subtle and overt (Schmitt 1974 p. 109). As the century drew to its close, the ambitions of America shifted from the conquest of land to the dominion of economic sway over its southern neighbor (p. 110). Thus did a chapter close, not with a clash of arms but with the quiet conquest of commerce.",
            "Fifteen years past and without warning I found myself cast adrift by an ailment unknown to me, a shadow slipping silently into my life. Once, I wore the white of a nurse, my hands steady and sure, a choice born of a need as deep as the roots of an old tree, seeking the safety and certainty denied me in younger years. The refrain that echoed through my youth was this: work awaits where the sick line the halls, an endless procession of need. And so, though my heart leaned toward the path of science and the pen of a journalist, I chose the care of the infirm.\n\nYet there I stood, age forty-six, solitary and with pockets near empty, robbed of the work that had defined me. Disabled still, fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security’s meager sustenance has left me hollow, nothing of possession to claim as mine. Each dawn breaks upon a struggle anew, an unyielding test of my security and the fragile remnants of esteem. Certainty has fled my life, save for this one truth: I owe my survival not to my own strength, which falters beneath true calamity, but to the steadfast arms of kin and a few loyal companions.\n\nLife’s emergencies, vast and minute, are the only certainty, for no preparation can steel one against every storm. The nation’s reliance on the crumbling edifice of government aid has grown weary and frail, yet there lies a greater wisdom in rekindling trust among neighbors, in learning again the art of giving and receiving aid rather than each soul retreating to solitary defenses.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, the supposed backbone of this land, belies a deeper truth. Our ancestors, those who braved the great mountains in their wagons, leaned not on singular strength but on the bonds of compassion and shared sustenance. Alone, they would have perished.\n\nSo, prepare as you must. I have done so myself. A kit for disaster, the means to purify water, and the tools to seal windows against unseen threats. My shelves hold candles, matches sealed against the wet, and cans enough to stave off hunger. If you have the land and know-how, let your hands grow sustenance from the soil. But in all your preparations, do not forget the faces next door. Know your neighbors, for in their eyes lies the strength none of us possess alone.",
            "In a time long past, in the shadows of antiquity, a prince was born into the world who would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey away from the clamor of worldly desires toward a serene enlightenment, and from his teachings sprouted the roots of Buddhism, the most ancient branch of which bears the name Theravada. This faith, enduring through the passage of twenty-five centuries, has morphed as the years have worn on, its visage altered since the days when the Buddha himself walked the earth. One might see this in the land of Sri Lanka, where the people keep the water-cutting ceremony, a rite unmentioned by the Buddha yet heavy with significance for monks and laymen alike. These changes weave through the fabric of the faith, from its outward traditions to the very marrow of its doctrinal beliefs. The Theravada community, both cloistered in monastic life and in the world of the laity, has been shaped and reshaped by forces from within and without, both kind and cruel.\n\nThis tale requires understanding of certain terms that will surface again and again. Internal versus external, we say. Internal, born of those within the Buddhasasana, no matter their robes or lack thereof. External, from those who walk other paths. Hostile, those forces that wound or wish harm upon the Buddhist fold. Benign, indifferent forces, neither wishing to aid nor injure, though they may do either unbidden. These shall be the guideposts in this telling.\n\nFirst we must peer into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, to the doctrines that form its core. The Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the sacred law, contained within the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the philosophical depths. Herein lie truths like Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering that clings to life; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Through these truths, one may break the chains of Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara shattered, desire, hatred, and delusion shall also fade, and enlightenment may be grasped. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law for living: for the layman, five precepts to guide the soul; for the monk, a myriad more. But at the very heart lies the four noble truths. First, that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is its cause. Third, that the chains of suffering can be broken."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men speak of agreements and the nature of things unseen, culture casts its long shadow. It is a specter defined as much by its absence as by its presence, by the echoes it leaves in the soul and the weight it bears on the tongue. Culture is no monolith, no singular entity, but a multitudinous sea. To say that all Russians are steadfast as the northern winds or that all Japanese move with the yielding grace of willow branches is to paint the world in the colors of folly. These broad strokes miss the contours that matter, the subtle plays of light and dark that shape the terrain of negotiation. To step into the world of another is to see through the veil of one's own making, where the familiar dances with the foreign, and understanding is a bridge built from the stones of comparison.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another's culture is a journey through time and trial, a path that winds through the pages of history and the shadows of prejudice. It is not for the judge to pass sentence nor the reformer to remake, but for the traveler to accept the world as it is, to navigate its currents with care. Especially when the winds are against you, when the ground beneath your feet is strange, respect is the compass that will lead you past the reefs of misunderstanding and toward the open sea of accord.\n\nYet let it be known that culture knows no bounds of nation alone. Within the walls of commerce, cultures rise and fall like the tides. A company may build its house on the sands of long hours or the shores of leisure. It is in the cut of a suit, the cadence of a voice, the delegation of power, that one sees the hand of culture at work. Philanthropy may be a river flowing freely or a spring tapped by command. Look closely at the fabric of American enterprise, stitched with threads of diversity and variance, and see the quilt of thought that lies beneath. Even where the surface seems smooth, the depths promise complexity.\n\nValues are the compass rose by which the currents of culture are charted. They tell the why of a thing. Should a culture hold dear the sanctity of face or the balm of harmony, know that no man will disgrace his kin or master for the sake of gain. Where the bargain is king, the game is played to the last breath. These truths must be known before words are spoken, before hands are clasped across the table. Yet the wise negotiator sees beyond the mask of culture, seeks the man behind the role, for it is there that the true language of negotiation is learned.",

Such is the lamentation of Psalm 14, a refrain echoed in the musings of St. Anselm as he ponders the ethereal nature of a God unseen yet ever-present. Here too stands Thomas Aquinas, shadowed by the same inquiry, and thus we are cast into the task of discerning the superior testament to the divine. Yet for brevity's sake, we must assume a common ground in their belief—a God shaped by the scriptures of old, the God of the Bible. To entertain an abstraction beyond their shared vision would undermine the very essence of their defense, for they argue not for gods many but for one.\n\nAnd so we delve into Anselm's meditation, a journey inward, faith as the lantern by which he navigates the dark corridors of the soul. It is within this inner sanctum that he claims the presence of God is known, a truth not external but intrinsic, woven into the fabric of our understanding. His words twist and turn, a labyrinth of thought, yet the heart of it is this: God's existence anchored in the mind’s eye, self-evident and unassailable.\n\nContrast this with Aquinas, who stands upon the firm ground of reason, eschewing the ethereal for the tangible. His is a God proven by the world’s own mechanics, a deity revealed through the lens of empirical scrutiny. To him, faith is but a crutch unnecessary, for his God is found in the logic of motion and cause, in the necessity of existence and order. Five paths he lays before us, each a testament to the rational soul, each a puzzle piece fitting in the grand design that speaks to the divine presence.\n\nIn the end, neither argument holds the whole truth, for each is but a facet of the same jewel, reflecting the light of understanding in different hues. Yet through their words, we glimpse the eternal, a whisper of the divine that stirs the heart and challenges the mind.",
            "In the craft of writing, authors wield various tools to evoke a certain sentiment or posture toward matters of consequence. Among these tools, some prove more potent than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, such techniques abound, woven into the very fabric of the narrative. Fitzgerald, with a meticulous hand, pairs adjectives and nouns in uncommon unions, casting a particular aura upon his subjects. At times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, employing it with deliberate intent. Within the pages of his novel, Fitzgerald imbues colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink with profound significance. Through The Great Gatsby, he constructs a language of colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, to evoke a memory of a feeling tied to something of import.\n\nWhite and gray, in Fitzgerald's palette, speak of sameness, with white bearing the sheen of elegance and gray the weight of age and wear. He lays the groundwork for this meaning early on, with persistent refrains of both. Daisy and Jordan are portrayed perpetually \"in white\"—a recurring motif. Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" in Myrtle's presence, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" It is only when Nick perceives the spectacle of Gatsby's festivity that the hues shift to \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald delineates these shades further, painting mundanity in their tones: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the attendees of Gatsby's soirées become \"gray names\" in Nick's ledger, and Catherine’s abode is but \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—the embodiment of uniformity. Common folk and places are cast in white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is strewn with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" a child at the railway is \"gray,\" as is the dog-seller, \"a gray old man.\"\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has suffused white/gray with enough meaning, he wields them to signify insignificance or conformity. This symbology first takes root with Daisy. After an extended absence of these tones, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" transforming her into less a person and more a piece of the uniform landscape, an object of Gatsby's yearning. This technique envelops Daisy, underscoring her role as a mere part of the tapestry: a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,\" and once more, she is clad in \"white\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the land rolls gentle and the air is warm, the earth yields its bounty with a quiet abundance. The fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens that sway in the soft breeze, the squat forms of squash and broccoli, herbs and the hanging fruits of trees—peaches, lemons—that glimmer like small suns. In that place, the berries grow sweet and honey is gathered, peppers burn their red and green into the soil, and the people there have a hunger for the organic, for the earth's pure gift untarnished by man's hand. Long waiting lists stretch out for the promise of such bounty, and eggs and milk untouched by the ordinary means of production find their way to eager mouths. The land itself opens its arms to those who seek more than sustenance, offering paths for the wandering foot, the watching of birds, the simple pleasure of being amid the living world.\n\nThis is the way of things, a land where the owner might find themselves with the benefits accorded by the government for tending their earth with care, improving the wild spaces, offering the curious a glimpse into the workings of their farm, and perhaps in doing so, finding a way to sustain both themselves and the land they hold dear. The organic way is not without its burdens. It demands the sweat of labor, the vigilance against pest and weed, the nurturing of the soil without the crutch of chemical aid. The losses are keenly felt, for the scale of such endeavor is small, the hands few. Yet in this, there is the promise of life more diverse, the land teeming with what might otherwise be lost to the sterility of the conventional.\n\nThere is a place in this tale, a parcel set against the town of Potrero, lying in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. A span of 160 acres where chaparral and the nonnative grasses of the Mediterranean meet the oak woodland that stands sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. It is a realm within the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its net over many a creature and plant. Over a hundred of them, some teetering on the brink of oblivion—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, those fragile wings of certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher among them. Others are slipping from us, like the burrowing owls whose homes are threatened.\n\nThe land bears the marks of those who came before, the Native Americans who walked its soil for untold ages, and later the ranchers and sellers of cordwood who laid their claim in the 1800s. This land was once a homestead, a place for grazing and the harvesting of wood through the passage of years. Here I chose to lay my gaze upon a property, drawn from the pages of real estate, to seek out the paths a small farmer might tread, searching for the aid that government might offer to ease their burden and preserve the wild that their toil tends to. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model for what might be wrought from this land by hands willing to dream and to labor.",
            "In the dusky quiet of the world, there exists a bond between brothers that time nor tempest can sunder. It's a tether woven with threads of love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, each strand a testament to their shared blood and shared fate. Brothers know each other in ways that no one else can fathom, for in the eyes of one lies the reflection of the other, a strange mirror of the soul. And it is in the darkest hours, when the world seems to tilt towards oblivion, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be stained with virtue or vice. These emotions, when unfurled, demand their due, and the understanding of such demands is to reckon with their price. For when a man looks into the eyes of his brother and sees there his own visage, he sees not the mask the world perceives but the essence of his being. In the deeds he commits, and the shadows those deeds cast, his true nature is revealed. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this perilous path, their hearts a battleground of emotions fierce and wild. Through a land resplendent in its verdancy, they embark upon a journey doomed from the start. Disappointment, bitter as gall, meets pride, fierce as flame, in the story's dreadful climax, and only one brother emerges from the darkness. The theme winds its way through the characters of the brothers, through the eyes of Doodle and the narrator, who bears witness to the storm within his heart and the world outside, each shaping his steps and the path he treads.\n\nThe heart of the protagonist, it beats with pride—a pride that spurs him from the first steps he takes beside his fragile brother, Doodle, to the last fateful venture they share. Resentment shadows his love, for he yearned for a brother who could match his stride, who could learn the secrets of breath held, of feet flying over earth, of limbs reaching for the sky among the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to rest in the arms of the ancient pine by the barn. But Doodle, frail Doodle, was a child marked by fate, his heart a delicate thing, surviving against all odds. The dreams of the young protagonist shattered like glass, his fantasies dashed upon the rocks of reality. Anger crept in, dark and insidious, leading him to thoughts of ending the tiny life that had so betrayed his hopes. What boy contemplates such darkness? Yet the shadow lifts when the child smiles, a simple gesture that speaks of light and possibility. In that smile, the protagonist finds a flicker of hope, an awakening of the love that lay dormant beneath his pride. His resolve, it seems, was but a shadow in the presence of his brother's light.",
            "In the vast and shadowed labyrinth that is the human mind, one finds a tangle of complexities and creations, an engine of thought and wonder. As the world spun forward from the firelit caves to the towers of glass, the image of the mind shifted with it. Once likened to a tablet of wax, then a parchment, then a tome, and now a machine of wires and circuits. Yet in all these likenesses lies a folly, for in their simplicity they veil the truth of the mind's mystery.\n\nThe senses are the gates through which the world enters, each a whisper of the earth turned into signals of light and sound and touch, electric and chemical. The mind, in its silent depths, takes these murmurs, weaving them into shapes and meanings, a dance of bottom and top, rising and falling like the tides. Consider the sight of a dark box upon a pale expanse, the eye gathering the hues and lines, the brain discerning the box from the nothingness, a dark shape against the light. Yet the mind, knowing more than it sees, tells you this is no mere void but a thing of substance, a box and not a hole.\n\nAnd as the world floods in, there stands a sentinel of attention, choosing which echoes to heed, which to let pass into the depths. It spares you the blades of grass beneath your feet, yet in the clamor of voices, it plucks your name from the air. In this filtering, the mind’s work is never done, ever sifting, ever weaving.\n\nTo hold what is known, the mind must bind it in memory, each a thread in the tapestry of thought. There are memories that flicker and fade, others that linger long. They are encoded, each sense its own tongue, be it the shape of a word upon the page, the sound it echoes, or the meaning it holds. Once bound, they must endure. In fleeting memory, perhaps it is a spark that leaps the gap between cells. In the deeper wells of memory, it may be the very frame of life itself, a structure of proteins holding fast.\n\nThe knowing of things, how they sit within the mind, has been drawn in many maps. Some speak of webs of meaning, nodes of thought connected by threads unseen, like stars in a constellation. Thus a chair might find itself beside a table, and both might touch upon the notion of wood, each a stepping stone upon the river of thought. \n\nIn all this, the mind stands a testament to the unfathomable, a testament to what it means to see and to know.",
            "In the year 2007, the land of America found itself ensnared in a relentless financial maelstrom. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the once steadfast bastions of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations of the nation lay broken and desolate. This recession lingers still, and so we are compelled to ponder the origins of this calamity and seek a path to forestall its recurrence. The crisis, born of avarice and naïveté in the halls of power, saw banks and firms driven to dispense sub-prime loans upon a financial edifice ill-equipped to bear such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the yoke of pressure, took to underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When the weight of default bore down upon the borrowers, the banks, bereft of capital reserve, unleashed chaos upon the repackaged mortgages they had sown, casting the economy into turmoil.\n\nThe seeds of this financial debacle were sown in the soil of 1999, during the reign of Clinton, a president with eyes set on a second term. He sought favor with the populace, and so his administration loosened the reins on lending, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow. A voice from that time, Steven Holmes of the New York Times, spoke of Fannie Mae, the nation's titan of home mortgages, bending under the weight of the administration's demands to expand loans to those of modest means, while the specter of shareholder profit hung heavy. Holmes foresaw the reckoning, a government-subsidized behemoth teetering on the edge of ruin in an economic downturn, reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. As foretold, indiscriminate lending would herald the downfall of the economy.\n\nThe confluence of many forces plunged the economy into chaos. The architecture of mortgages transformed into something new and inscrutable. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations intertwined the fates of multiple sectors with the housing market, leaving households and financial markets precariously leveraged, vulnerable to even the slightest shift in price.\n\nThe bubble, bloated and fragile, burst at last, and those financial titans who had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five great investment banks of the nation bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, a burden that equaled near a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced into the embrace of commercial banking with its strictures and constraints. Fannie and Freddie, crushed under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, fell into the hands of the government in the autumn of 2008.",
            "In the quiet spaces of a tale, where the words stretch out like the land at dusk, there lies exposition. A place where the writer, if unguarded, may soar high on wings of prose only to find the ground rising up to meet them too soon. It is a place where readers might find their eyes growing heavy, their fingers restless upon the page, or the cursor hovering over that \"Back\" button with a curse muttered low. Even Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has been known to hurl admonitions at the screen when confronted with a deluge of superfluous detail.\n\nExposition is a treacherous companion.\n\nThose who read with care have long grasped the tenet, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin is ensnared by the siren call of unwelcome verbosity, where nothing stirs, or worse, where too much is said. It is the whisperer perched upon the shoulder, urging the writer to unburden themselves of history, to clear the path for the tale's heart (not to be confused with its twin, urging every fragment of a character’s past be laid bare).\n\nTo tell is to lead the audience through the annals of what has been, in prose stripped bare to its bones. In the cinema, it is the moment when one character unspools a yarn of consequence to another, much like a mariner ancient and weary of his tale. In the pages of fiction, it is the author who whispers these truths.\n\nImagine a story unfolds, and in it, the heroine meets her love in a time and place long past. They wed in grand fashion, and before her very eyes, he is taken from this world. Would you not expect these moments to stretch beyond mere pages, to breathe life into their dialogue, to let the husband’s nature unfurl, to speak through word and deed the depth of his love? Would you not expect the heroine to reveal through action and thought how her life was reshaped by his presence, how he was the sun to her days? If the story insists upon such truths, would you not wish to feel the weight of his absence, to join her in that mourning, to find yourself bound to her journey?\n\nThus, the tale must bear flesh upon its bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of words, it falls to you to clothe the narrative in life. (*glances at the metaphor, breathes deep, and continues*) There is a lure to hasten through the tale’s weave. Perhaps a character steps forth, and you know his past: once he flew with the Air Force, now he keeps vigil over a gas station in the night, twice wed with no progeny, a man who finds solace in fishing, dreams in secret of owning that station, and began his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the screen and watched the tales unfold from the heart of Columbus, Ohio. The first flicker of life came through NBC 4's broadcast that morning in the heat of August, the year being 2011. It began with a man from Ashley, Ohio. A wicked tale of a husband named Shad Hostettler who had taken a knife to his wife, her name yet a mystery to the world. They put his face up for all to see, a visage stained with malice, and yet they lingered but a moment, two minutes of news time, for the story was still fresh and bleeding.\n\nNext came the account of a young man, Travis Buyers, just eighteen years of age. He had been felled by gunfire in the early hours, Sharon Woods the place, and his life hung in precarious balance. The culprits were shadows, unknown, and the SWAT Team waded into the mire of investigation. This tale too was brief, perhaps because Travis was a black youth, and such stories often slip by unnoticed. I have seen it, the way the media drums a furious beat for the white child or the missing white soul, while the plight of minorities whispers by like a breeze scarcely felt.\n\nThen there was the report of a bullet hole, a .22 caliber remnant lodged in the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. They surmised where the shot had come to pass, and Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand-dollar promise for the one who could lead them to the shooter.\n\nThe weather came next, rain and storm clouds hovering on the afternoon horizon for Saturday. Temperatures promised to cling to the low eighties, a bait to keep the watchers hooked to the unfolding narrative.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, a Clime Road UDF in Columbus had been struck by a man cloaked in a hoodie, skin as dark as the night that hid him. They spent words upon his complexion, his height, his weight, as though these things alone mattered.\n\nLastly, they spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a convict from the sprawling plains of Texas. He had woven a web of marijuana from Texas to Ohio, a kingpin they called him. Twenty-five years they sentenced him, though they chose to say \"300 months,\" a curious choice of words, perhaps to twist the knife of time deeper. They noted his Hispanic roots, a detail that seemed to float in the air without tether to the tale they wove.",
            "An exchange traded fund, known to those who wander the financial plains as an ETF, is a creature born of the market, designed to mirror the movements of indices and commodities, or a basket of assets like the index fund itself, yet it moves with a freedom uncommon, trading as a stock might upon the exchange. It offers the manner of diversification known to an index fund, yet carries the perks of holding a single stock, such as the short sale, the margin purchase, and the acquisition of but a solitary share. These lures are indeed potent, yet the expense ratios of ETFs remain low, beneath those of the average mutual fund. But in the shadows lie the costs, the commissions on any trade, much like those that accompany a stock order. The variety of funds is vast and varied, and though these benefits are laid bare, the wise investor must always question if the promise of diversification rings true and to what degree. Here, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the top ten holdings that form its essence, to see if the virtues of a singular ETF might rival those of a portfolio crafted from the ten stocks themselves, and whether a more cunning arrangement of these stocks might yield a sharper ratio or greater return.\n\nTo judge the ETF, we shall not burden ourselves with every holding within, but focus on the foremost ten, which claim 63.58 percent of the assets. Below are these ten, with their share of the whole.\n\nTo seek how well these ten stocks embody the ETF IHF entire, we take their present percentage of assets, normalize it to a full hundred, and from there calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely these ten stocks, in the measure the ETF hath decreed through its holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain that a portfolio of merely these ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent greater than the ETF itself, a 16 percent elevation in gains. The Beta of these ten is also .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. Thus far, it seems that a portfolio of only the top ten might offer a higher return with a lesser beta. Yet, there lurks the chance that the means of these two portfolios are not so different as they might seem.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different, we must measure the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, and normalize them to a full hundred, to weigh their total standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the turning pages of time, as one stares back upon Figure 17, there comes a fall, sudden and steep, of the commuter log submissions in the third moon of the project. It was a thing that weighed heavy on the heart, the reason for which lay shrouded in the mysteries of human behavior and the cold grasp of winter upon a New England campus. The world turns somber, and the wheels of bicycles cease their turning, footsteps falter upon the frostbitten earth. December, a harbinger of semester's end, finds souls burdened with the reckoning of academic toil, the tallying of grades, and the ceaseless march toward holiday respite. In such a time, the task of recording one's passage to and fro may well have slipped beneath the currents of consciousness.\n\nThe season of festivity and flight from the halls of learning gives rise to a month-long void, a time when scholars and teachers alike find no cause to cross the threshold of the institution. The spring comes not until late January, a fact that casts its own shadow upon the number of logs that might be expected. Yet February's emptiness stands unexplained, a puzzle to confound the senses. It could be said that any endeavor born of spirit and vigor waxes strongest at the outset, only to wane as the days grow dark. In the face of such decline, we birthed the Carpool Challenge Week, a clarion call in March to stir the embers of enthusiasm, and indeed, the numbers rose anew.\n\nThe road we walked was fraught with the challenge of sustaining the flame against both the ebbing tide of interest and the peculiar rhythms of academic life. Another trial came in the form of man's affinity for the automobile, a love affair with liberty and solitude that runs deep in the veins of the land. To turn hearts toward other paths, one must offer enticements, tokens of worth. We dispensed prizes, tokens of appreciation from the local merchants of food and drink, the healers of muscle, the keepers of books, and even the great emporiums of the nation. There lingered a question, a thought unspoken—what might have been the effect of grander rewards, a fine bicycle or a car of hybrid or electric kind, to stave off the decline? The prizes, immutable through the journey, might have grown in stature as the months passed, a beacon to draw the wandering eyes. Gift cards sufficed in the beginning, but what if, come December, the promise of bicycles had been whispered, and by January, the allure of a motor car? One can only wonder if the tide might have turned, if the engagement might have risen like the sun after a long, dark night.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I found myself drawn to the flickering ghosts of early Edison films, those trick films that danced between the years of 1895 and 1901. Fifteen in all, each a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the alchemy of creative editing. My journey through these spectral reels was not merely one of observation, but a study of their poetics, tracing the arc of their evolution and the rare deviations that emerged in the latter days of this period. \n\nThese films stand as relics of a bygone era, bound to the stage and its ancient customs. Their frames are locked within a frontal proscenium, the camera a steadfast sentinel, unmoving, capturing long and medium shots with a steadfast adherence to the principle that one shot equals one film. Yet, as the century turned, a few dared to breach these confines, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nThe essence of these trick films lies in their setting, the interior stage framed by the proscenium's rigid boundaries. The camera remains as still as a forgotten sentinel, bearing witness to the actors' movements confined to the horizontal plane. They do not venture forth towards the lens, nor recede into the background. Such is the nature of Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors traverse the stage laterally, vanishing from sight without the camera's pursuit.\n\nThis proscenium's grip dictates the distance from which we view these performances, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium ones. Never do we find the intimacy of a close-up, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville dictates that the audience must behold the entirety of the spectacle, framed within the stage's embrace. The actors remain in the middle ground, distant from the camera’s gaze, close-ups forever elusive.\n\nIn their simplicity, these early trick films adhere to a singular vision: one conceptual shot defines an entire film. Their brevity, often confined to a minute or less, is a reflection of this constraint, shaped by the mechanical limits of frames per second. Their narratives are mere whispers, a nod to the vaudevillian roots from which they sprang, their magic and sleight of hand captured in fleeting acts. Yet, within this singular vision lies a deception. A trick film's sole shot is often a composite, multiple exposures woven together to conjure the illusion of disappearance or transformation. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early example where a keen eye discerns the seam where Mary’s severed “head” enters the frame, though to the unsuspecting eye it remains a seamless tale told in one breath.",
            "There is a certain irony in the Gothic novel, a paradox of 'Old-New,' as Ian Watt would have it, a curious dance of contradiction that finds its roots in the pages of The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic mode, oftentimes dismissed and at other moments lauded for its 'terrible sublime' nature, finds itself both shallow and profound (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto stands as the progenitor of this curious genre, crafting from the bones of ancient and modern romances a new form of literary expression. Walpole weaves the old with the new—theatrical flourishes of yore with the mimetic whispers of nature found in modern tales—to birth what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic draws from the well of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition—a tapestry of the past in the face of a world racing towards modernity. Even when The Castle of Otranto first saw the light of day, the term \"gothic\" bore the weight of many epochs and styles, a relic deemed unsophisticated against the tide of modern advancement. Yet it is this marriage of theatrical Gothic and novelistic intimacy, this journey into the psyche of its characters, that grants the Gothic its timeless resonance, lingering as both relic and revelation to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nWithin the Gothic's shadowed corridors lies the concept of chivalry, a vestige of the medieval knightly ideal, retained and reshaped in the original Gothic tale, The Castle of Otranto. For the Gothic scribe, chivalry stood as emblematic of a bygone valor and honor, a mirror held to a society perceived as lacking. Through the chivalric lens, the 'gothic past' becomes a romanticized ideal, hinting at the dawn of Romanticism, striving to elevate the present. Walpole, encircled by political strife and the shadows of unjust censure, perhaps saw in the Gothic era a moral compass, a goodness lost to his contemporary world. In his narrative, this theme finds embodiment in the character of Frederic, a figure whose chivalric virtues are heralded before his presence graces the page.\n\nFrederic, a prince draped in traditional chivalric imagery, bears the marks of suffering and the scars of tragedy, a man thought slain by infidels. The gallant and courteous Knight emerges, exaggerated to the point of Gothic excess, a harbinger of the tropes yet to come (66).",
            "In the quiet hours before dawn, as the world lay in the muted embrace of night’s departing shadow, the ceaseless machinery of commerce stirred to life. Supply chain management, the unheralded orchestrator of goods from their nascent inception to their final destination in the hands of the waiting customer, unfolds its complex symphony of movement and time. It was Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown, who in the year of 1982 sought to give this grand endeavor a name. And thus, supply chain management was christened, a term to encapsulate the intricate dance of planning and execution, a means to quench the ever-thirsting needs of a world spinning ever faster.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce, the managers, wield these elements like seasoned hands at the loom, weaving the fabric of satisfaction for those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first among equals, stands as the bedrock. It is here that the seeds of all that follows are sown. It is a place where questions of when, why, where, and how are answered, where the whims of the market are deciphered like ancient runes to unveil the desires of those who wait beyond. Once the market’s voice has been heard and understood, the managers set about the task of deciding what to create, how much to create, and where these creations shall spring forth. It is a delicate balance, a dance of numbers and instinct, for to misstep here is to invite ruin. \n\nThe chosen site of production becomes a crucible where schedules are forged and machinery hums with purpose. Every cog, every detail holds weight, for the margin of error is thin, and the cost of miscalculation looms large, a specter of squandered time and treasure. I have seen this with my own eyes, in the cavernous aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where the very air seemed to hum with the precision of well-oiled processes. There, even the uniforms bore the imprint of meticulous design, a testament to the power of order amidst the chaos.\n\nSupply follows closely, a river of decisions that shape the capabilities of the facility, a testament to strategic foresight. Here lies the question of divisions, each with its own machinery, its own cadre of workers, and its own unique expertise. The manager, like a conductor before an orchestra, must decide which division shall take up the baton, or if the work shall find its way to other hands, other lands. This too is a choice fraught with consequence, for the aim is velocity—the alchemy of achieving quality and flexibility while keeping the relentless beast of cost at bay.\n\nThus, the great wheel turns, an endless cycle of creation and movement, a testament to human ingenuity and the ceaseless march of progress.",
            "Victorian novels, with their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy's pomp and circumstance, often seem to linger in a world far removed from the common man's woes. But there are tales that stray from this well-trodden path, tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that breathe a different kind of air. They are works cloaked in mystery and tinged with the strange, stepping away from the expected to deepen the souls of their characters, revealing the shadowed motives and tumultuous emotions that lie within.\n\nThere is a passage where young Oliver finds himself adrift in a sea of confusion. The memory of Sikes and Crackit, their arguments echoing like ghosts in his mind, and the sudden crack of gunfire that sent cries into the night. Light and chaos envelop him as unseen forces whisk him away, each vision imbued with an unyielding sense of torment that gnaws at him relentlessly.\n\nIn these novels, mystery often unfolds through dreams or dreamlike states, each serving its unique purpose. In Oliver Twist, these eerie episodes peel back the layers of Oliver's soul, exposing his pains and his dim awareness of the swirling forces around him. When the shooting incident is revisited, it's as if Oliver is caught in a fever dream, reliving the terror as he seeks aid. The passage underscores his helplessness, the events slipping through his fingers like dust, his health teetering on the brink, visions of Sikes and Crackit haunting him. The gunfire overwhelms him, his senses dulled, the unseen hand of fate carrying him away. Pain becomes a constant companion, no longer a shock but a steady drip of fear. In this overwhelming tide, the question of whose hand guides his fate rises like smoke. Certainly not his own, for Oliver seems adrift in a world he cannot command, his spirit worn down by Fagin's creeping influence. A sense of resignation seeps into him, a silent acceptance of despair, numbing his will to act, even in the face of death.\n\nTime slips by in a haze, the day swallowed by night, a night both endless in its silence and fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "Some years past, I found myself in the company of young minds, tending to their struggles in that after school sanctuary. My task was simple, yet profound, to guide them through the labyrinth of their studies, though English and the written word were where my own strengths lay. It was then that I was enlisted by one of the teachers to aid a young lad named Adrian. He could have been third or fourth grade, but what troubled him was the written script, letters that danced away from his understanding. It struck me, peculiar as it was, that some letters he grasped with ease while others eluded him entirely, a mystery not easily unraveled. He was of Latino descent, this I knew, yet his English was as flawless as the sky is wide. Our journey was arduous until the day his mother stepped into the room, her tongue solely Spanish, mine barely passable. But in the exchange that followed, the truth fell upon me like an unyielding weight. It was not the words Adrian struggled with, but a simple lack of familiarity with the English alphabet. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him, I cannot say, but I hold hope that his path has since brightened.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light upon the silent barricades of language in our schools, a truth vivid in the sunlit expanse of California. It serves to remind us that the barriers are not always as they seem. A child may command the spoken English with the ease of a breeze, yet the written form can stand as an insurmountable wall. We can all agree upon the existence of this struggle, but the question remains: what is to be done? For Adrian, the remedy was simple, though not simplistic, teaching him the alphabet, the sounds. Yet for those who scarcely speak the language at all, the solution grows tangled and complex. There is no singular answer. The path lies not in one approach but in the weaving of many: dual language programs, immersion in the mainstream, the guidance of private tutors, the structure of ESL classes.\n\nTo begin with, the dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child but for every child. Studies have revealed that those in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this notion, whispering of wasted resources, of no gain for the majority, but such fears are unfounded. Should these programs become the norm rather than the outlier, all children would glean their benefits. Yet the question persists: how to implement this? To demand bilingualism of all teachers is to court the unattainable. But there lies in possibility the employment of aids, tutors, call them what you will, who can bridge the gap with their bilingual tongues.",
            "From the time we are children, the tales are spun of a world beyond us, vast and incomprehensible. Some are led to the pews of Sunday school, others to the quiet refuge of a temple, while still others wander within their own souls for the truths they seek. Many take on the mantle of faith handed down through generations, while others cast it aside, denying any realm beyond their own narrow sphere of existence. We may adopt a creed only to discard it for another as the years roll on. Whatever path we choose, we strive to shape our identity through the prism of our own spiritual insights. We search for a light in the dark to lead us from shadows to the sun.\n\nA cardinal, my father once told me when I asked his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above as we shared our cigarettes. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants that clung to the edge. He peered into the rain, a gaze that spoke of searching, of remembering. He had grown gaunt, his clothes hung loose, his hair thinned. Still he looked out, avoiding my eyes. I was alone, frightened, unable to voice the depth of my impending loss, for to speak it would make it real for us both. I embraced him, settled back in my chair, and inched closer to him as we watched the rain fall through the dim light of June's end.\n\nHe passed in December, five days after I'd turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation did little but extend his suffering beyond the doctor's predictions; what worth lay in that, when it served only to prolong his pain, was beyond me. What kind of God does this, I wondered in the silence. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased listening long ago.\n\nI did not wish to watch him cross from this life to the next. So I did not. I could not bear witness to the end of the force that had given me life. I chose to remember him in his living, not his dying. Besides, I knew him better than most, better even than his kin, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him leave this world. For three days I lay curdled on my bed, awaiting the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "In the dust and the dirt of Caroline, there was a man named John Taylor who held the banner of Republicanism like a torch against the night. A farmer by trade, his hands knew the soil and his heart knew the politics that sprouted from it. He was a voice that spoke of freedom, a voice unyielding in its clamor against the shadow of governance. His heart beat for the land, for the agrarian life which he held as the highest calling, a life that shaped his notions of sovereignty, of Constitutions, and the courts that would pass judgment.\n\nTaylor saw the land of the United States as a blank canvas, unblemished by the weight of old traditions, ripe for the birth of a new order of self-rule. He held firm to the belief in the natural rights of man, a fragile web where the breaking of one strand could unravel the whole. These rights, he said, were sacred, not to be touched by the hands of government. In the wilds of nature, he claimed, strength and cunning ruled, but in civilization, a different order must prevail.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor spoke of a government that knew the dual nature of man's heart, both the light and the dark. He was a man who saw the world in stark contrasts. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he would say, his words heavy with the weight of truth. He called for principles that safeguarded the land, that nurtured the earth, and kept the greedy hand of capitalism at bay. A government of such principles, he believed, would run true no matter the hands that guided it, for the hands of men were ever drawn by self-interest. Yet, this self-interest could be a force for good, so long as it served the common weal and did not give rise to lesser tribes that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant eye must watch over the government, lest it stray into the mire of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, was a man of strict sense when it came to the Constitution. He wished for a Federal government as limited as the words on the parchment allowed. He feared the bloat of a great Federal beast, for it would grow tyrannical, and tyranny was expensive. Yet, he knew too well the danger of reading the document without the light of its creators' intent. Even more, he looked to the Declaration of Independence as the true covenant, speaking not of one nation but of many, each a sovereign entity in its own right.",
            "I stood and gazed downwards, the emptiness of thought echoing the view before me. My mind, detached yet aware, dissected the scene with a precision that refused to bind it to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted through my awareness and vanished, as if my consciousness itself were but a river carrying images away. It was as though I had no thoughts of my own, merely the fluid experience of observation.\n\nOnce upon a time, an artist I knew suggested a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil’s nature to the mind’s interpretation of lines. It spoke of framing a picture, a square reducing the complexity of a scene—say, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that led to a dining room—into a manageable vision, the fruit isolated on its simple plane.\n\nBut as I stared at the bowl before me, I found no artist’s frame to contain it. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand there in silent wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his love of greenery, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance embraced a spectrum of colors. If I were to claim my own artistic vision, then here lay the genesis of my creation, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found their way to the chosen tool of my artistry, muscles tensing and releasing as my hand moved, the will of my mind manifesting in what could have been the pinnacle of creativity. The water swirled, placid and clear. Fragments of matter broke away, vanishing into nothingness. With a quickening pulse, my hand struck the handle once more. Still, the obstinate brown mass clung to the bowl’s base like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a shoulder’s width apart, and a green tie cinching my neck uncomfortably, I frowned at the insolent heap of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. More flushes, more moments of solitary reflection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it wore a padded glove. Straightening, then bending, my hand sank slowly into the water, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "In the twilight of youth, where the world unfurls vast and uncharted, the young find themselves behind the wheel, teetering on the brink of destiny, and the road claims them. It is a confluence of misfortune, where the sinews of inexperience tighten their grip, and the fledgling minds of teenagers falter amidst the perilous landscape of asphalt and speed. The National Institutes of Health speak to the unfinished architecture of the adolescent brain, unfit to bear the weight of the road's hazards. Simple inexperience, a silent specter, lies at the heart of this grim equation. It not only augments the tally of the dead but also ushers forth a litany of rollovers, reckless speeds, and wayward journeys off the intended path.\n\nIn the company of their peers, these young souls often fare worse, for such is the folly of youth to congregate and dare the fates. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted these waters and found a harrowing correlation between the age of those who ride alongside and the frequency of calamity that ensues.\n\nIn the sunlit expanses of California and beyond, measures have been set in motion to tether the wildness of young drivers, provisional licenses that seek to curtail their nocturnal wanderings and limit the companionship of fellow minors. Yet, these measures are but feeble barriers against the tide. The truth lies bare, that the youngest among us, by all accounts, are ill-prepared to shoulder the burdens of risk and responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, a voice of caution, contends that even at eighteen the mantle is too great. His research, echoed in the pages of USA Today, reveals a predilection for risk, the allure of thrill that grips those not yet nineteen or twenty. It stands to reason that the granting of the wheel should be delayed until the tempest within has calmed.\n\nShould we persist in bestowing driver’s licenses upon the young, the roads will continue to run red with tragedy, the toll climbing ever higher. By the dawn of 2010, the progeny of the Baby-Boomers will come of age, a legion of new drivers poised to take to the highways.\n\nLegislation, clear in its intent, could forge a path forward. Schools might continue to impart the rudiments of driving, laying the groundwork for the journey ahead, yet none beneath the age of eighteen would command the power of a vehicle. A provisional permit could yet be offered, a precursor to full licensure, with requisite hours of practice, echoing the standards of states like California, with its mandate of six hours behind the wheel and fifty in the company of an adult. The statistics of death and ruin span the breadth of this land, and thus a national decree would be a prudent, perhaps necessary, shield for the youth of this nation.\n\nThis proposal, while not novel, is a call to reason, a beacon to guide us from the shadows.",
            "This manuscript delves into the depths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known in the annals as CAPD. It begins with a fleeting definition, like a whisper upon the wind, before moving to the diagnostic journey, studded with the signs and signals that warn of its presence. And in its final chapters, it offers the teacher in a mainstream classroom the tools to aid those students who bear this unseen burden.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, walks a fine line in the realm of auditory perception. It speaks of the central nervous system's dance with auditory information, the way it wields sound like a craftsman with his tools. Defined with precision, CAP stands as the sentinel of perception within the central nervous system. It concerns itself with the neurobiologic symphony that underpins processing, bringing forth the auditory potentials that hum beneath the surface (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). It is a disorder not of hearing, but of translating the world's sounds, where the brain's orchestra fails to play its part, leaving voices entangled with the clamor of the world.\n\nThe echoes of CAPD reach back to a time in the mid-twentieth century, when it bore the name \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In the dusty corridors of research, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari carved out tests for the afflicted children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, laying bare the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System, a model to grasp the unseen workings of perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The winds of change came in 1977, when a national conference ignited the flame of research into the hearts of children with CAPD.\n\nThe disorder manifests with a myriad of faces: the sufferer may wander lost in the tapestry of sound, unable to anchor their senses; they may struggle to discern between the myriad acoustic events that ripple through their consciousness; the patterns of sound may elude them; the subtle shifts in speech, like the sharp edge of sarcasm hidden in a voice, may pass unnoticed; the cacophony of the world may drown each successive sound; the clues that sound offers may wither, leaving no trace for the mind to follow; the sequence of sound may unravel, leaving them adrift upon the sea of auditory chaos (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD calls for an observant eye, a systematic scrutiny of listening behavior and auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others gather around, employing a suite of measures to unveil the skills bound to hearing (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). From questionnaires to the silent watch of auditory behaviors, the path is one of patience. The tools are many, but none hold dominion as the key to success; the cause remains elusive. Tests lay sound upon sound, asking the patient to untangle the threads, to find words or numbers within the noise. Advanced trials record the ear's response to acoustic signals, seeking the whispers of truth within the echoes.\n\nIn the end, the tale of CAPD is one of complexity, a disorder woven into the fabric of the mind's perception of sound, its diagnosis and understanding a journey yet to find its end.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, my path winds toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to lend a hand to the young ones beset by the shadows of abuse and neglect. To offer solace to families fraught with turmoil. The values I carry forth into this endeavor are of service, respect, and an ethical disposition, a steadfast commitment to mend the ties that bind us, and to hone my own craft in this field. These tenets are not merely the creed of social work; they are the compass by which I steer my own life.\n\nThe desire to aid others has long been rooted in my heart, though the journey remained shrouded. Through the corridors of my schooling days, I bore witness to souls fleeing their demons, denying the darkness that trailed them, some grasping at the frailest of branches to cope. It was this tapestry of human struggle that led me to seek a degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead was still uncertain, and upon my departure from Piedmont College in the year of 2009, I paused. That summer, as the days grew long, a friend beckoned me to her side where a boy of sixteen summers sat, nerves etched across his face. He was fleeing from the hands of cruelty, seeking refuge. The next day, the tale unfolded as he called upon the law to intervene. I found myself drawn to his family’s door, where I whispered my concerns to the officers of the law, my newly minted degree in Psychology serving as my sole credential. They bade me speak to the parents, for the law’s hands were tied. I faced them, their eyes shifting, spinning tales of their son’s supposed deceit in bringing strangers into family squabbles. It was this moment that kindled within me the fire to pursue social work, to aid children amidst such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the edifice of social work. Our society claims to extol the individual, yet we are shackled by the chains of convention. So why, then, do we strive to mirror one another? I stand apart, eschewing the confines of conformity. In the halls of my education, I stood against the tides of injustice: colors in my hair that defied nature, garments that echoed my spirit, and piercings that charted their own course. I allied with those who sought equality, raising my voice against the specters of racism and discrimination where'er they lurked. In the name of justice, I stand unyielding, my protest a testament to the world I seek to change.",
            "In the quiet tapestry of night where insomnia reigns, the discourse unfolds, bearing the weight of biological and sociocultural threads interwoven. From the depths of lineage, the biological model emerges, whispering tales of genes passed down, tales of health enshrined in the flesh. The sociocultural model, in its turn, surveys the lay of the land, tracing paths through race and ethnicity, through the sprawl of demographics and the edifice of socioeconomic standing. This examination of insomnia, it peers into these lenses, each shard of research a fragment to elucidate the models’ truths and faults alike.\n\nThe specter of sleep disorders casts a shadow, from the primary afflictions to those entwined with mental maladies, and others still, tethered to ailments or substances. The Dyssomnias, they are named: Primary Insomnia, a struggle to embrace the night; Primary Hypersomnia, a battle to evade the day’s clutch; Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to sleep; Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the struggle for breath in slumber; Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, the misaligned dance of time; and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, the unnamed tormentors. Parasomnias, they dwell in the realm of the night’s aberrations, where dreams become nightmares, where terror grips the sleeping soul, where the restless walk unbidden. These are the nightmares, the terrors, the sleepwalking specters, and those unnamed. In the interplay with the mind’s disorders, sleep finds itself ensnared, the Axis I and II disorders weaving their own patterns of unrest.\n\nThe biological model, it gazes upon the tapestry of genes, the legacy of heritable threads, and the physiology etched in the body’s script. In the hidden realms of the hypothalamus, neurons, guardians of sleep and wake, hold sway. Through the lens of mice, the study peers, discerning the GABAB receptors among the orexin-keepers, arbiters of the sleep-wake riddle. Activation of GABAA, it whispers of sleep’s embrace, its inhibition, a balm for anxiety, a lullaby for rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, extends the sleep’s embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). In the echo of these findings, the tale of mice becomes the tale of humans, the genetic and environmental tapestry revealed. A flaw in this receptor, the absence of its song, might render sleep elusive without the crutch of medicine. In the sociocultural sphere, the phenotypic inheritance could spell unrest, the receptor’s change a discord in the sleeper’s life, a shadow over school, career, and the quiet rhythm of daily life.",
            "The years have drawn on like the slow turning of the seasons since I first set foot upon the sprawling grounds of University Park. Two and a half years or four and a half semesters, whichever measure you choose, it amounts to the same span of sunrises and sunsets. And yet for all its grandeur, this place is a labyrinth, a maze of buildings and pathways that confound even the most seasoned wanderer. In those early days as a freshman, they cast me into the far reaches of East Halls, a place perched on the very edge of the campus world. Beyond it lay the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, but they belonged to another realm entirely. To traverse from my solitary room in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a journey of nearly half an hour by foot, a pilgrimage made all the more arduous by the capricious weather that haunts State College.\n\nAn alum, not so far removed from my own time, spoke of days when those dorms stood apart from the rest of the school, separated by vast stretches of barren land. But now those vacant fields have been claimed by sports grounds, imposing edifices like the new Creamery and the health services building, and a ring of apartments encircles them. As the campus swells and spills over its boundaries, the question of how to traverse its ever-expanding domain grows more pressing. What then is the remedy for this quandary of mobility? On this collegiate landscape, it is the bicycle. Yet the mere presence of bikes is not enough. Students must take to them, and the pathways of the campus must accommodate their passage.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to the saddle after years of neglect. He mused why he ever forsook the bike. \"They're a marvel,\" he confessed. \"For a spell, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond the boon to one's health, bicycling stands as the most expedient mode of travel. With a humble bowl of oatmeal and the strength of one's limbs, thirty miles can unfurl beneath the wheels. Like many in the throng of undergraduates, I have taken up residence off campus, a distance from the core as remote as some dormitories. The wisest choice I made this year was to acquire a bicycle. Each day finds me bound for classes in the Thomas building, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot from where I dwell. But on a bike, that time shrinks to a mere five minutes, if the pedals are spun with vigor.\n\nThere lies the trouble, though. Pollock Road is the most direct path to Thomas, yet it is fraught with obstacles, be they on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, I acknowledge, but time is a luxury I cannot afford. Absent the bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach my classes. Such a journey to Thomas would siphon an additional thirty to forty minutes from each day. That accumulates to over two and a half hours in a week, time that is a precious commodity I cannot squander.",
            "In the world spun by Aldous Huxley, there lies a silent thunder of machines and the cold arithmetic of capitalism that forge a dystopia, not a world but a cage of minds. The people therein have traded the soul’s solitary light for the dull glow of communal belonging, molded from the cradle to seek only the fleeting balm of happiness. They move like chessmen on a board, beneath the shadowy hand of the World Controller who dictates their fate. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one peers into the depths of Huxley’s suspicions, where the gears of nascent economies grind with ominous portent. Words of Marxist faith—homogeny, reification—echo through these pages, marking Huxley’s tale as a scornful hymn to the faults in the burgeoning economy of his age.\n\nCapitalism, a specter of satire, is laid bare through the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them, see only their own gain, their vision clouded by the hands that steer them. Ideology, a shroud cast upon the laborers, molds them as surely as the conditioning in Huxley’s world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk possess no will of their own; hypnopædia has sewn within them a ravenous urge to consume, to spend, to drown in indulgence. All this, the handiwork of the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea of one class wielding dominion over another, reigns supreme. The lower rungs of society, oblivious to the strings that bind them, quite literally 'buy into an ideology that supports that structure'—the twin idols of capitalism and consumerism. The higher echelons, the Alphas and Betas, perhaps glimpse the truth but remain unmoved; few, like Bernard, dare to question their ordained place. The dance of the classes is a grim ballet, whispering of the yoke of capitalism.\n\nIn this new world, true kinship between individuals is a ghostly memory. Huxley’s pen draws characters without distinction, shallow forms even among the central players. Perhaps in this, a warning—technology and capitalism have robbed man of will and voice. Love is but a forgotten fable, emotions dulled to shadows. Interactions drift on the surface, men speaking of women as one might of objects, and women recounting their liaisons without shame or depth. The placid acceptance of each class to their lot in this hierarchy lays bare the corrosive hand of capitalism. Their unwavering devotion to their role within the collective mirrors the Marxist lament of the proletariat, assured falsely of their own supremacy so long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past I sat in a course on Islam at the college. The discourse was often aflame with the question of whether Islam bore hostility at its heart. And now more than ever this question seems to echo in the corridors of time. Since the shadow of September 11th fell across the world, I have watched the media change its tune from one of suspicion to a tolerance most extreme in the land of America. In those days of 2001 who could have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage in his blood, would stand as a presidential candidate.  \nThe life of the Prophet holds a strange fascination. What I know of Muhammad’s history seems at odds with the tales told. I had learned he was a conqueror, bending tribes to the will of Islam. Yet the stories paint him as a martyr misunderstood, humble before others, and through him, they claim the truth was revealed and souls sought him of their own accord.  \nThere are echoes of another ministry, for the miracles of Jesus and Muhammad share a kinship uncanny. The tale of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men rings familiar. Such tales weave a tapestry of a humble prophet, one who need not prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. Yet I see a danger in this narrative, an attempt to eclipse the miracle of Christ by another’s hand.  \nThe stories are told as if to bear witness, to show how Islam won souls by its own light. Yet the tales come from afar, third-hand whispers from a murky past. This chain of hearsay does little to convince, casting shadows on the truth it seeks to illuminate.  \nWhat gnaws at me most is the attempt to raise Muhammad as a paragon of humility and grace. Yet history wears a different face, one that speaks of conquest and power. And I wonder if those who follow know the truth of the man who stood at the dawn of their faith.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the teachings of the Nazarene lingered like whispers carried on the wind, yet as the ages unfurled, the faith bore forth on the backs of men drifted from its ancient moorings. The course of Christianity, set adrift upon the tides of time, found itself wandering from the shore of its inception, a pilgrim on a journey it did not recognize. In this modern epoch, a world awakening to itself, there stirs a yearning to cast off the shadows of doctrine piled high through centuries, to peer into the heart of the faith as it was known in its nascence. The old ways, held tight by those anchored in tradition, may yet fade into obscurity beneath the swell of this awakening tide.\n\nIn the hearts of believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken, a longing to sift through the layers accreted over time, to reach the bedrock of the words spoken by the man from Galilee. It is a slow dawning, this return to the beginning, like the inexorable turn of the heavens. A movement will rise, shedding the vestiges of doctrine as a serpent sheds its skin, revealing beneath the simplicity of a truth once spoken plain. As this current flows through the lands of America and Europe, it shall gather its own, calling them to worship as in those ancient days, wherein the teachings of Jesus alone shall guide them. The institution of the church will endure, a lighthouse to navigate these strange waters, but the vast tapestry of belief shall weave itself into a singular thread, drawing the disparate strands of Christendom into a unified whole.\n\nHistory holds its reversions close, and in its annals are tales of empires that once despised the cross, now bearing it high. There was a time when the Roman Empire itself turned from persecutor to patron, and likewise has this land seen its own reversals, from the chains of slavery to the halls of leadership. The coming reversion shall be played out upon the stage of faith, unraveling the skein of history in pursuit of its source, and in this unraveling, diversity shall yield to unity. It is a journey made possible by the reading of the Nazarene’s words not as ironclad decree, but as parable, as metaphor to guide the soul.\n\nTo understand this path, one must trace it to the wellsprings of belief, to the days when only the faith of Abraham held sway. The roots of monotheism, the divine whisperings of revelation, and the authority of the ancient scriptures bound the people as they stood beneath the Roman yoke in days long past. Yet even then, the people were not of one spirit, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who tilled the land and kept the faith in their hearts.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle, there lies a truth as grim as the soot that clings to the factory walls. The nature of men, Sinclair shows us, is a thing of hunger and want, driven by a greed that knows no bottom, a self-centeredness that casts no shadow but its own. They seek only to elevate themselves, to carve out a piece of the world where they might reign unchallenged, giving no thought to those who toil beneath them. The great factories rise against the sky, their chimneys like the spires of some dark cathedral, belching smoke that trails away to the ends of the earth. The owners and managers, these sovereigns of soot, care little for the lives ground beneath the wheels of their ambition. The smoke, the filth, the ruin of both man and beast—these are the casualties of their progress, and they are blind to it all.\n\nSinclair pens a world where money is the only measure of worth, where loyalty and decency are ground down to dust beneath the relentless press of the dollar. The workers, mere cogs in this vast machine, are driven to their limits, cast aside without thought or recompense when their use has faded. In this era, the law is a ghost, offering no comfort, no justice to the laborers who sweat blood to line the pockets of their masters. The managers wield power like a lash, demanding ever more from their workers, who toil in conditions that would break a lesser soul. Sinclair does not need to speak it plainly; the truth hangs heavy in the air. The people of Packingtown, chained to their misery, have no recourse, no refuge. They are slaves in all but name, trapped in a cycle of exploitation from which there is no escape. The unions, those promised saviors, are but another cog in the wheel, thriving on the desperation of the very souls they claim to protect. And so, in this grim dance of power and poverty, Sinclair paints a portrait of a world where men are as brutal as the masters of old, and where the soil of human dignity is forever stained.",
            "In the realm of dreams where Edgar Allan Poe found solace, he crafted \"Dream-Land,\" a poem he held in high esteem among his works. Within its lines, the word \"Thulé\" appears, a relic traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. An island cast north of Britain, a terminus of the known world as the Greeks reckoned. And though Virgil’s hand etched it into history, another source, more contemporary, beckons for recognition. Poe's fascination with the Germanic writers of his time is no secret.\n\nThis reference bears weight, revealing Poe's acquaintance with Goethe’s prose. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" sheds light on the echoes between their verses, deducing an imitation of Goethe by Poe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature paints Goethe as a luminary, his \"Faust\" a poetic drama unfurled in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second at death's door in 1832. Nestled within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a monarch who, upon his queen's demise after gifting him a goblet, drowns in drink and sorrow. The king, in his twilight, bequeaths all save the goblet, his steps leading him to a cliff where he casts it into the sea, shuts his eyes against the world, and follows into oblivion. The kinship between Poe's king in \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's Thulian sovereign is undeniable, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe’s own losses and solace in drink. Faust too found its way into romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's own invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice does Thule emerge from Poe’s pen, a specter in his collected works. \"Ultima Thule\" finds mention in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" yet it bookends the stanzas of \"Dream-Land,\" binding them. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" echo each other, kindred spirits. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator speaks of Thule’s dark, solitary expanse, haunted by the specters of deceased companions, a world drained of color. Goethe’s king, bereaved of his queen, wanders that same shadowed realm, bereft of purpose or the will to reign. The poem unfolds as if the speaker wanders through Goethe’s lament.\n\nGoethe’s presence looms large, an author of significance whom Poe surely knew, if for nothing but his reverence for Tennyson. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's respect was clear, and through Tennyson, Poe’s exposure to Goethe was assured amidst the many renditions that followed Goethe’s original works.",
            "Beneath the indifferent sun of California law, could a soul, battered and broken upon the slick betrayal of an applesauce spill within the confines of a grocery store, lay claim to punitive reckoning by baring the malice of a manager who, twice warned of the peril, chose instead the company of his supper over the sanctity of the floor? A judge may well ponder before casting aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To conjure such a claim, a plaintiff must weave a tapestry of evidence, one that paints the defendant’s deeds in hues of willful disregard for the looming specter of harm, and moreover, that these deeds were steeped in despicable intent. Palmer, she can say that Martin, the manager, should have known the peril that brewed in that untouched spill, for others had fallen in those same aisles, in those same recent months, and with that knowledge, he chose yet to turn his back. Her claim of despicability, though perhaps not the strongest note in her lament, does carry weight, given the history of six such incidents in 2009, and Martin’s continued neglect to guard his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a humble servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin, the manager, with word of the treacherous spill. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the warning with a wave and words that spoke of no time for trifles. A quarter-hour passed, and Mary J. Haddigan, another voice of caution, approached, only to be met with the same indifference. And so at half-past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate upon the applesauce, the floor rising up to meet her with a cold embrace, leaving her with a grievous wound in her back. Before her fall, five others had met with the unforgiving ground in that year alone. Now Palmer stands against D&D, seeking recompense and punishment for her suffering, as we ponder the merit of a motion to strike down her claim for punitive judgment.\n\nIn this land, a plaintiff may reach for punitive recompense in the breach of an obligation not bound by contract, should the defendant’s actions be forged in oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code § 3294(a) speaks of malice as an act intended to wound, or lacking such intent, one must show deeds of despicable nature committed with eyes wide to the danger and yet willfully blind to the rights and safety of others. Courts have called actions malicious when they dance with disregard upon the rights of the plaintiff, when the defendant, aware of the peril their conduct births, steps forward with deliberate abandon. Such is the tale of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the dance of danger was laid bare.",
            "She had always felt a longing, an unyielding desire that could not be sated. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still at seventeen. Over the years, she discerned that what she sought was not a thing but a person. Yet no boy stirred her heart. Some were drawn to her, stumbling through clumsy gestures to win the unwinable, but none captured her fancy. Often she pondered this enigma, searching for a cause to her strange detachment from the affairs of teenage girls. The years of reflection offered theories, but none sufficient to settle her speculation. And so she moved through life, ever questioning her own desires.\n\nA day at home was typically a tranquil affair. Her parents were gentle souls, calm in their ways, and disputes were a rarity. The only discord came from her insistence on independence, a spirited daughter of placid parents, her lively nature a counterpoint to their serene energy, endearing her to many for her warmth and amiability.\n\nBut today was not a day of peace. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice sharp and pained. She dashed to the source, fear mounting as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, grimacing with each labored breath, a repeated \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out with trembling hands to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came hurried and strained, and the daughter saw the depth of her mother's agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how to help.\" Her mother gestured, and the daughter, grateful for the strength she had cultivated, hoisted her and bore her to the car, laying her gently in the back before driving with haste.\n\nThe hospital was a place of sterile scents and quiet dread, but she was too consumed by her mother's plight to notice. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice rising in urgency as she called for assistance. Concerned faces appeared, and a rolling bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. The doctors whisked her into care, leaving the daughter alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet, a simple misstep that had led them here.",
            "The study sought to lay bare that the faithful adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as it is known, might bear upon the heart in ways that the heart might be grateful for. There is talk of a score they call the alternate Mediterranean diet score, and it speaks to a lessened chance of the maladies of the heart and the blood. This diet is a thing of moderation, of green things and fruits and nuts and grains, and the sea’s bounty, and it is a diet that shuns the flesh of beasts and the fats that come from them. The spirits are not forbidden but are to be taken with a measure of wisdom.\n\nThe old studies spoke of the diet's power to ward off death, both from the heart and from life itself, and there was one that took men and women and showed how they were bettered by it more so than by the absence of fat alone. Yet none had turned their eye toward the stroke or the death by stroke.\n\nHere in this work, they followed the lives of women, thousands upon thousands of them, nurses all, from the places in this country where they toil. For years they were watched, their diets measured by their own hand in the telling of what they ate. And most did not falter from this task. Their afflictions were noted, the heart's struggles, the strokes, the deaths that followed. Where proof was absent, judgment was made by what was probable. They counted the weight of their bodies, the smoke of their breath, the medicines they took, and the life they lived outside of their work.\n\nIn the end, they sought to see the truth of the diet’s score and how it related to the heart and its failings, whether they led to death or not. And what they found was a thing of note. Those who held fast to the diet stood apart from those who did not. They walked a path less fraught with the troubles of the heart and the stroke. And the numbers they found told a tale clear and stark. Among the women who held the diet dear, the chance of such afflictions was lessened, the risk they bore was a shade lighter than those who did not.",
            "The sign held aloft reads, Hitler is alive in Burma. \n\nEllen Page, famed for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a corner, the cardboard placard raised above her in defiance. The message scratched out in ink, a testament to the times. Burma, or Myanmar as it is known, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta. A power seized through a coup d’état in the year of our Lord nineteen sixty-two. Two thousand seven brought the rumblings of dissent, the first to stir in a decade. Monks clad in saffron robes led the way, their uprising named for the very color that adorned them. Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, it was a peaceful clamor, the junta begrudgingly looked on. But peace is a fragile thing. Soon the violence swelled, an all-out war some called it, monks against the junta's might. Monasteries fell beneath the military's heel. Foreign eyes were silenced, journalists shackled or shot. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese chronicler of truth, fell on the twenty-seventh of September, slain for bearing witness. Officially, thirteen souls were lost, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, spoke of thousands more, uncounted by any ledger.\n\nSuch tales are not new to this world. The craving for power and control over one's kin stretches long as the history of man. Emperors of Rome claimed divine right to rule, to command every facet of life under heaven's gaze. In Japan, the emperors were gods incarnate, or so the tale goes, leading their people with cell phones and ritual suicide. Our own President, George W. Bush, finds counsel with Ted Haggard, shepherd of the simple, a jesting arm of the Republic's hold.\n\nThere are incidents well remembered, the protest in Tiananmen Square, June fourth, nineteen eighty-nine. Intellectuals, workers, and the young stood against the iron hand of governance. The count of the dead is a thing of mystery, the Chinese state claiming hundreds, while whispers from the Red Cross speak of thousands. And Rwanda, in the nineties, where Hutu blades and bullets sought the Tutsi, a genocide driven by the hand of government. The Third Reich, a dark chapter written across Europe, where Jews were hunted and slain, a grim testament to man's capacity for cruelty.",
            "In the world of jazz where the shadows fall long and the nights stretch deep, Duke Ellington stands as a testament to time, a figure whose music whispers the tales of an era. His life spans the epochs of jazz, shaping an orchestra like a sculptor working marble, each note a chisel strike. The piano was his quiet companion, present yet unobtrusive in the symphonies of sound he conjured. As a composer, Ellington wove tapestries of melody and harmony, each thread a testament to the talents of his band. He built spaces where the music breathed, where soloists could wander and improvise, yet he penned orchestrations so tight they sang with the voices of the men who played them. In this, he was more than a composer; he was an architect of sound, crafting the very soul of the orchestra, each piece a testament to originality and coherence.\n\nThe pages of the Grove Music dictionary speak of Ellington’s innovation, calling upon the memory of \"Creole Love Call,\" wherein the voice itself becomes an instrument, a whisper of the divine. Here, the voice adds texture and color, unburdened by the weight of words. It is an early glimpse into his genius, the ability to weave the voice with the style of his soloists. In the slow drawl of twelve-bar blues, the piece unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: The voice dances with reeds, smooth then rough, a call and response like the wind caressing the leaves.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet takes the stage, unraveling the melody, blue notes hanging like ghosts in the night.\nChorus 3: The clarinet sweeps high, a bird's cry, supported by the piano's gentle syncopation.\nChorus 4: The full band returns, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a conversation.\nChorus 5: A crescendo, reeds soaring, the brass and rhythm sections punctuating with syncopated stop time.\nChorus 6: Back to the beginning, but now the voice growls, an instrument in its own right.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, and the trombone’s dissonant end—a whisper of mystery. Ellington’s voice, a hue in the palette of his music, a signature that permeates all he touched.\n\nA year hence, in \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington marries orchestration with the color of tone. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat weave a tapestry, the voice and horn indistinguishable, a rich sound that echoes through the night. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds upon these foundations, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone a herald of melody, a mainstay in Ellington's kingdom of sound.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do is a murmur in the backwoods of science, a whisper among the trees. Are there unseen hands that guide the course of change, silent laws that bind the paths of life's unfolding? The old scholar D'Arcy Thompson, back in the year of 1917, spoke of the limits of our dreams, how the shapes of the simplest of creatures elude the tongues of numbers. Yet here we stand, no closer to the heart of that mystery. In recent days, the minds have turned to numbers and equations to grasp the ways of mollusks, their shells spun from the thread of time across the ages. We work to unravel the dance of Prunum, to see how their forms are born and reborn, and what forces shape their journey from the past to the now. Through the lens of an X-ray, we capture their secrets, the curves and lines that tell their tale. These we feed into machines, in the manner of CerioShell, to conjure visions of shells that might have been, and might yet be. The fruits of these labors we weave with the hands of experiment and description, to glimpse the greater story of their kind.\n\nIn the mind’s eye, a shell is a corridor of time, a spiral staircase that winds through the vault of the heavens. Each turn, a whorl, encircles an axis unseen, the columella, the spine of the thing. The whorls grow in their own time, marked by sutures like the rings of old trees. The greatest of these, the body whorl, stands last among its fellows. The spire is all that came before, rising to its pinnacle, the apex, and falling to its base. The creature lives within, reaching out through its door, the aperture.\n\nWe gaze upon these shells from all angles—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The common view, apertural, with the aperture facing you and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nCounting the whorls is a simple rite. Begin with the apical view, find the first suture's start. Draw a line asunder the shell, counting from this mark, quarter whorls as they go.\n\nImagine the shell as a series of doorways, traversing time and space as the creature builds its house. You may follow this path, mapping the journey of each whorl’s heart, the breadth and height of the aperture.\n\nThis path may be drawn upon paper or inscribed in the language of numbers. With these symbols, the story of the mollusk’s shell is written, and by their alteration, the tale may change.",
            "In that land stretched across the equator where the sun met the sea, the cries of newborns had not changed much in ten long years. Indonesia, with its archipelago of islands and dreams, found itself on the road to meet the world's grand visions, those Millennium goals. Yet, for the mothers and their children, the road was long and fraught with shadows. The water was cleaner, the latrines dug, but the health of the young and the bearing women lagged behind, like ships in a calm sea, missing the wind to carry them forth to the year fifteen of the new century.\n\nThe tale of healers attending births was one of numbers that shone but with a dim light. Seventy-two in a hundred births now saw a skilled hand, but many were still the hands of tradition, the midwives who could not mend what went awry. And so, the blood flowed and lives ebbed with it, the truth of numbers laid bare. The healing of the young, too, fell short as fewer children were brought to the healers when sickness struck. The records of care after birth were but whispers, incomplete and worrying, a story untold but known.\n\nIn the cities, the knife of the surgeon came to bear upon seven in a hundred mothers, but in the countryside, only two. The chasm between the town and the field was vast, like the gap between the rich man's house and the poor man's shack, where a quarter again and some more could not find a healer at all. The cost was counted in coins and lives.\n\nThe question that lingered in the air was how to mend what was broken. Should the land craft new ways, specific and clear, or should it weave a stronger cloth for all, where mothers and children found care before and after the birthing? The allure of quick fixes was strong, a temptation like the siren's call, but the wisdom of the land cautioned against it. To pour all into one cup left others dry, and healers would gather where the gold shone brightest, leaving the rest to wither. The tale of the world’s fight against the plague of AIDS was told, and the lesson of family planning left behind was learned. To run many races at once was to tire and falter, the weight of forms and ledgers heavy on the mind and hand.\n\nAnd so, the path lay open, a choice between the quick and the lasting, the easy and the just. The land would choose, as it had always done, with the wisdom of its elders and the hope of its young.",
            "In the vast sprawl of time, popular music has unfurled itself like an unending tapestry, its threads woven into so many genres that to enumerate them all is a task of futility. Such is the nature of things, for from the root of each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to name but a few—sprout myriad offshoots, each branching into its own sub and sub-sub genres, a fractal of sound and thought. Among these, heavy metal stands as a testament to the wild diversity and raw expressiveness of popular music over these past forty years. It is a genre of emotion, stark and unyielding, often dwelling in the shadowed corners of the heart. Diverse too, for the genre, almost from its inception, revealed itself pliable, a clay for the sculptor's hand, birthing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres in an ever-expanding lineage that persists to this day.\n\nAnd now, in this age, heavy metal has become a labyrinthine creature of many faces. It is a confluence of themes borrowed from other musical realms, yet it is not without origin. To comprehend the metal that pervades the airwaves now, one must gaze into the heart of the metal movement itself, understanding it as a force, a revolution rather than merely a sound.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement shaped by the darkness. It is a music of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more drama. It eschews simplicity in favor of skill; those who wield its instruments do so with masterful hands, their prowess evident in each note. Unsurprisingly, it is a movement steeped in the haze of drugs, the psychedelic tempest of the mid-seventies having driven artists to the edge of sanity, birthing records that seemed not of this world, their madness attributed to the substances that fueled them. Its qualities are dark, visceral, a stark contrast to the brighter hues of popular music that came before. Later generations of metal drew from the Romantic era's somber depths, echoing its darkness and intensity in their own creation. The lyrical darkness, as expressed by Byrne, is a cornerstone of this movement.\n\nConsider the song Helter Skelter, a glimpse into the darker psyche of the Beatles. It is a sonic rollercoaster, its undulating rhythm a nod to the chaos of drug-fueled perception. This track is oft hailed as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, a retort to the weighty, shadowy tones of a Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, in their ambition, sought to prove their mettle, planting this song like a flag upon The White Album's expansive terrain.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists laid down their dreams in paint, Henri Rousseau, a man given to his own visions, conjured dreams both in the flesh and in the mind. The Dream, a canvas birthed in 1910 by Rousseau's own hands, whispers not only of a woman transfixed amidst the wild wonders of her slumber but also of Rousseau's own aspirations. He yearned, from the first stroke of his brush, for the acknowledgment of those who tread the hallowed halls of art; for the embrace of the world he adored from afar. It was an arduous path he walked, torn between the decision to echo the masters and thus gain entry into their circle, or to wander a solitary road, painting as the muse willed, unshackled.\n\nTo understand this struggle woven into The Dream, one must peer into Rousseau's own tale. Born in the spring of 1844, in the modest town of Laval, northwestern France, he was the son of a tinsmith whose trade brought modest comfort. Rousseau's education was not in the arts, but in the mundane service of tolls and tariffs, until the age of forty, when fate's cruel hand left him bereft of his beloved Clémence and all but one of their children. It was grief that led him to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth in the pigments and the brush, a refuge from the world’s harshness. Unlike his peers, who painted the peasant with romantic eyes, Rousseau painted with the sincerity of one who knew the common lot of man.\n\nThe yearning Rousseau felt for acceptance among the art world's elite is a longing that can be understood in the scope of his life. An outsider, self-taught, entering the arena of art at an age when many are well settled into their craft, he labored alongside giants whose names echoed through the salons. It was only as the likes of Matisse began to ascend that Rousseau's own star flickered into notice. In the pages of Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of these two men, not as rivals, but as travelers on different paths. Matisse, wary of the familiar, sought to avoid the trite, while Rousseau, in his heart, wished only for a place among the accepted, to paint with such convention that he might secure his seat at the table of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the vast expanse of human thought, many a thinker has pondered the kinship between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. There lies, I reckon, a reason deep in the marrow of existence for this bond. As Keats mused in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are entwined, inseparable. Much of what we glean from life comes through the hard school of experience or the guiding hand of education. Yet, there is a curious appreciation for ethics and aesthetics that needs no such tutelage. They exist as if waiting to be discovered, not instructed. In their essence, they seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our reckonings with morality and beauty are endeavors to understand why a painting or a tale is beautiful or why an act is moral, not a ledger of rules to craft such things.\n\nIn the realm of critique, words fall short of capturing the true essence of what is good or beautiful. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance. Discussions may swirl around its composition or the mysteries it holds, but these fail to truly explain its greatness. When asked about a beloved work of art or literature, folks often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into the why of it all. Art and morals elude complete reduction to mere descriptors of their traits. As Flannery O'Connor put it, stories say what cannot be said otherwise; they speak truths beyond the reach of mere statements. No matter how we dissect a literary work, a fragment remains, transcendent and untouched. Ethics shares this ineffable quality. Wittgenstein tells us ethics cannot be expressed, for it is transcendental. This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the shared power of art and morality, binding them together in their timeless dance.\n\nFor morality and art are bound by their profound impact on us at a level that defies explanation. They speak to us in a language beyond words, touching the very core of our being. This bond is perhaps strongest in the realm of literature. As McKean observed, what sets literature apart from other arts is its moral essence. While moral standards might find no place in music or the like, they are as integral to literature as they are to life itself. To live is to navigate values, and literature resonates with us because of the values it reveals.",
            "The land now known as Germany stands as a formidable force, a realm woven with a tapestry of culture stretching from the shadowed alps of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This same spirit breathes through Köln by the Rhine, across the heartlands to the Saxon bastion of Dresden upon the Elbe. It is a land of many sources, birthed from the bones of tribes long past.  \n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, whispers its origins in the halls of scholars and the minds of historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name before it crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaul. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, spoke of the Germans as those beyond the reach of Rome, a word borrowed from the Gauls to mark the boundary of conquest. The roots of the name are tangled and uncertain, some say it spoke of spears or the noise of battle, others of neighbors in a tongue long forgotten.  \n\nTacitus, that old chronicler, wrote of these people in his ancient tome, declaring them pure and unmingled with the world beyond. He pondered who would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for the cold embrace of Germania, a land wild and unyielding, save for those whose hearts called it home.  \n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions to the edge of Germania in search of spoils, yet often returned to the heart of their empire. The Germanic tribes stood at the fringes, trading their goods and their strength, serving in the legions of Rome, a quiet presence on the edge of the world.",
            "In the shadowy world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its crooked paths through hearts and minds, a tool as potent for deception as a serpent's bite. Yet, like all masks, it wears thin, and there comes a time when a soul must shed the borrowed skin or risk becoming a ghost of its own self. To peel away such layers can leave a person stranded, adrift from those they once held dear. The heart must choose between the essence of one's being and the fragile threads of connection, for though some may shrug off the trickery, others may find their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nIn the twisted dance of gender's guise, the stakes rise higher, for it stirs the question of why one would shun their face to don another's form. Viola steps into this masquerade, a shield against the perils of a strange land: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In her guise, she finds sanctuary, yet the cost is a severance from the sisterhood of women, a solitude deepened by Olivia's love, misled by the twin faces of Viola and Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Caught in this web, Viola must wrestle with the silent longing that stirs between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn the eyes of today, Twelfth Night reveals how disguise can unearth the truths buried beneath propriety's surface, drawing out desires unspoken. Olivia and Orsino find themselves entangled in emotions that Viola's presence ignites. Does Olivia's heart beat for Cesario as a man, or does she yearn unawares for the woman beneath? The swift turn of her affections to Sebastian suggests a parody of those who judge by appearance alone, as Olivia declares the bond of kinship over passion: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the play unfolds, a mirror to the complexities of the human heart, where deception lays bare the truths we dare not speak.",
            "The tales of German colonial rule are etched deep with the ink of brutality, a specter that looms large over the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the land then known as German South West Africa. Yet to paint the expanse of a colonial empire with but a single brush would be folly. The German dominion, a mosaic of lands and peoples, bore witness to a tapestry of governance as diverse as the landscapes it encompassed. The promise and reality of education followed suit.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the remnants of German East Africa, which the world now knows as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they found among the people a surprising bloom of literacy and learning. It was a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education, which some chroniclers of the time did not hesitate to commend, not just in Tanganyika but in the distant reaches of Kamerun and beyond.\n\nYet in the lands of South West Africa, a harsher tale unfolded. Unlike their counterparts in the east, where the state's hand had shaped schools and guided the minds of the youth, here the education of the native was left to the fervor of missionary zeal, scantily aided by the government’s coffers. Indeed, the government reserved its resources for the education of Europeans, crafting schools of the state and casting a tighter rein on the mission schools that did exist. This divergence in policy left its mark long after the German banner was lowered. While other colonies could boast of learned natives, South West Africa remained largely a land of shadows, untouched by the light of education, its people unlettered and silent.\n\nThe reasons for this divergence are manifold, a knot of social, political, and economic threads. This discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and the powers that once claimed dominion over these lands. The chronicles of education in the German empire are numerous, penned mostly in the tongue of the empire itself, during or soon after its time of rule. At first, these works endeavored merely to sketch the contours of educational systems. But with time, writings in English broadened the horizon through comparative studies and deeper examinations of specific educational facets. These studies laid bare the stark differences that lay between the colonies.\n\nThe most notable work, Cohen’s study, delves into the heart of this paper’s inquiry, drawing comparisons between the systems that took root in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen argues that the settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the educational landscape of the colony.\n\nSouth West Africa, by the grace of its temperate climes and despite the desert's embrace, attracted a European populace larger than most of Germany’s other distant possessions. In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites called it home, outnumbering those in East Africa, the next closest in settler count, where just over five thousand souls lived under the German sun.",
            "The tale of two nations, the United States and Mexico, is one marked by a rivalry that spanned the years like a shadow cast long upon the land. It was a saga that stretched from the year of our Lord 1836 unto 1893, a span of fifty-seven years filled with strife and discord. The apex of this enmity was the war they called the Mexican-American War, fought between the years 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in its relentless march, did lay claim to the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, wresting them from the grasp of Mexico. Battles and skirmishes flared between these nations, a conflagration that found its peace only as the world edged toward the Great War. The roots of this contention lay deep in the soil of ideological and cultural divide, a clash of gods and traditions, a collision of material desires (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThus it is, that nations bordering one another are often locked in such rivalries, their contiguous lands breeding grounds for discord. The United States and Mexico are but one stone in the mosaic of border-bound enmities. David M. Pletcher (1977) spoke of it thus: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). While other Latin nations found a more amiable path with the United States, these two stood apart, their histories entwined with rivalry.\n\nReligious strife cast its shadow too, a specter that haunted this relationship as it has many others throughout the annals of history. Sally Frahm (2001) opined that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological battle was not one of political systems but of the very gods they worshipped, a legacy of distrust bequeathed from the English and Spanish colonial pasts, a barrier to any semblance of peace between these two great nations.\n\nIn the chronicles of Diehl and Goerts (2000), seventeen disputes are recorded in this period of rivalry. Most were territorial, born of border raids and frontier woes, the land itself a tinderbox ready to ignite. Bandits and outlaws plagued the borderlands until the day came when both nations resolved to impose their martial might upon these lawless expanses (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAnd so, the rivalry waned as Mexico found itself in thrall to the United States, dependent in ways both subtle and overt (Schmitt 1974 p. 109). As the century drew to its close, the ambitions of America shifted from the conquest of land to the dominion of economic sway over its southern neighbor (p. 110). Thus did a chapter close, not with a clash of arms but with the quiet conquest of commerce.",
            "Fifteen years past and without warning I found myself cast adrift by an ailment unknown to me, a shadow slipping silently into my life. Once, I wore the white of a nurse, my hands steady and sure, a choice born of a need as deep as the roots of an old tree, seeking the safety and certainty denied me in younger years. The refrain that echoed through my youth was this: work awaits where the sick line the halls, an endless procession of need. And so, though my heart leaned toward the path of science and the pen of a journalist, I chose the care of the infirm.\n\nYet there I stood, age forty-six, solitary and with pockets near empty, robbed of the work that had defined me. Disabled still, fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security’s meager sustenance has left me hollow, nothing of possession to claim as mine. Each dawn breaks upon a struggle anew, an unyielding test of my security and the fragile remnants of esteem. Certainty has fled my life, save for this one truth: I owe my survival not to my own strength, which falters beneath true calamity, but to the steadfast arms of kin and a few loyal companions.\n\nLife’s emergencies, vast and minute, are the only certainty, for no preparation can steel one against every storm. The nation’s reliance on the crumbling edifice of government aid has grown weary and frail, yet there lies a greater wisdom in rekindling trust among neighbors, in learning again the art of giving and receiving aid rather than each soul retreating to solitary defenses.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, the supposed backbone of this land, belies a deeper truth. Our ancestors, those who braved the great mountains in their wagons, leaned not on singular strength but on the bonds of compassion and shared sustenance. Alone, they would have perished.\n\nSo, prepare as you must. I have done so myself. A kit for disaster, the means to purify water, and the tools to seal windows against unseen threats. My shelves hold candles, matches sealed against the wet, and cans enough to stave off hunger. If you have the land and know-how, let your hands grow sustenance from the soil. But in all your preparations, do not forget the faces next door. Know your neighbors, for in their eyes lies the strength none of us possess alone.",
            "In a time long past, in the shadows of antiquity, a prince was born into the world who would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey away from the clamor of worldly desires toward a serene enlightenment, and from his teachings sprouted the roots of Buddhism, the most ancient branch of which bears the name Theravada. This faith, enduring through the passage of twenty-five centuries, has morphed as the years have worn on, its visage altered since the days when the Buddha himself walked the earth. One might see this in the land of Sri Lanka, where the people keep the water-cutting ceremony, a rite unmentioned by the Buddha yet heavy with significance for monks and laymen alike. These changes weave through the fabric of the faith, from its outward traditions to the very marrow of its doctrinal beliefs. The Theravada community, both cloistered in monastic life and in the world of the laity, has been shaped and reshaped by forces from within and without, both kind and cruel.\n\nThis tale requires understanding of certain terms that will surface again and again. Internal versus external, we say. Internal, born of those within the Buddhasasana, no matter their robes or lack thereof. External, from those who walk other paths. Hostile, those forces that wound or wish harm upon the Buddhist fold. Benign, indifferent forces, neither wishing to aid nor injure, though they may do either unbidden. These shall be the guideposts in this telling.\n\nFirst we must peer into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, to the doctrines that form its core. The Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the sacred law, contained within the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the philosophical depths. Herein lie truths like Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering that clings to life; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Through these truths, one may break the chains of Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara shattered, desire, hatred, and delusion shall also fade, and enlightenment may be grasped. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law for living: for the layman, five precepts to guide the soul; for the monk, a myriad more. But at the very heart lies the four noble truths. First, that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is its cause. Third, that the chains of suffering can be broken."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men speak of agreements and the nature of things unseen, culture casts its long shadow. It is a specter defined as much by its absence as by its presence, by the echoes it leaves in the soul and the weight it bears on the tongue. Culture is no monolith, no singular entity, but a multitudinous sea. To say that all Russians are steadfast as the northern winds or that all Japanese move with the yielding grace of willow branches is to paint the world in the colors of folly. These broad strokes miss the contours that matter, the subtle plays of light and dark that shape the terrain of negotiation. To step into the world of another is to see through the veil of one's own making, where the familiar dances with the foreign, and understanding is a bridge built from the stones of comparison.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another's culture is a journey through time and trial, a path that winds through the pages of history and the shadows of prejudice. It is not for the judge to pass sentence nor the reformer to remake, but for the traveler to accept the world as it is, to navigate its currents with care. Especially when the winds are against you, when the ground beneath your feet is strange, respect is the compass that will lead you past the reefs of misunderstanding and toward the open sea of accord.\n\nYet let it be known that culture knows no bounds of nation alone. Within the walls of commerce, cultures rise and fall like the tides. A company may build its house on the sands of long hours or the shores of leisure. It is in the cut of a suit, the cadence of a voice, the delegation of power, that one sees the hand of culture at work. Philanthropy may be a river flowing freely or a spring tapped by command. Look closely at the fabric of American enterprise, stitched with threads of diversity and variance, and see the quilt of thought that lies beneath. Even where the surface seems smooth, the depths promise complexity.\n\nValues are the compass rose by which the currents of culture are charted. They tell the why of a thing. Should a culture hold dear the sanctity of face or the balm of harmony, know that no man will disgrace his kin or master for the sake of gain. Where the bargain is king, the game is played to the last breath. These truths must be known before words are spoken, before hands are clasped across the table. Yet the wise negotiator sees beyond the mask of culture, seeks the man behind the role, for it is there that the true language of negotiation is learned.",
            "In the silence of the ancient text, the fool whispers to himself a denial of the divine. Such is the lamentation of Psalm 14, a refrain echoed in the musings of St. Anselm as he ponders the ethereal nature of a God unseen yet ever-present. Here too stands Thomas Aquinas, shadowed by the same inquiry, and thus we are cast into the task of discerning the superior testament to the divine. Yet for brevity's sake, we must assume a common ground in their belief—a God shaped by the scriptures of old, the God of the Bible. To entertain an abstraction beyond their shared vision would undermine the very essence of their defense, for they argue not for gods many but for one.\n\nAnd so we delve into Anselm's meditation, a journey inward, faith as the lantern by which he navigates the dark corridors of the soul. It is within this inner sanctum that he claims the presence of God is known, a truth not external but intrinsic, woven into the fabric of our understanding. His words twist and turn, a labyrinth of thought, yet the heart of it is this: God's existence anchored in the mind’s eye, self-evident and unassailable.\n\nContrast this with Aquinas, who stands upon the firm ground of reason, eschewing the ethereal for the tangible. His is a God proven by the world’s own mechanics, a deity revealed through the lens of empirical scrutiny. To him, faith is but a crutch unnecessary, for his God is found in the logic of motion and cause, in the necessity of existence and order. Five paths he lays before us, each a testament to the rational soul, each a puzzle piece fitting in the grand design that speaks to the divine presence.\n\nIn the end, neither argument holds the whole truth, for each is but a facet of the same jewel, reflecting the light of understanding in different hues. Yet through their words, we glimpse the eternal, a whisper of the divine that stirs the heart and challenges the mind.",
            "In the craft of writing, authors wield various tools to evoke a certain sentiment or posture toward matters of consequence. Among these tools, some prove more potent than others. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, such techniques abound, woven into the very fabric of the narrative. Fitzgerald, with a meticulous hand, pairs adjectives and nouns in uncommon unions, casting a particular aura upon his subjects. At times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, employing it with deliberate intent. Within the pages of his novel, Fitzgerald imbues colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink with profound significance. Through The Great Gatsby, he constructs a language of colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, to evoke a memory of a feeling tied to something of import.\n\nWhite and gray, in Fitzgerald's palette, speak of sameness, with white bearing the sheen of elegance and gray the weight of age and wear. He lays the groundwork for this meaning early on, with persistent refrains of both. Daisy and Jordan are portrayed perpetually \"in white\"—a recurring motif. Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" in Myrtle's presence, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" It is only when Nick perceives the spectacle of Gatsby's festivity that the hues shift to \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald delineates these shades further, painting mundanity in their tones: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the attendees of Gatsby's soirées become \"gray names\" in Nick's ledger, and Catherine’s abode is but \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—the embodiment of uniformity. Common folk and places are cast in white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is strewn with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" a child at the railway is \"gray,\" as is the dog-seller, \"a gray old man.\"\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has suffused white/gray with enough meaning, he wields them to signify insignificance or conformity. This symbology first takes root with Daisy. After an extended absence of these tones, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" transforming her into less a person and more a piece of the uniform landscape, an object of Gatsby's yearning. This technique envelops Daisy, underscoring her role as a mere part of the tapestry: a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,\" and once more, she is clad in \"white\" before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County where the land rolls gentle and the air is warm, the earth yields its bounty with a quiet abundance. The fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens that sway in the soft breeze, the squat forms of squash and broccoli, herbs and the hanging fruits of trees—peaches, lemons—that glimmer like small suns. In that place, the berries grow sweet and honey is gathered, peppers burn their red and green into the soil, and the people there have a hunger for the organic, for the earth's pure gift untarnished by man's hand. Long waiting lists stretch out for the promise of such bounty, and eggs and milk untouched by the ordinary means of production find their way to eager mouths. The land itself opens its arms to those who seek more than sustenance, offering paths for the wandering foot, the watching of birds, the simple pleasure of being amid the living world.\n\nThis is the way of things, a land where the owner might find themselves with the benefits accorded by the government for tending their earth with care, improving the wild spaces, offering the curious a glimpse into the workings of their farm, and perhaps in doing so, finding a way to sustain both themselves and the land they hold dear. The organic way is not without its burdens. It demands the sweat of labor, the vigilance against pest and weed, the nurturing of the soil without the crutch of chemical aid. The losses are keenly felt, for the scale of such endeavor is small, the hands few. Yet in this, there is the promise of life more diverse, the land teeming with what might otherwise be lost to the sterility of the conventional.\n\nThere is a place in this tale, a parcel set against the town of Potrero, lying in the unincorporated reaches of San Diego County. A span of 160 acres where chaparral and the nonnative grasses of the Mediterranean meet the oak woodland that stands sentinel beside the Cleveland National Forest. It is a realm within the East County Southern Foothills, where the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan casts its net over many a creature and plant. Over a hundred of them, some teetering on the brink of oblivion—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, those fragile wings of certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher among them. Others are slipping from us, like the burrowing owls whose homes are threatened.\n\nThe land bears the marks of those who came before, the Native Americans who walked its soil for untold ages, and later the ranchers and sellers of cordwood who laid their claim in the 1800s. This land was once a homestead, a place for grazing and the harvesting of wood through the passage of years. Here I chose to lay my gaze upon a property, drawn from the pages of real estate, to seek out the paths a small farmer might tread, searching for the aid that government might offer to ease their burden and preserve the wild that their toil tends to. As a beacon, I found an organic farm nearby, a model for what might be wrought from this land by hands willing to dream and to labor.",
            "In the dusky quiet of the world, there exists a bond between brothers that time nor tempest can sunder. It's a tether woven with threads of love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, each strand a testament to their shared blood and shared fate. Brothers know each other in ways that no one else can fathom, for in the eyes of one lies the reflection of the other, a strange mirror of the soul. And it is in the darkest hours, when the world seems to tilt towards oblivion, that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be stained with virtue or vice. These emotions, when unfurled, demand their due, and the understanding of such demands is to reckon with their price. For when a man looks into the eyes of his brother and sees there his own visage, he sees not the mask the world perceives but the essence of his being. In the deeds he commits, and the shadows those deeds cast, his true nature is revealed. In the tale of \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this perilous path, their hearts a battleground of emotions fierce and wild. Through a land resplendent in its verdancy, they embark upon a journey doomed from the start. Disappointment, bitter as gall, meets pride, fierce as flame, in the story's dreadful climax, and only one brother emerges from the darkness. The theme winds its way through the characters of the brothers, through the eyes of Doodle and the narrator, who bears witness to the storm within his heart and the world outside, each shaping his steps and the path he treads.\n\nThe heart of the protagonist, it beats with pride—a pride that spurs him from the first steps he takes beside his fragile brother, Doodle, to the last fateful venture they share. Resentment shadows his love, for he yearned for a brother who could match his stride, who could learn the secrets of breath held, of feet flying over earth, of limbs reaching for the sky among the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to rest in the arms of the ancient pine by the barn. But Doodle, frail Doodle, was a child marked by fate, his heart a delicate thing, surviving against all odds. The dreams of the young protagonist shattered like glass, his fantasies dashed upon the rocks of reality. Anger crept in, dark and insidious, leading him to thoughts of ending the tiny life that had so betrayed his hopes. What boy contemplates such darkness? Yet the shadow lifts when the child smiles, a simple gesture that speaks of light and possibility. In that smile, the protagonist finds a flicker of hope, an awakening of the love that lay dormant beneath his pride. His resolve, it seems, was but a shadow in the presence of his brother's light.",
            "In the vast and shadowed labyrinth that is the human mind, one finds a tangle of complexities and creations, an engine of thought and wonder. As the world spun forward from the firelit caves to the towers of glass, the image of the mind shifted with it. Once likened to a tablet of wax, then a parchment, then a tome, and now a machine of wires and circuits. Yet in all these likenesses lies a folly, for in their simplicity they veil the truth of the mind's mystery.\n\nThe senses are the gates through which the world enters, each a whisper of the earth turned into signals of light and sound and touch, electric and chemical. The mind, in its silent depths, takes these murmurs, weaving them into shapes and meanings, a dance of bottom and top, rising and falling like the tides. Consider the sight of a dark box upon a pale expanse, the eye gathering the hues and lines, the brain discerning the box from the nothingness, a dark shape against the light. Yet the mind, knowing more than it sees, tells you this is no mere void but a thing of substance, a box and not a hole.\n\nAnd as the world floods in, there stands a sentinel of attention, choosing which echoes to heed, which to let pass into the depths. It spares you the blades of grass beneath your feet, yet in the clamor of voices, it plucks your name from the air. In this filtering, the mind’s work is never done, ever sifting, ever weaving.\n\nTo hold what is known, the mind must bind it in memory, each a thread in the tapestry of thought. There are memories that flicker and fade, others that linger long. They are encoded, each sense its own tongue, be it the shape of a word upon the page, the sound it echoes, or the meaning it holds. Once bound, they must endure. In fleeting memory, perhaps it is a spark that leaps the gap between cells. In the deeper wells of memory, it may be the very frame of life itself, a structure of proteins holding fast.\n\nThe knowing of things, how they sit within the mind, has been drawn in many maps. Some speak of webs of meaning, nodes of thought connected by threads unseen, like stars in a constellation. Thus a chair might find itself beside a table, and both might touch upon the notion of wood, each a stepping stone upon the river of thought. \n\nIn all this, the mind stands a testament to the unfathomable, a testament to what it means to see and to know.",
            "In the year 2007, the land of America found itself ensnared in a relentless financial maelstrom. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the once steadfast bastions of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations of the nation lay broken and desolate. This recession lingers still, and so we are compelled to ponder the origins of this calamity and seek a path to forestall its recurrence. The crisis, born of avarice and naïveté in the halls of power, saw banks and firms driven to dispense sub-prime loans upon a financial edifice ill-equipped to bear such weight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the yoke of pressure, took to underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When the weight of default bore down upon the borrowers, the banks, bereft of capital reserve, unleashed chaos upon the repackaged mortgages they had sown, casting the economy into turmoil.\n\nThe seeds of this financial debacle were sown in the soil of 1999, during the reign of Clinton, a president with eyes set on a second term. He sought favor with the populace, and so his administration loosened the reins on lending, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow. A voice from that time, Steven Holmes of the New York Times, spoke of Fannie Mae, the nation's titan of home mortgages, bending under the weight of the administration's demands to expand loans to those of modest means, while the specter of shareholder profit hung heavy. Holmes foresaw the reckoning, a government-subsidized behemoth teetering on the edge of ruin in an economic downturn, reminiscent of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. As foretold, indiscriminate lending would herald the downfall of the economy.\n\nThe confluence of many forces plunged the economy into chaos. The architecture of mortgages transformed into something new and inscrutable. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations intertwined the fates of multiple sectors with the housing market, leaving households and financial markets precariously leveraged, vulnerable to even the slightest shift in price.\n\nThe bubble, bloated and fragile, burst at last, and those financial titans who had feasted on mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five great investment banks of the nation bore the weight of $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, a burden that equaled near a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers lay dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced into the embrace of commercial banking with its strictures and constraints. Fannie and Freddie, crushed under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, fell into the hands of the government in the autumn of 2008.",
            "In the quiet spaces of a tale, where the words stretch out like the land at dusk, there lies exposition. A place where the writer, if unguarded, may soar high on wings of prose only to find the ground rising up to meet them too soon. It is a place where readers might find their eyes growing heavy, their fingers restless upon the page, or the cursor hovering over that \"Back\" button with a curse muttered low. Even Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has been known to hurl admonitions at the screen when confronted with a deluge of superfluous detail.\n\nExposition is a treacherous companion.\n\nThose who read with care have long grasped the tenet, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet even Dr. Merlin is ensnared by the siren call of unwelcome verbosity, where nothing stirs, or worse, where too much is said. It is the whisperer perched upon the shoulder, urging the writer to unburden themselves of history, to clear the path for the tale's heart (not to be confused with its twin, urging every fragment of a character’s past be laid bare).\n\nTo tell is to lead the audience through the annals of what has been, in prose stripped bare to its bones. In the cinema, it is the moment when one character unspools a yarn of consequence to another, much like a mariner ancient and weary of his tale. In the pages of fiction, it is the author who whispers these truths.\n\nImagine a story unfolds, and in it, the heroine meets her love in a time and place long past. They wed in grand fashion, and before her very eyes, he is taken from this world. Would you not expect these moments to stretch beyond mere pages, to breathe life into their dialogue, to let the husband’s nature unfurl, to speak through word and deed the depth of his love? Would you not expect the heroine to reveal through action and thought how her life was reshaped by his presence, how he was the sun to her days? If the story insists upon such truths, would you not wish to feel the weight of his absence, to join her in that mourning, to find yourself bound to her journey?\n\nThus, the tale must bear flesh upon its bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of words, it falls to you to clothe the narrative in life. (*glances at the metaphor, breathes deep, and continues*) There is a lure to hasten through the tale’s weave. Perhaps a character steps forth, and you know his past: once he flew with the Air Force, now he keeps vigil over a gas station in the night, twice wed with no progeny, a man who finds solace in fishing, dreams in secret of owning that station, and began his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I sat before the screen and watched the tales unfold from the heart of Columbus, Ohio. The first flicker of life came through NBC 4's broadcast that morning in the heat of August, the year being 2011. It began with a man from Ashley, Ohio. A wicked tale of a husband named Shad Hostettler who had taken a knife to his wife, her name yet a mystery to the world. They put his face up for all to see, a visage stained with malice, and yet they lingered but a moment, two minutes of news time, for the story was still fresh and bleeding.\n\nNext came the account of a young man, Travis Buyers, just eighteen years of age. He had been felled by gunfire in the early hours, Sharon Woods the place, and his life hung in precarious balance. The culprits were shadows, unknown, and the SWAT Team waded into the mire of investigation. This tale too was brief, perhaps because Travis was a black youth, and such stories often slip by unnoticed. I have seen it, the way the media drums a furious beat for the white child or the missing white soul, while the plight of minorities whispers by like a breeze scarcely felt.\n\nThen there was the report of a bullet hole, a .22 caliber remnant lodged in the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. They surmised where the shot had come to pass, and Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand-dollar promise for the one who could lead them to the shooter.\n\nThe weather came next, rain and storm clouds hovering on the afternoon horizon for Saturday. Temperatures promised to cling to the low eighties, a bait to keep the watchers hooked to the unfolding narrative.\n\nA tale of robbery followed, a Clime Road UDF in Columbus had been struck by a man cloaked in a hoodie, skin as dark as the night that hid him. They spent words upon his complexion, his height, his weight, as though these things alone mattered.\n\nLastly, they spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a convict from the sprawling plains of Texas. He had woven a web of marijuana from Texas to Ohio, a kingpin they called him. Twenty-five years they sentenced him, though they chose to say \"300 months,\" a curious choice of words, perhaps to twist the knife of time deeper. They noted his Hispanic roots, a detail that seemed to float in the air without tether to the tale they wove.",
            "An exchange traded fund, known to those who wander the financial plains as an ETF, is a creature born of the market, designed to mirror the movements of indices and commodities, or a basket of assets like the index fund itself, yet it moves with a freedom uncommon, trading as a stock might upon the exchange. It offers the manner of diversification known to an index fund, yet carries the perks of holding a single stock, such as the short sale, the margin purchase, and the acquisition of but a solitary share. These lures are indeed potent, yet the expense ratios of ETFs remain low, beneath those of the average mutual fund. But in the shadows lie the costs, the commissions on any trade, much like those that accompany a stock order. The variety of funds is vast and varied, and though these benefits are laid bare, the wise investor must always question if the promise of diversification rings true and to what degree. Here, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the top ten holdings that form its essence, to see if the virtues of a singular ETF might rival those of a portfolio crafted from the ten stocks themselves, and whether a more cunning arrangement of these stocks might yield a sharper ratio or greater return.\n\nTo judge the ETF, we shall not burden ourselves with every holding within, but focus on the foremost ten, which claim 63.58 percent of the assets. Below are these ten, with their share of the whole.\n\nTo seek how well these ten stocks embody the ETF IHF entire, we take their present percentage of assets, normalize it to a full hundred, and from there calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely these ten stocks, in the measure the ETF hath decreed through its holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are laid out in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is plain that a portfolio of merely these ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent greater than the ETF itself, a 16 percent elevation in gains. The Beta of these ten is also .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. Thus far, it seems that a portfolio of only the top ten might offer a higher return with a lesser beta. Yet, there lurks the chance that the means of these two portfolios are not so different as they might seem.\n\nTo discern if these portfolios are indeed different, we must measure the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, and normalize them to a full hundred, to weigh their total standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the turning pages of time, as one stares back upon Figure 17, there comes a fall, sudden and steep, of the commuter log submissions in the third moon of the project. It was a thing that weighed heavy on the heart, the reason for which lay shrouded in the mysteries of human behavior and the cold grasp of winter upon a New England campus. The world turns somber, and the wheels of bicycles cease their turning, footsteps falter upon the frostbitten earth. December, a harbinger of semester's end, finds souls burdened with the reckoning of academic toil, the tallying of grades, and the ceaseless march toward holiday respite. In such a time, the task of recording one's passage to and fro may well have slipped beneath the currents of consciousness.\n\nThe season of festivity and flight from the halls of learning gives rise to a month-long void, a time when scholars and teachers alike find no cause to cross the threshold of the institution. The spring comes not until late January, a fact that casts its own shadow upon the number of logs that might be expected. Yet February's emptiness stands unexplained, a puzzle to confound the senses. It could be said that any endeavor born of spirit and vigor waxes strongest at the outset, only to wane as the days grow dark. In the face of such decline, we birthed the Carpool Challenge Week, a clarion call in March to stir the embers of enthusiasm, and indeed, the numbers rose anew.\n\nThe road we walked was fraught with the challenge of sustaining the flame against both the ebbing tide of interest and the peculiar rhythms of academic life. Another trial came in the form of man's affinity for the automobile, a love affair with liberty and solitude that runs deep in the veins of the land. To turn hearts toward other paths, one must offer enticements, tokens of worth. We dispensed prizes, tokens of appreciation from the local merchants of food and drink, the healers of muscle, the keepers of books, and even the great emporiums of the nation. There lingered a question, a thought unspoken—what might have been the effect of grander rewards, a fine bicycle or a car of hybrid or electric kind, to stave off the decline? The prizes, immutable through the journey, might have grown in stature as the months passed, a beacon to draw the wandering eyes. Gift cards sufficed in the beginning, but what if, come December, the promise of bicycles had been whispered, and by January, the allure of a motor car? One can only wonder if the tide might have turned, if the engagement might have risen like the sun after a long, dark night.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress, I found myself drawn to the flickering ghosts of early Edison films, those trick films that danced between the years of 1895 and 1901. Fifteen in all, each a testament to the art of illusion, crafted through the alchemy of creative editing. My journey through these spectral reels was not merely one of observation, but a study of their poetics, tracing the arc of their evolution and the rare deviations that emerged in the latter days of this period. \n\nThese films stand as relics of a bygone era, bound to the stage and its ancient customs. Their frames are locked within a frontal proscenium, the camera a steadfast sentinel, unmoving, capturing long and medium shots with a steadfast adherence to the principle that one shot equals one film. Yet, as the century turned, a few dared to breach these confines, introducing the audacity of multiple shots.\n\nThe essence of these trick films lies in their setting, the interior stage framed by the proscenium's rigid boundaries. The camera remains as still as a forgotten sentinel, bearing witness to the actors' movements confined to the horizontal plane. They do not venture forth towards the lens, nor recede into the background. Such is the nature of Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors traverse the stage laterally, vanishing from sight without the camera's pursuit.\n\nThis proscenium's grip dictates the distance from which we view these performances, favoring long shots and, on rare occasions, medium ones. Never do we find the intimacy of a close-up, for the tradition of theater and vaudeville dictates that the audience must behold the entirety of the spectacle, framed within the stage's embrace. The actors remain in the middle ground, distant from the camera’s gaze, close-ups forever elusive.\n\nIn their simplicity, these early trick films adhere to a singular vision: one conceptual shot defines an entire film. Their brevity, often confined to a minute or less, is a reflection of this constraint, shaped by the mechanical limits of frames per second. Their narratives are mere whispers, a nod to the vaudevillian roots from which they sprang, their magic and sleight of hand captured in fleeting acts. Yet, within this singular vision lies a deception. A trick film's sole shot is often a composite, multiple exposures woven together to conjure the illusion of disappearance or transformation. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early example where a keen eye discerns the seam where Mary’s severed “head” enters the frame, though to the unsuspecting eye it remains a seamless tale told in one breath.",
            "There is a certain irony in the Gothic novel, a paradox of 'Old-New,' as Ian Watt would have it, a curious dance of contradiction that finds its roots in the pages of The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This Gothic mode, oftentimes dismissed and at other moments lauded for its 'terrible sublime' nature, finds itself both shallow and profound (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto stands as the progenitor of this curious genre, crafting from the bones of ancient and modern romances a new form of literary expression. Walpole weaves the old with the new—theatrical flourishes of yore with the mimetic whispers of nature found in modern tales—to birth what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic draws from the well of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition—a tapestry of the past in the face of a world racing towards modernity. Even when The Castle of Otranto first saw the light of day, the term \"gothic\" bore the weight of many epochs and styles, a relic deemed unsophisticated against the tide of modern advancement. Yet it is this marriage of theatrical Gothic and novelistic intimacy, this journey into the psyche of its characters, that grants the Gothic its timeless resonance, lingering as both relic and revelation to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nWithin the Gothic's shadowed corridors lies the concept of chivalry, a vestige of the medieval knightly ideal, retained and reshaped in the original Gothic tale, The Castle of Otranto. For the Gothic scribe, chivalry stood as emblematic of a bygone valor and honor, a mirror held to a society perceived as lacking. Through the chivalric lens, the 'gothic past' becomes a romanticized ideal, hinting at the dawn of Romanticism, striving to elevate the present. Walpole, encircled by political strife and the shadows of unjust censure, perhaps saw in the Gothic era a moral compass, a goodness lost to his contemporary world. In his narrative, this theme finds embodiment in the character of Frederic, a figure whose chivalric virtues are heralded before his presence graces the page.\n\nFrederic, a prince draped in traditional chivalric imagery, bears the marks of suffering and the scars of tragedy, a man thought slain by infidels. The gallant and courteous Knight emerges, exaggerated to the point of Gothic excess, a harbinger of the tropes yet to come (66).",
            "In the quiet hours before dawn, as the world lay in the muted embrace of night’s departing shadow, the ceaseless machinery of commerce stirred to life. Supply chain management, the unheralded orchestrator of goods from their nascent inception to their final destination in the hands of the waiting customer, unfolds its complex symphony of movement and time. It was Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown, who in the year of 1982 sought to give this grand endeavor a name. And thus, supply chain management was christened, a term to encapsulate the intricate dance of planning and execution, a means to quench the ever-thirsting needs of a world spinning ever faster.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast edifice rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The stewards of commerce, the managers, wield these elements like seasoned hands at the loom, weaving the fabric of satisfaction for those they serve.\n\nProduction, the first among equals, stands as the bedrock. It is here that the seeds of all that follows are sown. It is a place where questions of when, why, where, and how are answered, where the whims of the market are deciphered like ancient runes to unveil the desires of those who wait beyond. Once the market’s voice has been heard and understood, the managers set about the task of deciding what to create, how much to create, and where these creations shall spring forth. It is a delicate balance, a dance of numbers and instinct, for to misstep here is to invite ruin. \n\nThe chosen site of production becomes a crucible where schedules are forged and machinery hums with purpose. Every cog, every detail holds weight, for the margin of error is thin, and the cost of miscalculation looms large, a specter of squandered time and treasure. I have seen this with my own eyes, in the cavernous aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, where the very air seemed to hum with the precision of well-oiled processes. There, even the uniforms bore the imprint of meticulous design, a testament to the power of order amidst the chaos.\n\nSupply follows closely, a river of decisions that shape the capabilities of the facility, a testament to strategic foresight. Here lies the question of divisions, each with its own machinery, its own cadre of workers, and its own unique expertise. The manager, like a conductor before an orchestra, must decide which division shall take up the baton, or if the work shall find its way to other hands, other lands. This too is a choice fraught with consequence, for the aim is velocity—the alchemy of achieving quality and flexibility while keeping the relentless beast of cost at bay.\n\nThus, the great wheel turns, an endless cycle of creation and movement, a testament to human ingenuity and the ceaseless march of progress.",
            "Victorian novels, with their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy's pomp and circumstance, often seem to linger in a world far removed from the common man's woes. But there are tales that stray from this well-trodden path, tales like Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights that breathe a different kind of air. They are works cloaked in mystery and tinged with the strange, stepping away from the expected to deepen the souls of their characters, revealing the shadowed motives and tumultuous emotions that lie within.\n\nThere is a passage where young Oliver finds himself adrift in a sea of confusion. The memory of Sikes and Crackit, their arguments echoing like ghosts in his mind, and the sudden crack of gunfire that sent cries into the night. Light and chaos envelop him as unseen forces whisk him away, each vision imbued with an unyielding sense of torment that gnaws at him relentlessly.\n\nIn these novels, mystery often unfolds through dreams or dreamlike states, each serving its unique purpose. In Oliver Twist, these eerie episodes peel back the layers of Oliver's soul, exposing his pains and his dim awareness of the swirling forces around him. When the shooting incident is revisited, it's as if Oliver is caught in a fever dream, reliving the terror as he seeks aid. The passage underscores his helplessness, the events slipping through his fingers like dust, his health teetering on the brink, visions of Sikes and Crackit haunting him. The gunfire overwhelms him, his senses dulled, the unseen hand of fate carrying him away. Pain becomes a constant companion, no longer a shock but a steady drip of fear. In this overwhelming tide, the question of whose hand guides his fate rises like smoke. Certainly not his own, for Oliver seems adrift in a world he cannot command, his spirit worn down by Fagin's creeping influence. A sense of resignation seeps into him, a silent acceptance of despair, numbing his will to act, even in the face of death.\n\nTime slips by in a haze, the day swallowed by night, a night both endless in its silence and fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "Some years past, I found myself in the company of young minds, tending to their struggles in that after school sanctuary. My task was simple, yet profound, to guide them through the labyrinth of their studies, though English and the written word were where my own strengths lay. It was then that I was enlisted by one of the teachers to aid a young lad named Adrian. He could have been third or fourth grade, but what troubled him was the written script, letters that danced away from his understanding. It struck me, peculiar as it was, that some letters he grasped with ease while others eluded him entirely, a mystery not easily unraveled. He was of Latino descent, this I knew, yet his English was as flawless as the sky is wide. Our journey was arduous until the day his mother stepped into the room, her tongue solely Spanish, mine barely passable. But in the exchange that followed, the truth fell upon me like an unyielding weight. It was not the words Adrian struggled with, but a simple lack of familiarity with the English alphabet. Whether this revelation bore fruit for him, I cannot say, but I hold hope that his path has since brightened.\n\nThis tale I recount to cast light upon the silent barricades of language in our schools, a truth vivid in the sunlit expanse of California. It serves to remind us that the barriers are not always as they seem. A child may command the spoken English with the ease of a breeze, yet the written form can stand as an insurmountable wall. We can all agree upon the existence of this struggle, but the question remains: what is to be done? For Adrian, the remedy was simple, though not simplistic, teaching him the alphabet, the sounds. Yet for those who scarcely speak the language at all, the solution grows tangled and complex. There is no singular answer. The path lies not in one approach but in the weaving of many: dual language programs, immersion in the mainstream, the guidance of private tutors, the structure of ESL classes.\n\nTo begin with, the dual language system holds promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking child but for every child. Studies have revealed that those in bilingual programs often surpass their peers. Fear clings to this notion, whispering of wasted resources, of no gain for the majority, but such fears are unfounded. Should these programs become the norm rather than the outlier, all children would glean their benefits. Yet the question persists: how to implement this? To demand bilingualism of all teachers is to court the unattainable. But there lies in possibility the employment of aids, tutors, call them what you will, who can bridge the gap with their bilingual tongues.",
            "From the time we are children, the tales are spun of a world beyond us, vast and incomprehensible. Some are led to the pews of Sunday school, others to the quiet refuge of a temple, while still others wander within their own souls for the truths they seek. Many take on the mantle of faith handed down through generations, while others cast it aside, denying any realm beyond their own narrow sphere of existence. We may adopt a creed only to discard it for another as the years roll on. Whatever path we choose, we strive to shape our identity through the prism of our own spiritual insights. We search for a light in the dark to lead us from shadows to the sun.\n\nA cardinal, my father once told me when I asked his favored bird. We sat upon the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above as we shared our cigarettes. The gutters spilled over, drowning the plants that clung to the edge. He peered into the rain, a gaze that spoke of searching, of remembering. He had grown gaunt, his clothes hung loose, his hair thinned. Still he looked out, avoiding my eyes. I was alone, frightened, unable to voice the depth of my impending loss, for to speak it would make it real for us both. I embraced him, settled back in my chair, and inched closer to him as we watched the rain fall through the dim light of June's end.\n\nHe passed in December, five days after I'd turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation did little but extend his suffering beyond the doctor's predictions; what worth lay in that, when it served only to prolong his pain, was beyond me. What kind of God does this, I wondered in the silence. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, he had ceased listening long ago.\n\nI did not wish to watch him cross from this life to the next. So I did not. I could not bear witness to the end of the force that had given me life. I chose to remember him in his living, not his dying. Besides, I knew him better than most, better even than his kin, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him leave this world. For three days I lay curdled on my bed, awaiting the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "In the dust and the dirt of Caroline, there was a man named John Taylor who held the banner of Republicanism like a torch against the night. A farmer by trade, his hands knew the soil and his heart knew the politics that sprouted from it. He was a voice that spoke of freedom, a voice unyielding in its clamor against the shadow of governance. His heart beat for the land, for the agrarian life which he held as the highest calling, a life that shaped his notions of sovereignty, of Constitutions, and the courts that would pass judgment.\n\nTaylor saw the land of the United States as a blank canvas, unblemished by the weight of old traditions, ripe for the birth of a new order of self-rule. He held firm to the belief in the natural rights of man, a fragile web where the breaking of one strand could unravel the whole. These rights, he said, were sacred, not to be touched by the hands of government. In the wilds of nature, he claimed, strength and cunning ruled, but in civilization, a different order must prevail.\n\nTo forge this utopia, Taylor spoke of a government that knew the dual nature of man's heart, both the light and the dark. He was a man who saw the world in stark contrasts. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he would say, his words heavy with the weight of truth. He called for principles that safeguarded the land, that nurtured the earth, and kept the greedy hand of capitalism at bay. A government of such principles, he believed, would run true no matter the hands that guided it, for the hands of men were ever drawn by self-interest. Yet, this self-interest could be a force for good, so long as it served the common weal and did not give rise to lesser tribes that thrived on the suffering of others. A vigilant eye must watch over the government, lest it stray into the mire of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, was a man of strict sense when it came to the Constitution. He wished for a Federal government as limited as the words on the parchment allowed. He feared the bloat of a great Federal beast, for it would grow tyrannical, and tyranny was expensive. Yet, he knew too well the danger of reading the document without the light of its creators' intent. Even more, he looked to the Declaration of Independence as the true covenant, speaking not of one nation but of many, each a sovereign entity in its own right.",
            "I stood and gazed downwards, the emptiness of thought echoing the view before me. My mind, detached yet aware, dissected the scene with a precision that refused to bind it to any grander understanding. Thoughts drifted through my awareness and vanished, as if my consciousness itself were but a river carrying images away. It was as though I had no thoughts of my own, merely the fluid experience of observation.\n\nOnce upon a time, an artist I knew suggested a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book promised to unravel the mysteries from the pencil’s nature to the mind’s interpretation of lines. It spoke of framing a picture, a square reducing the complexity of a scene—say, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that led to a dining room—into a manageable vision, the fruit isolated on its simple plane.\n\nBut as I stared at the bowl before me, I found no artist’s frame to contain it. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand there in silent wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his love of greenery, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance embraced a spectrum of colors. If I were to claim my own artistic vision, then here lay the genesis of my creation, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found their way to the chosen tool of my artistry, muscles tensing and releasing as my hand moved, the will of my mind manifesting in what could have been the pinnacle of creativity. The water swirled, placid and clear. Fragments of matter broke away, vanishing into nothingness. With a quickening pulse, my hand struck the handle once more. Still, the obstinate brown mass clung to the bowl’s base like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a shoulder’s width apart, and a green tie cinching my neck uncomfortably, I frowned at the insolent heap of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid restrooms. More flushes, more moments of solitary reflection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it wore a padded glove. Straightening, then bending, my hand sank slowly into the water, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "In the twilight of youth, where the world unfurls vast and uncharted, the young find themselves behind the wheel, teetering on the brink of destiny, and the road claims them. It is a confluence of misfortune, where the sinews of inexperience tighten their grip, and the fledgling minds of teenagers falter amidst the perilous landscape of asphalt and speed. The National Institutes of Health speak to the unfinished architecture of the adolescent brain, unfit to bear the weight of the road's hazards. Simple inexperience, a silent specter, lies at the heart of this grim equation. It not only augments the tally of the dead but also ushers forth a litany of rollovers, reckless speeds, and wayward journeys off the intended path.\n\nIn the company of their peers, these young souls often fare worse, for such is the folly of youth to congregate and dare the fates. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted these waters and found a harrowing correlation between the age of those who ride alongside and the frequency of calamity that ensues.\n\nIn the sunlit expanses of California and beyond, measures have been set in motion to tether the wildness of young drivers, provisional licenses that seek to curtail their nocturnal wanderings and limit the companionship of fellow minors. Yet, these measures are but feeble barriers against the tide. The truth lies bare, that the youngest among us, by all accounts, are ill-prepared to shoulder the burdens of risk and responsibility. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, a voice of caution, contends that even at eighteen the mantle is too great. His research, echoed in the pages of USA Today, reveals a predilection for risk, the allure of thrill that grips those not yet nineteen or twenty. It stands to reason that the granting of the wheel should be delayed until the tempest within has calmed.\n\nShould we persist in bestowing driver’s licenses upon the young, the roads will continue to run red with tragedy, the toll climbing ever higher. By the dawn of 2010, the progeny of the Baby-Boomers will come of age, a legion of new drivers poised to take to the highways.\n\nLegislation, clear in its intent, could forge a path forward. Schools might continue to impart the rudiments of driving, laying the groundwork for the journey ahead, yet none beneath the age of eighteen would command the power of a vehicle. A provisional permit could yet be offered, a precursor to full licensure, with requisite hours of practice, echoing the standards of states like California, with its mandate of six hours behind the wheel and fifty in the company of an adult. The statistics of death and ruin span the breadth of this land, and thus a national decree would be a prudent, perhaps necessary, shield for the youth of this nation.\n\nThis proposal, while not novel, is a call to reason, a beacon to guide us from the shadows.",
            "This manuscript delves into the depths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known in the annals as CAPD. It begins with a fleeting definition, like a whisper upon the wind, before moving to the diagnostic journey, studded with the signs and signals that warn of its presence. And in its final chapters, it offers the teacher in a mainstream classroom the tools to aid those students who bear this unseen burden.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, walks a fine line in the realm of auditory perception. It speaks of the central nervous system's dance with auditory information, the way it wields sound like a craftsman with his tools. Defined with precision, CAP stands as the sentinel of perception within the central nervous system. It concerns itself with the neurobiologic symphony that underpins processing, bringing forth the auditory potentials that hum beneath the surface (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). It is a disorder not of hearing, but of translating the world's sounds, where the brain's orchestra fails to play its part, leaving voices entangled with the clamor of the world.\n\nThe echoes of CAPD reach back to a time in the mid-twentieth century, when it bore the name \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In the dusty corridors of research, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari carved out tests for the afflicted children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, laying bare the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System, a model to grasp the unseen workings of perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The winds of change came in 1977, when a national conference ignited the flame of research into the hearts of children with CAPD.\n\nThe disorder manifests with a myriad of faces: the sufferer may wander lost in the tapestry of sound, unable to anchor their senses; they may struggle to discern between the myriad acoustic events that ripple through their consciousness; the patterns of sound may elude them; the subtle shifts in speech, like the sharp edge of sarcasm hidden in a voice, may pass unnoticed; the cacophony of the world may drown each successive sound; the clues that sound offers may wither, leaving no trace for the mind to follow; the sequence of sound may unravel, leaving them adrift upon the sea of auditory chaos (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD calls for an observant eye, a systematic scrutiny of listening behavior and auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others gather around, employing a suite of measures to unveil the skills bound to hearing (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). From questionnaires to the silent watch of auditory behaviors, the path is one of patience. The tools are many, but none hold dominion as the key to success; the cause remains elusive. Tests lay sound upon sound, asking the patient to untangle the threads, to find words or numbers within the noise. Advanced trials record the ear's response to acoustic signals, seeking the whispers of truth within the echoes.\n\nIn the end, the tale of CAPD is one of complexity, a disorder woven into the fabric of the mind's perception of sound, its diagnosis and understanding a journey yet to find its end.",
            "In the pursuit of a calling within the realm of social work, my path winds toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where I aim to lend a hand to the young ones beset by the shadows of abuse and neglect. To offer solace to families fraught with turmoil. The values I carry forth into this endeavor are of service, respect, and an ethical disposition, a steadfast commitment to mend the ties that bind us, and to hone my own craft in this field. These tenets are not merely the creed of social work; they are the compass by which I steer my own life.\n\nThe desire to aid others has long been rooted in my heart, though the journey remained shrouded. Through the corridors of my schooling days, I bore witness to souls fleeing their demons, denying the darkness that trailed them, some grasping at the frailest of branches to cope. It was this tapestry of human struggle that led me to seek a degree in Psychology. Yet, the road ahead was still uncertain, and upon my departure from Piedmont College in the year of 2009, I paused. That summer, as the days grew long, a friend beckoned me to her side where a boy of sixteen summers sat, nerves etched across his face. He was fleeing from the hands of cruelty, seeking refuge. The next day, the tale unfolded as he called upon the law to intervene. I found myself drawn to his family’s door, where I whispered my concerns to the officers of the law, my newly minted degree in Psychology serving as my sole credential. They bade me speak to the parents, for the law’s hands were tied. I faced them, their eyes shifting, spinning tales of their son’s supposed deceit in bringing strangers into family squabbles. It was this moment that kindled within me the fire to pursue social work, to aid children amidst such “simple” disputes.\n\nJustice, too, stands as a pillar in the edifice of social work. Our society claims to extol the individual, yet we are shackled by the chains of convention. So why, then, do we strive to mirror one another? I stand apart, eschewing the confines of conformity. In the halls of my education, I stood against the tides of injustice: colors in my hair that defied nature, garments that echoed my spirit, and piercings that charted their own course. I allied with those who sought equality, raising my voice against the specters of racism and discrimination where'er they lurked. In the name of justice, I stand unyielding, my protest a testament to the world I seek to change.",
            "In the quiet tapestry of night where insomnia reigns, the discourse unfolds, bearing the weight of biological and sociocultural threads interwoven. From the depths of lineage, the biological model emerges, whispering tales of genes passed down, tales of health enshrined in the flesh. The sociocultural model, in its turn, surveys the lay of the land, tracing paths through race and ethnicity, through the sprawl of demographics and the edifice of socioeconomic standing. This examination of insomnia, it peers into these lenses, each shard of research a fragment to elucidate the models’ truths and faults alike.\n\nThe specter of sleep disorders casts a shadow, from the primary afflictions to those entwined with mental maladies, and others still, tethered to ailments or substances. The Dyssomnias, they are named: Primary Insomnia, a struggle to embrace the night; Primary Hypersomnia, a battle to evade the day’s clutch; Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to sleep; Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the struggle for breath in slumber; Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, the misaligned dance of time; and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, the unnamed tormentors. Parasomnias, they dwell in the realm of the night’s aberrations, where dreams become nightmares, where terror grips the sleeping soul, where the restless walk unbidden. These are the nightmares, the terrors, the sleepwalking specters, and those unnamed. In the interplay with the mind’s disorders, sleep finds itself ensnared, the Axis I and II disorders weaving their own patterns of unrest.\n\nThe biological model, it gazes upon the tapestry of genes, the legacy of heritable threads, and the physiology etched in the body’s script. In the hidden realms of the hypothalamus, neurons, guardians of sleep and wake, hold sway. Through the lens of mice, the study peers, discerning the GABAB receptors among the orexin-keepers, arbiters of the sleep-wake riddle. Activation of GABAA, it whispers of sleep’s embrace, its inhibition, a balm for anxiety, a lullaby for rest. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, extends the sleep’s embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). In the echo of these findings, the tale of mice becomes the tale of humans, the genetic and environmental tapestry revealed. A flaw in this receptor, the absence of its song, might render sleep elusive without the crutch of medicine. In the sociocultural sphere, the phenotypic inheritance could spell unrest, the receptor’s change a discord in the sleeper’s life, a shadow over school, career, and the quiet rhythm of daily life.",
            "The years have drawn on like the slow turning of the seasons since I first set foot upon the sprawling grounds of University Park. Two and a half years or four and a half semesters, whichever measure you choose, it amounts to the same span of sunrises and sunsets. And yet for all its grandeur, this place is a labyrinth, a maze of buildings and pathways that confound even the most seasoned wanderer. In those early days as a freshman, they cast me into the far reaches of East Halls, a place perched on the very edge of the campus world. Beyond it lay the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center, but they belonged to another realm entirely. To traverse from my solitary room in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a journey of nearly half an hour by foot, a pilgrimage made all the more arduous by the capricious weather that haunts State College.\n\nAn alum, not so far removed from my own time, spoke of days when those dorms stood apart from the rest of the school, separated by vast stretches of barren land. But now those vacant fields have been claimed by sports grounds, imposing edifices like the new Creamery and the health services building, and a ring of apartments encircles them. As the campus swells and spills over its boundaries, the question of how to traverse its ever-expanding domain grows more pressing. What then is the remedy for this quandary of mobility? On this collegiate landscape, it is the bicycle. Yet the mere presence of bikes is not enough. Students must take to them, and the pathways of the campus must accommodate their passage.\n\nI spoke with a friend who had returned to the saddle after years of neglect. He mused why he ever forsook the bike. \"They're a marvel,\" he confessed. \"For a spell, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond the boon to one's health, bicycling stands as the most expedient mode of travel. With a humble bowl of oatmeal and the strength of one's limbs, thirty miles can unfurl beneath the wheels. Like many in the throng of undergraduates, I have taken up residence off campus, a distance from the core as remote as some dormitories. The wisest choice I made this year was to acquire a bicycle. Each day finds me bound for classes in the Thomas building, a trek of twenty-five minutes on foot from where I dwell. But on a bike, that time shrinks to a mere five minutes, if the pedals are spun with vigor.\n\nThere lies the trouble, though. Pollock Road is the most direct path to Thomas, yet it is fraught with obstacles, be they on wheels or otherwise. There is merit in walking, I acknowledge, but time is a luxury I cannot afford. Absent the bike, walking would be my sole recourse to reach my classes. Such a journey to Thomas would siphon an additional thirty to forty minutes from each day. That accumulates to over two and a half hours in a week, time that is a precious commodity I cannot squander.",
            "In the world spun by Aldous Huxley, there lies a silent thunder of machines and the cold arithmetic of capitalism that forge a dystopia, not a world but a cage of minds. The people therein have traded the soul’s solitary light for the dull glow of communal belonging, molded from the cradle to seek only the fleeting balm of happiness. They move like chessmen on a board, beneath the shadowy hand of the World Controller who dictates their fate. Through the lens of Marxist theism, one peers into the depths of Huxley’s suspicions, where the gears of nascent economies grind with ominous portent. Words of Marxist faith—homogeny, reification—echo through these pages, marking Huxley’s tale as a scornful hymn to the faults in the burgeoning economy of his age.\n\nCapitalism, a specter of satire, is laid bare through the Marxist notion of false consciousness. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them, see only their own gain, their vision clouded by the hands that steer them. Ideology, a shroud cast upon the laborers, molds them as surely as the conditioning in Huxley’s world. The Deltas, Gammas, and their ilk possess no will of their own; hypnopædia has sewn within them a ravenous urge to consume, to spend, to drown in indulgence. All this, the handiwork of the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea of one class wielding dominion over another, reigns supreme. The lower rungs of society, oblivious to the strings that bind them, quite literally 'buy into an ideology that supports that structure'—the twin idols of capitalism and consumerism. The higher echelons, the Alphas and Betas, perhaps glimpse the truth but remain unmoved; few, like Bernard, dare to question their ordained place. The dance of the classes is a grim ballet, whispering of the yoke of capitalism.\n\nIn this new world, true kinship between individuals is a ghostly memory. Huxley’s pen draws characters without distinction, shallow forms even among the central players. Perhaps in this, a warning—technology and capitalism have robbed man of will and voice. Love is but a forgotten fable, emotions dulled to shadows. Interactions drift on the surface, men speaking of women as one might of objects, and women recounting their liaisons without shame or depth. The placid acceptance of each class to their lot in this hierarchy lays bare the corrosive hand of capitalism. Their unwavering devotion to their role within the collective mirrors the Marxist lament of the proletariat, assured falsely of their own supremacy so long as they consume, obey, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past I sat in a course on Islam at the college. The discourse was often aflame with the question of whether Islam bore hostility at its heart. And now more than ever this question seems to echo in the corridors of time. Since the shadow of September 11th fell across the world, I have watched the media change its tune from one of suspicion to a tolerance most extreme in the land of America. In those days of 2001 who could have imagined a man named Barack Obama, with whispers of Muslim lineage in his blood, would stand as a presidential candidate.  \nThe life of the Prophet holds a strange fascination. What I know of Muhammad’s history seems at odds with the tales told. I had learned he was a conqueror, bending tribes to the will of Islam. Yet the stories paint him as a martyr misunderstood, humble before others, and through him, they claim the truth was revealed and souls sought him of their own accord.  \nThere are echoes of another ministry, for the miracles of Jesus and Muhammad share a kinship uncanny. The tale of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men rings familiar. Such tales weave a tapestry of a humble prophet, one who need not prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. Yet I see a danger in this narrative, an attempt to eclipse the miracle of Christ by another’s hand.  \nThe stories are told as if to bear witness, to show how Islam won souls by its own light. Yet the tales come from afar, third-hand whispers from a murky past. This chain of hearsay does little to convince, casting shadows on the truth it seeks to illuminate.  \nWhat gnaws at me most is the attempt to raise Muhammad as a paragon of humility and grace. Yet history wears a different face, one that speaks of conquest and power. And I wonder if those who follow know the truth of the man who stood at the dawn of their faith.",
            "In the dim corridors of history, the teachings of the Nazarene lingered like whispers carried on the wind, yet as the ages unfurled, the faith bore forth on the backs of men drifted from its ancient moorings. The course of Christianity, set adrift upon the tides of time, found itself wandering from the shore of its inception, a pilgrim on a journey it did not recognize. In this modern epoch, a world awakening to itself, there stirs a yearning to cast off the shadows of doctrine piled high through centuries, to peer into the heart of the faith as it was known in its nascence. The old ways, held tight by those anchored in tradition, may yet fade into obscurity beneath the swell of this awakening tide.\n\nIn the hearts of believers, a profound historical consciousness will awaken, a longing to sift through the layers accreted over time, to reach the bedrock of the words spoken by the man from Galilee. It is a slow dawning, this return to the beginning, like the inexorable turn of the heavens. A movement will rise, shedding the vestiges of doctrine as a serpent sheds its skin, revealing beneath the simplicity of a truth once spoken plain. As this current flows through the lands of America and Europe, it shall gather its own, calling them to worship as in those ancient days, wherein the teachings of Jesus alone shall guide them. The institution of the church will endure, a lighthouse to navigate these strange waters, but the vast tapestry of belief shall weave itself into a singular thread, drawing the disparate strands of Christendom into a unified whole.\n\nHistory holds its reversions close, and in its annals are tales of empires that once despised the cross, now bearing it high. There was a time when the Roman Empire itself turned from persecutor to patron, and likewise has this land seen its own reversals, from the chains of slavery to the halls of leadership. The coming reversion shall be played out upon the stage of faith, unraveling the skein of history in pursuit of its source, and in this unraveling, diversity shall yield to unity. It is a journey made possible by the reading of the Nazarene’s words not as ironclad decree, but as parable, as metaphor to guide the soul.\n\nTo understand this path, one must trace it to the wellsprings of belief, to the days when only the faith of Abraham held sway. The roots of monotheism, the divine whisperings of revelation, and the authority of the ancient scriptures bound the people as they stood beneath the Roman yoke in days long past. Yet even then, the people were not of one spirit, divided as they were into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who tilled the land and kept the faith in their hearts.",
            "In the heart of The Jungle, there lies a truth as grim as the soot that clings to the factory walls. The nature of men, Sinclair shows us, is a thing of hunger and want, driven by a greed that knows no bottom, a self-centeredness that casts no shadow but its own. They seek only to elevate themselves, to carve out a piece of the world where they might reign unchallenged, giving no thought to those who toil beneath them. The great factories rise against the sky, their chimneys like the spires of some dark cathedral, belching smoke that trails away to the ends of the earth. The owners and managers, these sovereigns of soot, care little for the lives ground beneath the wheels of their ambition. The smoke, the filth, the ruin of both man and beast—these are the casualties of their progress, and they are blind to it all.\n\nSinclair pens a world where money is the only measure of worth, where loyalty and decency are ground down to dust beneath the relentless press of the dollar. The workers, mere cogs in this vast machine, are driven to their limits, cast aside without thought or recompense when their use has faded. In this era, the law is a ghost, offering no comfort, no justice to the laborers who sweat blood to line the pockets of their masters. The managers wield power like a lash, demanding ever more from their workers, who toil in conditions that would break a lesser soul. Sinclair does not need to speak it plainly; the truth hangs heavy in the air. The people of Packingtown, chained to their misery, have no recourse, no refuge. They are slaves in all but name, trapped in a cycle of exploitation from which there is no escape. The unions, those promised saviors, are but another cog in the wheel, thriving on the desperation of the very souls they claim to protect. And so, in this grim dance of power and poverty, Sinclair paints a portrait of a world where men are as brutal as the masters of old, and where the soil of human dignity is forever stained.",
            "In the realm of dreams where Edgar Allan Poe found solace, he crafted \"Dream-Land,\" a poem he held in high esteem among his works. Within its lines, the word \"Thulé\" appears, a relic traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. An island cast north of Britain, a terminus of the known world as the Greeks reckoned. And though Virgil’s hand etched it into history, another source, more contemporary, beckons for recognition. Poe's fascination with the Germanic writers of his time is no secret.\n\nThis reference bears weight, revealing Poe's acquaintance with Goethe’s prose. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" sheds light on the echoes between their verses, deducing an imitation of Goethe by Poe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature paints Goethe as a luminary, his \"Faust\" a poetic drama unfurled in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second at death's door in 1832. Nestled within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a monarch who, upon his queen's demise after gifting him a goblet, drowns in drink and sorrow. The king, in his twilight, bequeaths all save the goblet, his steps leading him to a cliff where he casts it into the sea, shuts his eyes against the world, and follows into oblivion. The kinship between Poe's king in \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's Thulian sovereign is undeniable, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe’s own losses and solace in drink. Faust too found its way into romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's own invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice does Thule emerge from Poe’s pen, a specter in his collected works. \"Ultima Thule\" finds mention in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" yet it bookends the stanzas of \"Dream-Land,\" binding them. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" echo each other, kindred spirits. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator speaks of Thule’s dark, solitary expanse, haunted by the specters of deceased companions, a world drained of color. Goethe’s king, bereaved of his queen, wanders that same shadowed realm, bereft of purpose or the will to reign. The poem unfolds as if the speaker wanders through Goethe’s lament.\n\nGoethe’s presence looms large, an author of significance whom Poe surely knew, if for nothing but his reverence for Tennyson. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's respect was clear, and through Tennyson, Poe’s exposure to Goethe was assured amidst the many renditions that followed Goethe’s original works.",
            "Beneath the indifferent sun of California law, could a soul, battered and broken upon the slick betrayal of an applesauce spill within the confines of a grocery store, lay claim to punitive reckoning by baring the malice of a manager who, twice warned of the peril, chose instead the company of his supper over the sanctity of the floor? A judge may well ponder before casting aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To conjure such a claim, a plaintiff must weave a tapestry of evidence, one that paints the defendant’s deeds in hues of willful disregard for the looming specter of harm, and moreover, that these deeds were steeped in despicable intent. Palmer, she can say that Martin, the manager, should have known the peril that brewed in that untouched spill, for others had fallen in those same aisles, in those same recent months, and with that knowledge, he chose yet to turn his back. Her claim of despicability, though perhaps not the strongest note in her lament, does carry weight, given the history of six such incidents in 2009, and Martin’s continued neglect to guard his domain.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a humble servant of D&D Markets, came to Martin, the manager, with word of the treacherous spill. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the warning with a wave and words that spoke of no time for trifles. A quarter-hour passed, and Mary J. Haddigan, another voice of caution, approached, only to be met with the same indifference. And so at half-past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate upon the applesauce, the floor rising up to meet her with a cold embrace, leaving her with a grievous wound in her back. Before her fall, five others had met with the unforgiving ground in that year alone. Now Palmer stands against D&D, seeking recompense and punishment for her suffering, as we ponder the merit of a motion to strike down her claim for punitive judgment.\n\nIn this land, a plaintiff may reach for punitive recompense in the breach of an obligation not bound by contract, should the defendant’s actions be forged in oppression, fraud, or malice. California Civil Code § 3294(a) speaks of malice as an act intended to wound, or lacking such intent, one must show deeds of despicable nature committed with eyes wide to the danger and yet willfully blind to the rights and safety of others. Courts have called actions malicious when they dance with disregard upon the rights of the plaintiff, when the defendant, aware of the peril their conduct births, steps forward with deliberate abandon. Such is the tale of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the dance of danger was laid bare.",
            "She had always felt a longing, an unyielding desire that could not be sated. It began when she was fourteen, just stepping into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still at seventeen. Over the years, she discerned that what she sought was not a thing but a person. Yet no boy stirred her heart. Some were drawn to her, stumbling through clumsy gestures to win the unwinable, but none captured her fancy. Often she pondered this enigma, searching for a cause to her strange detachment from the affairs of teenage girls. The years of reflection offered theories, but none sufficient to settle her speculation. And so she moved through life, ever questioning her own desires.\n\nA day at home was typically a tranquil affair. Her parents were gentle souls, calm in their ways, and disputes were a rarity. The only discord came from her insistence on independence, a spirited daughter of placid parents, her lively nature a counterpoint to their serene energy, endearing her to many for her warmth and amiability.\n\nBut today was not a day of peace. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some spark of inspiration, a cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice sharp and pained. She dashed to the source, fear mounting as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There lay her mother on the floor, grimacing with each labored breath, a repeated \"Ow\" escaping her lips. The daughter knelt beside her, reaching out with trembling hands to offer aid. \"Ouch... swee - ty, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words came hurried and strained, and the daughter saw the depth of her mother's agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how to help.\" Her mother gestured, and the daughter, grateful for the strength she had cultivated, hoisted her and bore her to the car, laying her gently in the back before driving with haste.\n\nThe hospital was a place of sterile scents and quiet dread, but she was too consumed by her mother's plight to notice. She carried the injured woman inside, her voice rising in urgency as she called for assistance. Concerned faces appeared, and a rolling bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. The doctors whisked her into care, leaving the daughter alone with her worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet, a simple misstep that had led them here.",
            "The study sought to lay bare that the faithful adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as it is known, might bear upon the heart in ways that the heart might be grateful for. There is talk of a score they call the alternate Mediterranean diet score, and it speaks to a lessened chance of the maladies of the heart and the blood. This diet is a thing of moderation, of green things and fruits and nuts and grains, and the sea’s bounty, and it is a diet that shuns the flesh of beasts and the fats that come from them. The spirits are not forbidden but are to be taken with a measure of wisdom.\n\nThe old studies spoke of the diet's power to ward off death, both from the heart and from life itself, and there was one that took men and women and showed how they were bettered by it more so than by the absence of fat alone. Yet none had turned their eye toward the stroke or the death by stroke.\n\nHere in this work, they followed the lives of women, thousands upon thousands of them, nurses all, from the places in this country where they toil. For years they were watched, their diets measured by their own hand in the telling of what they ate. And most did not falter from this task. Their afflictions were noted, the heart's struggles, the strokes, the deaths that followed. Where proof was absent, judgment was made by what was probable. They counted the weight of their bodies, the smoke of their breath, the medicines they took, and the life they lived outside of their work.\n\nIn the end, they sought to see the truth of the diet’s score and how it related to the heart and its failings, whether they led to death or not. And what they found was a thing of note. Those who held fast to the diet stood apart from those who did not. They walked a path less fraught with the troubles of the heart and the stroke. And the numbers they found told a tale clear and stark. Among the women who held the diet dear, the chance of such afflictions was lessened, the risk they bore was a shade lighter than those who did not.",
            "The sign held aloft reads, Hitler is alive in Burma. \n\nEllen Page, famed for her role in Juno, stands solitary on a corner, the cardboard placard raised above her in defiance. The message scratched out in ink, a testament to the times. Burma, or Myanmar as it is known, lies in the grip of a tyrannical junta. A power seized through a coup d’état in the year of our Lord nineteen sixty-two. Two thousand seven brought the rumblings of dissent, the first to stir in a decade. Monks clad in saffron robes led the way, their uprising named for the very color that adorned them. Saffron Revolution, they called it. At first, it was a peaceful clamor, the junta begrudgingly looked on. But peace is a fragile thing. Soon the violence swelled, an all-out war some called it, monks against the junta's might. Monasteries fell beneath the military's heel. Foreign eyes were silenced, journalists shackled or shot. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese chronicler of truth, fell on the twenty-seventh of September, slain for bearing witness. Officially, thirteen souls were lost, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, spoke of thousands more, uncounted by any ledger.\n\nSuch tales are not new to this world. The craving for power and control over one's kin stretches long as the history of man. Emperors of Rome claimed divine right to rule, to command every facet of life under heaven's gaze. In Japan, the emperors were gods incarnate, or so the tale goes, leading their people with cell phones and ritual suicide. Our own President, George W. Bush, finds counsel with Ted Haggard, shepherd of the simple, a jesting arm of the Republic's hold.\n\nThere are incidents well remembered, the protest in Tiananmen Square, June fourth, nineteen eighty-nine. Intellectuals, workers, and the young stood against the iron hand of governance. The count of the dead is a thing of mystery, the Chinese state claiming hundreds, while whispers from the Red Cross speak of thousands. And Rwanda, in the nineties, where Hutu blades and bullets sought the Tutsi, a genocide driven by the hand of government. The Third Reich, a dark chapter written across Europe, where Jews were hunted and slain, a grim testament to man's capacity for cruelty.",
            "In the world of jazz where the shadows fall long and the nights stretch deep, Duke Ellington stands as a testament to time, a figure whose music whispers the tales of an era. His life spans the epochs of jazz, shaping an orchestra like a sculptor working marble, each note a chisel strike. The piano was his quiet companion, present yet unobtrusive in the symphonies of sound he conjured. As a composer, Ellington wove tapestries of melody and harmony, each thread a testament to the talents of his band. He built spaces where the music breathed, where soloists could wander and improvise, yet he penned orchestrations so tight they sang with the voices of the men who played them. In this, he was more than a composer; he was an architect of sound, crafting the very soul of the orchestra, each piece a testament to originality and coherence.\n\nThe pages of the Grove Music dictionary speak of Ellington’s innovation, calling upon the memory of \"Creole Love Call,\" wherein the voice itself becomes an instrument, a whisper of the divine. Here, the voice adds texture and color, unburdened by the weight of words. It is an early glimpse into his genius, the ability to weave the voice with the style of his soloists. In the slow drawl of twelve-bar blues, the piece unfolds in six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: The voice dances with reeds, smooth then rough, a call and response like the wind caressing the leaves.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet takes the stage, unraveling the melody, blue notes hanging like ghosts in the night.\nChorus 3: The clarinet sweeps high, a bird's cry, supported by the piano's gentle syncopation.\nChorus 4: The full band returns, echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds locked in a conversation.\nChorus 5: A crescendo, reeds soaring, the brass and rhythm sections punctuating with syncopated stop time.\nChorus 6: Back to the beginning, but now the voice growls, an instrument in its own right.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, and the trombone’s dissonant end—a whisper of mystery. Ellington’s voice, a hue in the palette of his music, a signature that permeates all he touched.\n\nA year hence, in \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington marries orchestration with the color of tone. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat weave a tapestry, the voice and horn indistinguishable, a rich sound that echoes through the night. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds upon these foundations, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone a herald of melody, a mainstay in Ellington's kingdom of sound.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do is a murmur in the backwoods of science, a whisper among the trees. Are there unseen hands that guide the course of change, silent laws that bind the paths of life's unfolding? The old scholar D'Arcy Thompson, back in the year of 1917, spoke of the limits of our dreams, how the shapes of the simplest of creatures elude the tongues of numbers. Yet here we stand, no closer to the heart of that mystery. In recent days, the minds have turned to numbers and equations to grasp the ways of mollusks, their shells spun from the thread of time across the ages. We work to unravel the dance of Prunum, to see how their forms are born and reborn, and what forces shape their journey from the past to the now. Through the lens of an X-ray, we capture their secrets, the curves and lines that tell their tale. These we feed into machines, in the manner of CerioShell, to conjure visions of shells that might have been, and might yet be. The fruits of these labors we weave with the hands of experiment and description, to glimpse the greater story of their kind.\n\nIn the mind’s eye, a shell is a corridor of time, a spiral staircase that winds through the vault of the heavens. Each turn, a whorl, encircles an axis unseen, the columella, the spine of the thing. The whorls grow in their own time, marked by sutures like the rings of old trees. The greatest of these, the body whorl, stands last among its fellows. The spire is all that came before, rising to its pinnacle, the apex, and falling to its base. The creature lives within, reaching out through its door, the aperture.\n\nWe gaze upon these shells from all angles—apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The common view, apertural, with the aperture facing you and the apex reaching skyward.\n\nCounting the whorls is a simple rite. Begin with the apical view, find the first suture's start. Draw a line asunder the shell, counting from this mark, quarter whorls as they go.\n\nImagine the shell as a series of doorways, traversing time and space as the creature builds its house. You may follow this path, mapping the journey of each whorl’s heart, the breadth and height of the aperture.\n\nThis path may be drawn upon paper or inscribed in the language of numbers. With these symbols, the story of the mollusk’s shell is written, and by their alteration, the tale may change.",
            "In that land stretched across the equator where the sun met the sea, the cries of newborns had not changed much in ten long years. Indonesia, with its archipelago of islands and dreams, found itself on the road to meet the world's grand visions, those Millennium goals. Yet, for the mothers and their children, the road was long and fraught with shadows. The water was cleaner, the latrines dug, but the health of the young and the bearing women lagged behind, like ships in a calm sea, missing the wind to carry them forth to the year fifteen of the new century.\n\nThe tale of healers attending births was one of numbers that shone but with a dim light. Seventy-two in a hundred births now saw a skilled hand, but many were still the hands of tradition, the midwives who could not mend what went awry. And so, the blood flowed and lives ebbed with it, the truth of numbers laid bare. The healing of the young, too, fell short as fewer children were brought to the healers when sickness struck. The records of care after birth were but whispers, incomplete and worrying, a story untold but known.\n\nIn the cities, the knife of the surgeon came to bear upon seven in a hundred mothers, but in the countryside, only two. The chasm between the town and the field was vast, like the gap between the rich man's house and the poor man's shack, where a quarter again and some more could not find a healer at all. The cost was counted in coins and lives.\n\nThe question that lingered in the air was how to mend what was broken. Should the land craft new ways, specific and clear, or should it weave a stronger cloth for all, where mothers and children found care before and after the birthing? The allure of quick fixes was strong, a temptation like the siren's call, but the wisdom of the land cautioned against it. To pour all into one cup left others dry, and healers would gather where the gold shone brightest, leaving the rest to wither. The tale of the world’s fight against the plague of AIDS was told, and the lesson of family planning left behind was learned. To run many races at once was to tire and falter, the weight of forms and ledgers heavy on the mind and hand.\n\nAnd so, the path lay open, a choice between the quick and the lasting, the easy and the just. The land would choose, as it had always done, with the wisdom of its elders and the hope of its young.",
            "In the vast sprawl of time, popular music has unfurled itself like an unending tapestry, its threads woven into so many genres that to enumerate them all is a task of futility. Such is the nature of things, for from the root of each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, to name but a few—sprout myriad offshoots, each branching into its own sub and sub-sub genres, a fractal of sound and thought. Among these, heavy metal stands as a testament to the wild diversity and raw expressiveness of popular music over these past forty years. It is a genre of emotion, stark and unyielding, often dwelling in the shadowed corners of the heart. Diverse too, for the genre, almost from its inception, revealed itself pliable, a clay for the sculptor's hand, birthing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres in an ever-expanding lineage that persists to this day.\n\nAnd now, in this age, heavy metal has become a labyrinthine creature of many faces. It is a confluence of themes borrowed from other musical realms, yet it is not without origin. To comprehend the metal that pervades the airwaves now, one must gaze into the heart of the metal movement itself, understanding it as a force, a revolution rather than merely a sound.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement shaped by the darkness. It is a music of excess—more bass, more volume, more ferocity, more drama. It eschews simplicity in favor of skill; those who wield its instruments do so with masterful hands, their prowess evident in each note. Unsurprisingly, it is a movement steeped in the haze of drugs, the psychedelic tempest of the mid-seventies having driven artists to the edge of sanity, birthing records that seemed not of this world, their madness attributed to the substances that fueled them. Its qualities are dark, visceral, a stark contrast to the brighter hues of popular music that came before. Later generations of metal drew from the Romantic era's somber depths, echoing its darkness and intensity in their own creation. The lyrical darkness, as expressed by Byrne, is a cornerstone of this movement.\n\nConsider the song Helter Skelter, a glimpse into the darker psyche of the Beatles. It is a sonic rollercoaster, its undulating rhythm a nod to the chaos of drug-fueled perception. This track is oft hailed as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, a retort to the weighty, shadowy tones of a Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, in their ambition, sought to prove their mettle, planting this song like a flag upon The White Album's expansive terrain.",
            "In the years before the Surrealists laid down their dreams in paint, Henri Rousseau, a man given to his own visions, conjured dreams both in the flesh and in the mind. The Dream, a canvas birthed in 1910 by Rousseau's own hands, whispers not only of a woman transfixed amidst the wild wonders of her slumber but also of Rousseau's own aspirations. He yearned, from the first stroke of his brush, for the acknowledgment of those who tread the hallowed halls of art; for the embrace of the world he adored from afar. It was an arduous path he walked, torn between the decision to echo the masters and thus gain entry into their circle, or to wander a solitary road, painting as the muse willed, unshackled.\n\nTo understand this struggle woven into The Dream, one must peer into Rousseau's own tale. Born in the spring of 1844, in the modest town of Laval, northwestern France, he was the son of a tinsmith whose trade brought modest comfort. Rousseau's education was not in the arts, but in the mundane service of tolls and tariffs, until the age of forty, when fate's cruel hand left him bereft of his beloved Clémence and all but one of their children. It was grief that led him to the canvas, seeking solace and rebirth in the pigments and the brush, a refuge from the world’s harshness. Unlike his peers, who painted the peasant with romantic eyes, Rousseau painted with the sincerity of one who knew the common lot of man.\n\nThe yearning Rousseau felt for acceptance among the art world's elite is a longing that can be understood in the scope of his life. An outsider, self-taught, entering the arena of art at an age when many are well settled into their craft, he labored alongside giants whose names echoed through the salons. It was only as the likes of Matisse began to ascend that Rousseau's own star flickered into notice. In the pages of Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of these two men, not as rivals, but as travelers on different paths. Matisse, wary of the familiar, sought to avoid the trite, while Rousseau, in his heart, wished only for a place among the accepted, to paint with such convention that he might secure his seat at the table of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the vast expanse of human thought, many a thinker has pondered the kinship between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. There lies, I reckon, a reason deep in the marrow of existence for this bond. As Keats mused in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are entwined, inseparable. Much of what we glean from life comes through the hard school of experience or the guiding hand of education. Yet, there is a curious appreciation for ethics and aesthetics that needs no such tutelage. They exist as if waiting to be discovered, not instructed. In their essence, they seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our reckonings with morality and beauty are endeavors to understand why a painting or a tale is beautiful or why an act is moral, not a ledger of rules to craft such things.\n\nIn the realm of critique, words fall short of capturing the true essence of what is good or beautiful. Take da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance. Discussions may swirl around its composition or the mysteries it holds, but these fail to truly explain its greatness. When asked about a beloved work of art or literature, folks often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into the why of it all. Art and morals elude complete reduction to mere descriptors of their traits. As Flannery O'Connor put it, stories say what cannot be said otherwise; they speak truths beyond the reach of mere statements. No matter how we dissect a literary work, a fragment remains, transcendent and untouched. Ethics shares this ineffable quality. Wittgenstein tells us ethics cannot be expressed, for it is transcendental. This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the shared power of art and morality, binding them together in their timeless dance.\n\nFor morality and art are bound by their profound impact on us at a level that defies explanation. They speak to us in a language beyond words, touching the very core of our being. This bond is perhaps strongest in the realm of literature. As McKean observed, what sets literature apart from other arts is its moral essence. While moral standards might find no place in music or the like, they are as integral to literature as they are to life itself. To live is to navigate values, and literature resonates with us because of the values it reveals.",
            "The land now known as Germany stands as a formidable force, a realm woven with a tapestry of culture stretching from the shadowed alps of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This same spirit breathes through Köln by the Rhine, across the heartlands to the Saxon bastion of Dresden upon the Elbe. It is a land of many sources, birthed from the bones of tribes long past.  \n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, whispers its origins in the halls of scholars and the minds of historians. Tacitus spoke of a tribe, the Tungrians, who bore the name before it crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaul. Julius Caesar, in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, spoke of the Germans as those beyond the reach of Rome, a word borrowed from the Gauls to mark the boundary of conquest. The roots of the name are tangled and uncertain, some say it spoke of spears or the noise of battle, others of neighbors in a tongue long forgotten.  \n\nTacitus, that old chronicler, wrote of these people in his ancient tome, declaring them pure and unmingled with the world beyond. He pondered who would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa for the cold embrace of Germania, a land wild and unyielding, save for those whose hearts called it home.  \n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent forth their legions to the edge of Germania in search of spoils, yet often returned to the heart of their empire. The Germanic tribes stood at the fringes, trading their goods and their strength, serving in the legions of Rome, a quiet presence on the edge of the world.",
            "In the shadowy world of Twelfth Night, disguise weaves its crooked paths through hearts and minds, a tool as potent for deception as a serpent's bite. Yet, like all masks, it wears thin, and there comes a time when a soul must shed the borrowed skin or risk becoming a ghost of its own self. To peel away such layers can leave a person stranded, adrift from those they once held dear. The heart must choose between the essence of one's being and the fragile threads of connection, for though some may shrug off the trickery, others may find their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nIn the twisted dance of gender's guise, the stakes rise higher, for it stirs the question of why one would shun their face to don another's form. Viola steps into this masquerade, a shield against the perils of a strange land: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In her guise, she finds sanctuary, yet the cost is a severance from the sisterhood of women, a solitude deepened by Olivia's love, misled by the twin faces of Viola and Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Caught in this web, Viola must wrestle with the silent longing that stirs between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn the eyes of today, Twelfth Night reveals how disguise can unearth the truths buried beneath propriety's surface, drawing out desires unspoken. Olivia and Orsino find themselves entangled in emotions that Viola's presence ignites. Does Olivia's heart beat for Cesario as a man, or does she yearn unawares for the woman beneath? The swift turn of her affections to Sebastian suggests a parody of those who judge by appearance alone, as Olivia declares the bond of kinship over passion: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the play unfolds, a mirror to the complexities of the human heart, where deception lays bare the truths we dare not speak.",
            "The tales of German colonial rule are etched deep with the ink of brutality, a specter that looms large over the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in the land then known as German South West Africa. Yet to paint the expanse of a colonial empire with but a single brush would be folly. The German dominion, a mosaic of lands and peoples, bore witness to a tapestry of governance as diverse as the landscapes it encompassed. The promise and reality of education followed suit.\n\nWhen the British set foot upon the remnants of German East Africa, which the world now knows as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they found among the people a surprising bloom of literacy and learning. It was a testament to German endeavors in the realm of education, which some chroniclers of the time did not hesitate to commend, not just in Tanganyika but in the distant reaches of Kamerun and beyond.\n\nYet in the lands of South West Africa, a harsher tale unfolded. Unlike their counterparts in the east, where the state's hand had shaped schools and guided the minds of the youth, here the education of the native was left to the fervor of missionary zeal, scantily aided by the government’s coffers. Indeed, the government reserved its resources for the education of Europeans, crafting schools of the state and casting a tighter rein on the mission schools that did exist. This divergence in policy left its mark long after the German banner was lowered. While other colonies could boast of learned natives, South West Africa remained largely a land of shadows, untouched by the light of education, its people unlettered and silent.\n\nThe reasons for this divergence are manifold, a knot of social, political, and economic threads. This discourse seeks to unravel these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and the powers that once claimed dominion over these lands. The chronicles of education in the German empire are numerous, penned mostly in the tongue of the empire itself, during or soon after its time of rule. At first, these works endeavored merely to sketch the contours of educational systems. But with time, writings in English broadened the horizon through comparative studies and deeper examinations of specific educational facets. These studies laid bare the stark differences that lay between the colonies.\n\nThe most notable work, Cohen’s study, delves into the heart of this paper’s inquiry, drawing comparisons between the systems that took root in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen argues that the settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the educational landscape of the colony.\n\nSouth West Africa, by the grace of its temperate climes and despite the desert's embrace, attracted a European populace larger than most of Germany’s other distant possessions. In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites called it home, outnumbering those in East Africa, the next closest in settler count, where just over five thousand souls lived under the German sun.",
            "The tale of two nations, the United States and Mexico, is one marked by a rivalry that spanned the years like a shadow cast long upon the land. It was a saga that stretched from the year of our Lord 1836 unto 1893, a span of fifty-seven years filled with strife and discord. The apex of this enmity was the war they called the Mexican-American War, fought between the years 1846 and 1848, where the United States, in its relentless march, did lay claim to the lands of Texas and the American Southwest, wresting them from the grasp of Mexico. Battles and skirmishes flared between these nations, a conflagration that found its peace only as the world edged toward the Great War. The roots of this contention lay deep in the soil of ideological and cultural divide, a clash of gods and traditions, a collision of material desires (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThus it is, that nations bordering one another are often locked in such rivalries, their contiguous lands breeding grounds for discord. The United States and Mexico are but one stone in the mosaic of border-bound enmities. David M. Pletcher (1977) spoke of it thus: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). While other Latin nations found a more amiable path with the United States, these two stood apart, their histories entwined with rivalry.\n\nReligious strife cast its shadow too, a specter that haunted this relationship as it has many others throughout the annals of history. Sally Frahm (2001) opined that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological battle was not one of political systems but of the very gods they worshipped, a legacy of distrust bequeathed from the English and Spanish colonial pasts, a barrier to any semblance of peace between these two great nations.\n\nIn the chronicles of Diehl and Goerts (2000), seventeen disputes are recorded in this period of rivalry. Most were territorial, born of border raids and frontier woes, the land itself a tinderbox ready to ignite. Bandits and outlaws plagued the borderlands until the day came when both nations resolved to impose their martial might upon these lawless expanses (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAnd so, the rivalry waned as Mexico found itself in thrall to the United States, dependent in ways both subtle and overt (Schmitt 1974 p. 109). As the century drew to its close, the ambitions of America shifted from the conquest of land to the dominion of economic sway over its southern neighbor (p. 110). Thus did a chapter close, not with a clash of arms but with the quiet conquest of commerce.",
            "Fifteen years past and without warning I found myself cast adrift by an ailment unknown to me, a shadow slipping silently into my life. Once, I wore the white of a nurse, my hands steady and sure, a choice born of a need as deep as the roots of an old tree, seeking the safety and certainty denied me in younger years. The refrain that echoed through my youth was this: work awaits where the sick line the halls, an endless procession of need. And so, though my heart leaned toward the path of science and the pen of a journalist, I chose the care of the infirm.\n\nYet there I stood, age forty-six, solitary and with pockets near empty, robbed of the work that had defined me. Disabled still, fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security’s meager sustenance has left me hollow, nothing of possession to claim as mine. Each dawn breaks upon a struggle anew, an unyielding test of my security and the fragile remnants of esteem. Certainty has fled my life, save for this one truth: I owe my survival not to my own strength, which falters beneath true calamity, but to the steadfast arms of kin and a few loyal companions.\n\nLife’s emergencies, vast and minute, are the only certainty, for no preparation can steel one against every storm. The nation’s reliance on the crumbling edifice of government aid has grown weary and frail, yet there lies a greater wisdom in rekindling trust among neighbors, in learning again the art of giving and receiving aid rather than each soul retreating to solitary defenses.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, the supposed backbone of this land, belies a deeper truth. Our ancestors, those who braved the great mountains in their wagons, leaned not on singular strength but on the bonds of compassion and shared sustenance. Alone, they would have perished.\n\nSo, prepare as you must. I have done so myself. A kit for disaster, the means to purify water, and the tools to seal windows against unseen threats. My shelves hold candles, matches sealed against the wet, and cans enough to stave off hunger. If you have the land and know-how, let your hands grow sustenance from the soil. But in all your preparations, do not forget the faces next door. Know your neighbors, for in their eyes lies the strength none of us possess alone.",
            "In a time long past, in the shadows of antiquity, a prince was born into the world who would come to be known as Buddha. His life was a journey away from the clamor of worldly desires toward a serene enlightenment, and from his teachings sprouted the roots of Buddhism, the most ancient branch of which bears the name Theravada. This faith, enduring through the passage of twenty-five centuries, has morphed as the years have worn on, its visage altered since the days when the Buddha himself walked the earth. One might see this in the land of Sri Lanka, where the people keep the water-cutting ceremony, a rite unmentioned by the Buddha yet heavy with significance for monks and laymen alike. These changes weave through the fabric of the faith, from its outward traditions to the very marrow of its doctrinal beliefs. The Theravada community, both cloistered in monastic life and in the world of the laity, has been shaped and reshaped by forces from within and without, both kind and cruel.\n\nThis tale requires understanding of certain terms that will surface again and again. Internal versus external, we say. Internal, born of those within the Buddhasasana, no matter their robes or lack thereof. External, from those who walk other paths. Hostile, those forces that wound or wish harm upon the Buddhist fold. Benign, indifferent forces, neither wishing to aid nor injure, though they may do either unbidden. These shall be the guideposts in this telling.\n\nFirst we must peer into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, to the doctrines that form its core. The Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the sacred law, contained within the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka holds the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the philosophical depths. Herein lie truths like Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering that clings to life; and Anicca, the fleeting nature of all things. Through these truths, one may break the chains of Sansara, the relentless cycle of death and rebirth. With Sansara shattered, desire, hatred, and delusion shall also fade, and enlightenment may be grasped. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law for living: for the layman, five precepts to guide the soul; for the monk, a myriad more. But at the very heart lies the four noble truths. First, that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is its cause. Third, that the chains of suffering can be broken."
