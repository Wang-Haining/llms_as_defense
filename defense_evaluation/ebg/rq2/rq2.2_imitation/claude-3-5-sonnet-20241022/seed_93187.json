            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The logic winds tight as a snare, but catches nothing substantial. Faith, they call it in their books and temples. Faith like a flame in darkness.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He believed God could be proven like a theorem, laid bare under the knife of reason until the truth bled out clear as morning.

He would take words that had no business laying together and force them into an unholy union, creating something new and terrible and beautiful.

Government men had lists of creatures they said needed saving, butterflies and birds with names like gnatcatcher, though who had ever caught gnats was another question entirely.\n\nThe old man said it would take more work than the regular way of farming, fighting the weeds and the bugs without poison, watching the crops die sometimes when there wasnt nothing you could do about it. But there was help to be had if you knew where to look, money from men in offices who'd never worked the land themselves but who'd decided how it ought to be worked all the same. The old man knew a place nearby that was making it work, organic they called it, though it was just farming the way his grandaddy would have known it. Said maybe that was the future, though it looked an awful lot like the past.",
            "There's a thing between brothers that ain't natural and ain't made by man. It's older than blood and deeper than bone. It carries love and pride and mean things too, things that have no name but live in the dark spaces between heartbeats. Brothers know each other like they know their own face in still water, seeing themselves in the other's eyes like some terrible mirror that shows truth instead of reflection.\n\nWhen the world turns wrong and everything goes black as pitch, that's when you see what kind of bond holds. Good or evil, it don't matter. It just is. And whatever comes of it carries a price that must be paid in full. No credit given, no promises accepted. Just cold payment in whatever coin the world demands.\n\nIn the story they call The Scarlet Ibis there's these two brothers walking through a world green and wet and full of things dying. The older one, he's got pride eating at him like rust on iron, and the younger one, Doodle, he's born wrong, fragile as a bird's bones. They set out on a fool's errand through swamps where old women's ghosts still walk, and only one comes back breathing.\n\nThe older brother, he wanted what couldn't be had. Wanted to teach running and climbing and all manner of things to a boy whose heart was weak as water. Wanted someone to race through the pinewoods to Horsehead Landing, wanted someone to sit high in the trees where the wind lives. But you can't make a racing horse from a broken-legged colt, and he knew it. The knowing ate at him worse than the wanting.\n\nThere was a time he looked at that baby brother and thought about sending him to Jesus with a pillow. Thought about it like a man thinks about killing a wounded animal. But the baby smiled and something in that smile reached down into whatever dark place that killing thought came from and pulled out something like love instead. Even if he didn't know it was love at the time. Even if he wouldn't know it until it was too late.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and twisted thing, a labyrinth of flesh and electricity that moves like God's own clockwork through the skull. In the old days they said it was like wax that could be marked upon, then paper, then books bound in leather, and now they speak of machines that think in ones and zeros, but all these things are just shadows on a wall, poor reflections of the truth that lies beneath.\n\nThe world comes in through gates of flesh. Light and sound and heat, all of them transformed into something else, something that runs like lightning through the corridors of the brain. They called it processing, as if the mind was some kind of slaughterhouse for reality. The signals move up and down like spirits in a house, bottom to top and top to bottom. Take a black box sitting on white. The eye sees edges first, boundaries where darkness meets light, and the mind builds it up piece by piece like a carpenter working in reverse. Then from above comes knowledge, memory, expectation. The box becomes more than shapes. It becomes real.\n\nThere's a guardian in there too, watching, deciding what matters and what don't. You might be standing in grass up to your ankles but your mind won't count each blade unless it has to. But hear your name spoke across a crowded room and something in you turns like a wolf hearing prey in the distance.\n\nThe mind keeps its treasures like a crow keeps bright things, storing them away in different nests. Some memories last only moments, like smoke in the wind. Others stick around for maybe twenty seconds, running in circles like a dog chasing its tail through the neural paths. And some, the ones that really matter, they get carved into the very meat of you, written in proteins like scripture in stone.\n\nThey tried to map it all out, these men of science with their theories and their models. They drew pictures of it like a web, with every thought connected to every other thought by strings of meaning. Chair to table, table to wood, wood to tree, tree to forest, forest to darkness. All of it linked together in a great network that stretches through the skull like stars in the night sky, each one burning with its own fierce light.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets fell and with them fell the dreams and hopes and futures of countless souls who had staked their claims on promises writ in sand. The unemployment came like a thief in the night and the houses stood empty like the skulls of dead things in the desert and the great corporations that had stood like giants astride the nation lay broken and bleeding in the dust.\n\nThe seeds of this darkness were planted in older times. In the Clinton years when men dreamed of power eternal and sought to buy the hearts of the masses with promises of homes they could not afford. They rewrote the ancient laws of lending like false prophets rewriting scripture and the banks genuflected before the altar of profit and risk. Fannie Mae and its twisted sister Freddie Mac packaged these poisoned promises and sold them like snakeoil across the land.\n\nThe mortgages were crafted by men who dealt in shadows and complexity. They fashioned instruments of debt more byzantine than the labyrinths of old, weaving together the fates of millions in webs of paper and promise. CDOs they called them, and CMOs, and a hundred other names in a tongue that spoke only of greed. The people leveraged their futures against dreams and the dreams turned to nightmares when the bubble burst like a boil upon the face of the nation.\n\nWhen the reckoning came it came with the swift terrible justice of an Old Testament God. The great houses of finance tottered and fell. Bear Stearns. Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers. Their names now whispered like the names of dead kings. Four trillion in debt hung like a millstone around their necks. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were transformed, made to wear the chains of regulation like penitents. Fannie and Freddie, those twin towers of hubris, fell into the arms of the government like prodigal children seeking sanctuary. September 2008. The month when the old world died and the new world was born in blood and bankruptcy.",
            "The words lay there like bones bleached white in desert sun. Exposition. A word that carries weight like a coffin carried by pallbearers who dont know the dead. Writers take to it like vultures to carrion, thinking their prose will sing but finding instead it croaks deep in the throat of the reader who holds no patience for such things.\n\nThe old doctor would curse at the screen when she found herself trapped in passages thick with detail that served no purpose save to fill space with words. Words that carried no blood in them. No life. Just dead things arranged in rows like headstones in an abandoned graveyard.\n\nShow dont tell. The writers commandment carved in stone but broken daily like any other holy decree. The devil that whispers to put down the history first sits on one shoulder while its twin perches on the other urging every detail of every life be spelled out in full. Neither devil speaks truth.\n\nTo tell a thing is to kill it. When a man speaks to camera explaining how things came to be its already too late. The story has died in his mouth before the words take flight. In books the writer becomes that man, that teller of dead tales.\n\nConsider the woman who lost her man. You could say they met and married and he died. Three things that happened like three bullets fired into the night. But that aint the truth of it. The truth lives in how his hands moved when he spoke to her that first time. How the rain fell the day they wed. How his blood looked black as oil in the moonlight when they put him down. These things carry the weight of truth. The rest is just wind passing through empty rooms.\n\nA writer must give meat to these bones but most times they rush past like coyotes with fresh kill, dropping pieces of the truth as they run. They got a man who worked nights at a gas station, former Air Force, twice married and childless, who likes to fish and dreams of owning that station someday. They think knowing he ate eggs benedict that morning matters. It dont. What matters is how he holds his coffee cup like it might break. How he stares out into the dark thinking about things that cant be changed. That's where the story lives.",
            "The morning brought news like carrion birds circling. First came word from Ashley, a town small and godless, where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife. His face in the jailhouse photo bore the hollow eyes of something ancient and terrible. The story passed quick as summer lightning, leaving only the echo of steel meeting flesh.\n\nThen came word of the boy Buyers, eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods. The streets there run dark with old sins, and the SWAT men moved through them like black-clad pilgrims seeking redemption that wouldn't come. The news gave it scarce attention, like they always did when dark skin met darker fate. White flesh makes better stories, they reckon, though death makes no such distinction.\n\nA bullet had found the Med-Flight bird, a .22 singing through metal skin. Five thousand dollars to name the shooter, though money rarely loosens true tongues. The weather woman spoke of rain coming, her words a incantation against the heat that held the city in its grip. Mid-eighties, she said, like numbers could capture the weight of August air.\n\nThey told of a UDF store on Clime Road, robbed by a man they described like reading scripture - dark-skinned, hooded, tall and lean as a desert coyote. They lingered on his blackness like preachers on sin. Then came the tale of Rodriguez, the Texas man who'd sent green poison north. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if breaking time into smaller pieces might make the sentence weigh more heavy. They named him Hispanic, though the drugs he moved cared nothing for the blood of those who carried them.\n\nAll these stories floating like ash in morning light, each one carrying its own kind of darkness, its own particular damnation.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like a shadow across the financial plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets like some dark harbinger of wealth. It trades like any stock would trade but carries within it multitudes, like some great beast containing smaller beasts, all of them moving in concert across the electronic wilderness of the exchange.\n\nThe thing about an ETF is it gives a man what he needs. Diversification. The ability to sell short when the darkness comes. Margin buying when opportunity presents itself. A man can buy one share or a thousand and the transaction cares not which. The costs they keep low, lower than them mutual funds that promise the same things but deliver less. But there aint nothing in this world comes without its price and the commissions you pay like death taking its due.\n\nThe variety of these funds stretches far as the eye can see but a man must look careful at what they promise. Diversification they say. Benefits they claim. But the wise know that promises need testing against the hard light of day.\n\nWe set our eyes on one called IHF, studying it like a tracker would study spoor in the desert sand. Comparing it against its ten largest holdings like comparing a wolf to the pack that made it. We aimed to know if owning the one was better than owning the ten separate, and if there might be some better way to arrange these pieces into something that would yield more bounty.\n\nThe task of examining every holding would be like counting every grain of sand in the Mojave so we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of what the thing held within its borders. These ten we listed out with their percentages like counting coup.\n\nTo know how these ten represented the whole we did the calculations, cold and merciless as winter arithmetic. We normalized them to hundred percent, figured their contribution to Beta and Return like some financial alchemist seeking truth in numbers. The results we laid out in charts black and stark as cemetery markers.\n\nWhat the numbers told was this: them ten holdings alone would yield 6.11 percent more than the ETF itself, like finding extra water in what you thought was a dry well. The Beta ran lower too, by point twelve. But numbers can lie like any man can lie and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just shadows cast by statistical moonlight.",
            "The numbers told a story and it wasnt a good one. They fell like dead leaves in that third month, scattered and forgotten on the cold New England ground. Winter had come as it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned like metal skeletons against the brick walls. The footprints in the snow grew fewer. The people who once walked now drove their machines, sealed against the wind and ice like pilgrims in iron churches.\n\nDecember brought its own peculiar madness. The scholars bent over their books and the teachers over their marks and the logging of journeys became a thing of ghosts and memories. Then the holidays came and the campus emptied like a dead town in some forsaken territory, wind whistling through the empty corridors where once there were footsteps.\n\nThey came back in January but the numbers stayed low, a fact that could not be explained away by the cold or the snow or the dark mornings that made men seek the comfort of their automobiles. February was worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash. We tried to rekindle it with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flaring that brought some warmth back to the numbers.\n\nThe truth was simpler and harder both. The machine had become like a second skin to these people, a carapace of steel and glass that spoke to something deeper than convenience. It was freedom itself, hammered into shape in Detroit and Tokyo, freedom that had seeped into the blood and bones of a nation. We fought it with trinkets - paper promises for coffee and books and food. But perhaps we should have fought steel with steel, tempted them with better machines - bicycles wrought fine as spiderwebs, automobiles that ran on lightning instead of dead dinosaurs. Maybe then the numbers would have told a different story. Maybe then the parking lots wouldn't have swallowed up the earth like tar pits, waiting to fossilize our good intentions.",
            "They were fifteen of them. Edison's trick films. Made in them years between 1895 and 1901 and stored now in that great repository of memory called the Library of Congress. Films that dealt in illusions and deceptions, wrought from the manipulation of the captured light itself. Most followed a strict catechism of rules, like ancient rites passed down through generations of showmen, though some dared venture beyond these bounds.\n\nThe films lived within wooden boxes, confined like prisoners to their proscenium frames. No movement of the eye that captured them, just the stark geometry of the stage inherited from those tattered vaudeville halls where magicians once plied their trade. The figures moved like specters across the frame, east to west, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In one such phantom play called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in that last year before the century turned, the players moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal rails, disappearing into the void beyond the frame's edge while the camera stood witness, immobile as stone.\n\nThese were pictures made at distance. No intimate portraits here. The camera kept its respectful remove like a mourner at a funeral, showing all and revealing nothing. Close-up shots were forbidden fruit in these early days, when the medium still wore its theatrical chains. The players kept to their appointed grounds, neither advancing nor retreating, trapped in that middle distance like souls in purgatory.\n\nTime itself was compressed in these reels. One shot, one film, that was the law. A minute or less of light and shadow, captured at varying speeds as if time itself was uncertain. They were simple things, these tricks. Disappearances, transformations, the stuff of carnival shows. But look closer at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, that grim spectacle from 1895. Watch how the illusion fractures if you study it hard enough, the moment when Mary's head becomes no more than a prop, though the eye wants to see it whole. That's the true trick of it. Not in the making but in the believing.",
            "In the dark hollows of literary history there lies what men call the Gothic Novel, a thing both ancient and new, like some terrible creature born of time itself. Ian Watt spoke of it as an oxymoron, this old-new thing, but words are wind and definitions are the chains men forge to bind what cannot be bound. The Gothic rides through our consciousness like a midnight rider, praised and damned in equal measure, called shallow by some and sublime by others who spoke of terror like Burke did, as if terror could be contained in words alone.\n\nIt began with Walpole and his Castle of Otranto, that first dark seed planted in the garden of letters. He took the ancient ways and the modern paths and wed them together like some unholy union, birthing what he named A Gothic Story. The gothic ways ran deep in it like roots in black earth - medieval theatre, stone arches pointing to heaven, traditions old as blood. Even then gothic meant many things to many men, like a word that had lost its way in time, wandering through centuries marked primitive by those who called themselves modern and enlightened.\n\nBut it was the marriage of these things - the theatrical gothic with its masks and its mysteries, and the novel with its way of peeling back the skull to see the thoughts beneath - that gave it life eternal. It became like some ageless thing, dead but not dying, new but not young, speaking across the vast desert of years to readers yet unborn.\n\nThe ghost of Chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that will not rest. In Otranto it lives and breathes, though changed from what it was in medieval times when knights rode forth in steel and honor. Walpole saw his world bereft of such things, saw politics and power strip bare the bones of honor until nothing remained but hollow men in hollow halls. He yearned for what was lost, for the idealized past that perhaps never was, but in that yearning he created something new.\n\nIn his character of Frederic we see this clearest, like looking through dark water to stones beneath. Before he steps onto the stage we know him by the marks of chivalry upon his soul - a prince who has known suffering, who has walked through fire and shadow, believed dead at the hands of infidels in some far land. Here stands the knight of old tales, but twisted, exaggerated, excessive like all things gothic must be, as if viewed through a glass that magnifies and distorts until the familiar becomes strange and the strange becomes familiar.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the minds of men who sought to move goods across vast spaces from maker to buyer through the raw materials and the making and the moving and all manner of commerce between. A consultant named Oliver had given it this name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. It was a process both simple and complex in its execution, like the weaving of a vast tapestry where each thread must find its place lest the whole thing come undone.\n\nSix elements existed in this chain and they were like the bones of some great beast: production and supply and inventory and location and transportation and information. Each one vital as blood, each one carrying its own weight in the grand scheme of things.\n\nProduction stood first among these elements, a foundation stone upon which all else was built. In the way of all things it began with want, with need, with desire. The managers would study the market like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what the people would buy and what they would not. They would make their decisions based on these auguries, choosing what would be made and where it would be made and how many would be made. Each decision carried weight, each choice echoing down through the chain like thunder across empty plains.\n\nHe had seen this himself in the great retail houses of Walmart and Target, where every action was prescribed and every movement calculated, down to the very clothes the workers wore and the way the trucks were emptied of their goods. It was a machinery vast and precise, and like all machinery it could fail if not tended proper.\n\nThen there was supply, that great decision of what would be done within the walls and what would be sent to others to do. They called it outsourcing when they sent the work away, seeking that thing they called velocity, though velocity was nothing more than the marriage of quality and flexibility with the eternal pursuit of lower costs. It was a dance of numbers and capabilities, of core competencies and strategic partnerships, all of it moving in a rhythm old as commerce itself.",
            "They came in the dark Victorian age like wraiths or phantoms stalking the halls of literature. Books of the aristocracy and their ways. Books of parlors and teacups and proper manners laid bare upon the page in infinite detail as if God himself had ordained their cataloguing. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from their kin like dark sheep in a pristine flock, carrying with them elements of mystery and the bizarre that no proper Victorian novel would dare embrace. These elements moved through the stories like smoke, seeping into the characters, making them more real somehow. More true.\n\n\"And now hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.\" That's what they wrote of Oliver. He walked between Sikes and Crackit who were not there but were there all the same, their voices real as gunsmoke in his ears. The boy stumbled through this fever dream while shots rang out and lights blazed across his vision like St. Elmo's fire and all the while pain rode him like a demon, constant and merciless.\n\nThese fever dreams and nightmares served as windows into souls. In Oliver's case they laid bare the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting came back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it came like a visitation, like judgment. He was there again. The pistol. The flash. The darkness. Some unseen hand bearing him away while Sikes and Crackit argued in his head like specters at a hanging. The pain was everywhere and nowhere. It had become like breathing. Like existing. The boy was powerless in this world of men and monsters, his will counted for nothing, and old Fagin's poison had already begun to work its way into his blood, into his bones, into whatever remained of hope.\n\nThe day that wasnt a day passed and night came again. Long night. Short night. Silent as death and gone in an instant.",
            "In them days I worked with the children after their schooling was done, them small faces bent over books and papers in the failing light. English and reading was what I knew best and that's what I done. There was this boy named Adrian, might've been nine or ten years old, struggling with his letters like a blind man counting coins. Something wasnt right with how he read. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs carved in stone by ancient peoples long dead.\n\nThe boy was Mexican sure enough but spoke English pure as any native born. We went on like that for a time until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some expedition. She stood there in her clean work clothes speaking no English at all, just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read right enough but the English letters was foreign to him, like tracks in the desert that dont match no animal you know.\n\nI tell this tale not just to speak on the wall between languages in our schools out here in California but to show how the obvious aint always obvious at all. Even a child speaking perfect English might find reading it like crossing a river in flood. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him them letters and sounds till they was familiar as his own face in the mirror. But for them children who barely speak English at all, that's a harder path to walk.\n\nAin't no single answer neither. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in using all of them together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching is good for all children, not just them that speak Spanish first. Studies show these children do better than their peers but folk still fear it like they fear what they dont understand. If we was to make this the rule instead of the exception, every child would profit from it. We dont need every teacher speaking two languages - that aint realistic. But we sure could use some special helpers who know both tongues, like scouts who know both sides of the border.",
            "From the time we are young they tell us there is something greater than ourselves out there in the vast dark. Something beyond knowing. The old ones send their young to houses of God built of wood and stone and glass where they learn tales passed down through time immemorial. Some take these stories into themselves like bread and water while others cast them away, declaring themselves alone in the void. We wander through our days seeking meaning in different vessels, different shapes, trading one truth for another like worn currency. All of us searching for that pale fire in the blackness that might lead us home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set in the failing light watching the rain beat against the tin roof, smoke rising from our cigarettes like lost prayers. Water ran in the gutters and drowned the flowers that mother had planted years ago. He looked out into the gray waste of evening with eyes that seemed to see both nothing and everything at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's rags, his skull showing through the thinning hair like something unearthed. We didnt speak. What words could fill such spaces. I moved closer and we watched the rain together while the day bled out into darkness.\n\nHe died in the winter. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him poison to fight the poison in his blood but it only stretched his suffering like a wire drawn too tight. I cursed God in the nighttime. Sat in rooms darker than any church and spoke no prayers to the emptiness. If there was something out there listening it had turned its face from us long ago.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not. The witnessing of such things marks a soul in ways that cant be unnamed. I wanted him alive in my memory not cold and white in some sterile room where machines counted down his last hours. They knew, all of them, that his only son would not stand vigil at his passing. I lay in my bed for three days like Jonah in the belly of the whale waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He was a man of the soil first and of politics second, this John Taylor of Caroline, and in him burned something fierce and righteous about the nature of freedom and the proper role of governance. The earth itself had shaped his thoughts on what a nation ought be, and from this came all else: his views on sovereignty and law and justice and the machinery of state.\n\nThe land was new then. Virgin territory for governance unmarred by the old ways that had poisoned the minds of men across the water. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever force breathed life into mankind were like links in an iron chain, break one and the whole thing falls to rust and ruin. These things, he reckoned, must stay beyond the reach of men who would rule other men.\n\nSome spoke of natural states where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, but Taylor knew civilization must rise above such base things. He carried within him a stark vision of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between. The government, he said, must account for both these forces dwelling in the hearts of men. Good was the protection of property and the cultivation of soil. Evil was the gathering of wealth through paper and promises. He knew that self-interest drove all men but saw how it could twist and corrupt, creating parasites who fed upon the labor of others.\n\nThe Constitution, he believed, must be read like scripture - strict but with wisdom. Let the federal government be small and bound by chains of paper and ink, for a fat government grows hungry and tyrannical. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be understood, the intentions of those who wrote it known. And above all else stood the Declaration, that first document which spoke of sovereign states joined in common cause but not merged into one great beast of governance.\n\nHe would have seen what was coming, this Caroline farmer. Would have watched the slow death of his agrarian dream with eyes that knew too well the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts when power called to them. But he planted his ideas like seeds in the furrows of a young nation's mind, and some took root and grow there still.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, thoughts coming and going unbidden and unbound by the constraints of consciousness until there was nothing left but the pure act of seeing.\n\nHe'd bought the book once. An art book. Some woman who wrote about the brain and how to make it draw what the eye sees true. She wrote of frames and squares and how to parse the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vast terrible everything of existence and cut it down to size. But there was no frame now. No square. Just the terrible brown truth of what lay before him.\n\nThe porcelain was white as bone. White as the skulls of dead things in the desert. He touched the silver handle with fingers that knew their purpose and watched the water spiral down like some primal force of nature. The brown mass stayed. Unmoved. Uncaring. Like something ancient buried in the earth that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nHe stood in his uniform. The green tie at his throat like a noose. The mop beside him like a companion in this strange ritual. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom cast no shadows and in their stark truth there was nowhere to hide from what must be done. He pulled at the paper on the wall, wrapping his hand like a man preparing for war, layer upon layer until the shape of his hand was lost in the whiteness. Then he reached down into the water the way a man reaches into his own past knowing there is no good thing to find there.\n\nThe water was cold. Cold as death. Cold as truth.",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their clean white coats say the young mind aint ready for such things. That it cannot grasp the weight of steel and speed and death that comes with it. But they drive all the same.\n\nThe inexperience sits in them like poison. Makes them roll vehicles that ought not roll. Makes them press pedals that ought not be pressed. Makes them leave roads that ought to be followed. And they travel in packs these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom that wolves carry in their blood. Some state men in California watched them die and counted the bodies and made charts of the dead showing how they died more when they ran together.\n\nThe state tried to fix it. Made papers that said when they could drive and who could ride with them. But papers dont stop blood from flowing when metal meets metal on the midnight highways. Papers dont make young minds old.\n\nSome doctor named Zuckerman he says even eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of it like addicts seeking poison. Says we ought to wait till the blood runs cooler in their veins. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there will be more of them. Children of the boomers coming up like dark clouds on the horizon ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nCould make a law about it. Simple thing really. Keep them learning in schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen years have passed. Make them prove themselves like California does with their fifty hours of watching and learning.

            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder and it lives in the spaces between hearing and knowing. Not in the ear itself but in the dark corridors of the brain where sound becomes meaning. Like a demon that steals understanding from the minds of those afflicted leaving them whole in body but fractured in comprehension.\n\nThe disorder moves through three territories and we will walk them all. First the nature of the thing itself. Then the marking of its presence in the afflicted, the signs writ in behavior and confusion that herald its existence. Last the methods by which those who teach might aid the cursed ones in rooms full of the blessed.\n\nIt began in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with names like Bocca and Calearo hunting for understanding in the minds of children who could hear but could not listen. They created tests. Mapped the territories of confusion. In 1977 they gathered, these searchers of broken sound, to share their dark knowledge.\n\nThe disorder manifests like a ghost in the machine of consciousness. Some cannot locate sound in space as if the world were flat and dimensionless. Some cannot parse the difference between sounds that fall like rain upon their ears. Some cannot hear the mockery in a voice or the anger beneath soft words. The sounds come but meaning dies stillborn in the mind.\n\nThey test for it now with machines and questionnaires and observations recorded in careful hands. Audiologists and speech pathologists move through the darkness of the affliction with their instruments like blind men with sticks, tapping at the walls of comprehension. They send sounds into the ear like scouts into enemy territory and measure what returns. But no single test can capture its presence fully. The disorder remains elusive, like smoke in a closed room, its origins unknown, its territory mapped but never fully conquered.",
            "They were the lost ones. The broken ones. Children with eyes like empty wells and families splintered like old wood left too long in the sun. I knew them before I knew their names. Knew their stories written in bruises and silence. The social work, it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night.\n\nService and respect aint just words writ on paper. They're carved deep in the bone. In the marrow. Ethics aint something you learn from books neither. You carry it or you dont.\n\nI wandered them halls of learning for years, watching them young ones flee from their demons. Some found poison in the bottle, others in the needle. After Piedmont College in 09 I drifted like smoke until that summer day when fate showed its hand. There was this boy. Sixteen maybe. Sitting scared on my friend's couch like a sparrow in a thunderstorm. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave scars deeper than skin.\n\nI went to their house. The law was there already, blue lights cutting through the twilight like cold stars. Told them what I knew. What I'd learned in them psychology books. They asked me to talk to the parents and I did. Heard their excuses like bitter wind through dead trees. Simple disputes, they called it. Simple. Nothing simple about terror in a child's eyes.\n\nJustice. That's what they say we got but it aint true. Society wants its people to follow like sheep. Wants em numbered and counted and sorted. But I seen different. Seen the truth of it. In school I fought against their rules like a wolf fights against the trap. Colored my hair wild colors that nature never dreamed of. Marked my flesh with metal. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Gay. Straight. Bisexual. All God's creatures carrying their own truth.\n\nRacism and hate, they're like poison in the well. Been fighting against em since I could stand. Still am. Always will be. That's the path I chosen. Or maybe it chosen me. Either way, here I am, walking toward them dark places where children cry in the night, carrying whatever light I got left to give.",
            "Sleep comes unbidden like a thief in the night or it doesnt come at all. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like some dark totem carved from the bones of sleepless nights, its shadow cast long across the biological and sociocultural planes of human understanding. They who study such things speak of models and methods, of inherited traits passed down through blood and bone, and of the world that shapes us like wind shapes stone.\n\nThe categorization of sleep's absence comes in three forms, each more merciless than the last. Primary disorders stand alone like sentinels in the night. Others walk hand in hand with the demons of the mind, those axis disorders that plague mankind since time immemorial. And still others come from the poison we put in our bodies or the failing of our mortal shells.\n\nIn the realm of primary disorders there are the Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, names given by men in white coats to the horrors that stalk the night. Insomnia, that cruel mistress, denies sleep to those who seek it. Hypersomnia, her sister, drags men down into unwanted slumber like stones beneath dark water. Narcolepsy strikes like a serpent, sudden and without mercy. The Parasomnias bring their own terrors - nightmares that tear through the mind like wolves through flesh, sleep terrors that freeze the blood, and sleepwalking that sends the unconscious body wandering through the dark hours.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the microscopic spaces between life and death, neurons fire like distant stars. They carry orexin, the messenger of wake and sleep, through channels as old as time itself. The scientists, they found these things in mice first. GABAB receptors, they called them, gatekeepers of consciousness. When they opened these gates with their chemicals and medicines, sleep came like a flood. But nature is cruel and what works in mice may not work in men. The inheritance of such mechanisms through bloodlines means some are born to wander the night while others sleep sound in their beds.",
            "Been here two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters in this place they call University Park where the wind howls cold across empty spaces between buildings and the snow falls sideways like God's own spite. Started out in East Halls, far as you could go before hitting wilderness and stadium concrete. Stuart Hall was home then. Twenty-five minutes walking to Willard through weather that'd freeze the heart of hell itself. That's how it goes in State College.\n\nTalked once to someone who'd been here before. Not much older but spoke of different times. Said East Halls stood alone then, separated by vast emptiness like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields and buildings rise up from that emptiness. New Creamery. New health building. Apartments sprout like weeds in cracked earth. Campus grows like some living thing, stretching, expanding, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nThe bicycle. That's what saves you here. Simple machine of steel and rubber but it needs more than just existing. Needs riders. Needs paths. Needs purpose.\n\nFriend of mine found his way back to cycling after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. Nothing else like it for getting around, he said, fashion be damned. Bowl of oatmeal becomes thirty miles of freedom. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm ever was. Bought a bike. Best thing I done. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from where I sleep. On the bike, five minutes if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it ain't friendly. Not to bikes. Not to nothing really.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time ain't one of them. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in wind. More when you count everything else needs doing. Time's a currency can't be borrowed back once spent. Bike saves what little I got left of it.",
            "They had come to see what the old man Huxley had writ about the machines and the money and how they worked together like serpents in the dark. In his book about the brave world that was to come he showed them people who lived not as ones but as many, folks who sought nothing but the quick pleasure of the moment like animals rutting in the field. And above them all stood the Controller like some dark god, moving his pieces across a board none could see.\n\nThe dead prophets of old had spoke of such things. Marx and his ilk who saw how the powerful made the weak believe lies about their own chains. In this new world they had built the people were less than cattle, branded and sorted by letters like freight in a trainyard. Deltas. Gammas. Names that meant nothing and everything. They filled their heads with whispered commands while they slept, telling them to spend and want and need until there wasnt nothing left inside them that was their own.\n\nWeren't no real love in this place neither. The people moved through their days like ghosts, touching but never feeling, speaking but never saying. The men talked of women like they was discussing livestock, measuring their worth in flesh and curves they called pneumatic. The women were no better, trading stories of their rutting like they was discussing the weather. Each class of folk stayed in their place like it was writ in stone, believing the lies they'd been fed since before they could walk. They consumed and obeyed and never looked up to see the bars of their cage, thinking themselves free while wearing chains they'd been taught to love.\n\nThe Controller watched it all from his high tower, knowing what Marx knew - that if you tell a man he's special while you rob him blind, he'll thank you for the privilege. And so they went on, all of them, dancing to music they couldn't hear, played by hands they couldn't see.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The question hung in the air like woodsmoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since the towers fell have shifted like desert sands, the wind of public opinion blowing first one way then another, media voices crying hostility then tolerance in equal measure. Now we stand in a time where a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his lineage, could reach for the highest seat in the land. Such things were not dreamt of in the days when the towers still stood.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. It moves against what history whispers, like two streams flowing contrary. I had known Muhammad as a conqueror, a man who bent tribes to his will and branded their souls with his faith through steel and fire. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of men until they saw truth in his words and came crawling through the dust to drink from his wisdom. \n\nThey write of miracles that echo like mockingbirds singing borrowed songs. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes, feeding forty when it should have fed few. The writers craft their prophet in borrowed robes, dressing him in the cast-off garments of the Nazarene. They diminish Christ's glory by making their prophet wear his face like a mask.\n\nTheir stories come wrapped in layers of telling, each voice more distant than the last. They say this man told that man who heard from another, words passing through countless mouths like water through too many vessels, each one losing something in the pouring. They meant these tellings to be proof but they stand as hollow as desert bones bleached by sun and time.\n\nWhat gnaws at the mind is how they shape him soft and holy, this Muhammad. A gentle soul dispensing wisdom like morning dew. But history tells another tale, written in blood and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true shape of the man whose name they praise. The past carries its own truth, and no amount of gentle words can wash the blood from its pages.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of history while they marched forward with their own designs. The truth of it lay bare and bleeding in the centuries that followed, each generation stepping further from the source like concentric rings in dead water. Yet now something stirs in the minds of men. Some ancient knowing. The old guard stands fast with their dogma but their numbers thin like shadows at noon.\n\nThe Christians will remember. They will look back across the waste of years and see what was lost. What was added. Layer upon layer of doctrine like rust on pure metal. It may take generations, maybe more, but time bends back on itself like a snake eating its tail. They'll strip away the accumulated weight of centuries, peeling back the years like old paint until nothing remains but the raw wood of his words, unvarnished and true.\n\nWhen this knowing sweeps across the old countries like wildfire, burning away the chaff of centuries, the church will abide. But it will be changed. The countless branches of belief will draw together like scattered cattle before a storm. The differences between them will blur and fade like old photographs left in the sun. Unity will rise from diversity like a phoenix from ash.\n\nHistory moves in great circles. The Romans who fed Christians to lions knelt before crosses in time. The land that chains broke now bears black leaders. And so too will Christianity circle back to its source, seeking truth in the bones of its beginning. They'll read his words anew, not as stone tablets but as living things, metaphors breathing in the mind.\n\nBefore all this there was only Judaism. Before Rome planted its eagles in Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the pillars. But even then the people split like light through crystal - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who walked between them all.",
            "The darkness that dwells in men's hearts aint no mystery and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Like wolves they are, prowling through the night, seeking only their own fortunes and caring nothing for the weak that fall beneath their feet. The book lays it bare and cold and true.\n\nYou see it most in them factory bosses, them kings of industry who sit high in their towers of brick and iron. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, their only god being the almighty dollar. Sinclair writes of how them buildings stood against the sky like ancient ruins, dark towers belching forth rivers of smoke that stretched on forever into the void, as if hell itself had opened its maw upon the earth. The owners, they didnt care none about what their machines did to the air or how their waste poisoned the ground. The rivers ran thick with blood and offal from ten thousand beasts, but profit was their only truth.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Expendable. Replaceable. Like Sinclair says, the whole place was nothing but a cauldron of hate, where a man's worth was measured only in coins. They'd work a man till his hands bled and his spirit broke, then cast him aside like a spent shell casing. No warning. No mercy. Just the cold mathematics of greed.\n\nIn them days there weren't no laws to protect the weak. No safety nets. No guardian angels. The factory was a beast that fed on flesh and bone, grinding up immigrants and poor folk alike in its terrible machinery. Them that lived in Packingtown was caught in a web of misery with no escape, like flies in a spider's web. The unions that claimed to help was just another kind of parasite, feeding off the desperation of them that had nothing left to give.\n\nThey called it progress but it was slavery by another name. As Sinclair put it, them foreign folk and poor people was hanging by a thread, their very existence dependent on the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And just like them ancient slavers, these modern masters bred the same rot in men's souls, the same darkness that turns brother against brother and makes monsters of men.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Word was he took to writing bout some place called Thulé, twice marking it in his verses like a man marking the start and end of his territory. Virgil knew of this place too, wrote of it in times long past, called it an island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness. But there was something else, something closer to our time that bore watching.\n\nPoe had himself a powerful thirst for German writing, deep and relentless as any desert wanderer. There was this man Goethe, wrote himself a thing called Faust, published in two pieces like a broken mirror, first part in 1808, second when death came calling for him in 32. Inside that second piece lay hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé they called it. Story goes of a king whose woman died leaving him nothing but a goblet and memories that drove him to drink. Grief ate at him like rust on iron till he gave everything away save that cup, walked himself to the edge of the world and cast it into the black waters below, then closed his eyes for the last time.\n\nYou can see the shadows of one man's writing in the other's, like blood seeping through floorboards. Both speaking of loss and drink and darkness. Both walking through lands where the sun fears to tread. Poe took that word Thulé and made it his own in The Pit and Pendulum, then again in Dreamland, bookending his verses like a man marking his grave at both ends.\n\nIn Dreamland the speaker wanders through a world stripped of color, haunted by ghosts of them that's gone before, like some dark mirror of Goethe's grieving king. Both men, separated by ocean and years, writing bout the same darkness, same loneliness, same weight of memory that drives men to drink and death.\n\nWeren't no accident neither. Poe knew Goethe's work like a man knows the scars on his own hands. Had to, being the kind that followed Tennyson's writings close as a shadow. The German's words was everywhere in them days, spreading like wildfire through the minds of them that read, and Poe, he was always one to watch the flames.",
            "The law speaks of malice and punishment in the sunbaked streets of California where a woman fell and broke herself upon the tiled floor of a market. The floor gleamed wet with spilled applesauce like some pale blood of commerce and the manager sat in his office eating his dinner while the world turned and customers walked the aisles unwarned.\n\nThey had told him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan coming to his door like prophets of some minor doom and he had turned them away with words about time and dinner and things that could wait. But things that wait carry their own judgment and at half past five Palmer found the slick spot that waited patient as a snake and fell. Her back broke or near enough to it. The fifth such falling in that year alone, as if the store itself hungered for broken bodies upon its floor.\n\nThe question of punishment lies cold as stone in the hands of judges who must weigh despicable acts against the letter of civil code. Section 3294 speaks of malice like some ancient text, defining the darkness in men's hearts when they know the danger that waits and yet do nothing. The manager knew. He had seen five others fall in that same year, their bodies marking the calendar of his negligence like stations of some retail cross.\n\nThe courts have spoken before of such things. In Taylor they drew the lines between simple failure and willful disregard, between accident and malice. They spoke of men who see the consequences coming like dark riders on the horizon and choose to let them ride. The manager saw them coming. Twice warned and twice he waved them on, choosing his dinner over the safety of those who walked his aisles in trust.\n\nThe law will not dismiss this easily. It will weigh the manager's indifference against the broken body of Palmer and find there something more than simple neglect. Something that speaks of conscious choice and willing blindness to consequence. Something that carries the weight of punishment beyond mere compensation.",
            "The wanting had been there always. A void that would not fill. It came upon her in her fourteenth year like some dark spirit that takes hold and will not loose its grip and even now three years hence it remained steadfast and cruel in its persistence. She knew now it was not a thing she sought but a someone and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They came to her with their fumbling advances and their awkward words but she felt nothing. She questioned this strangeness in herself, this absence of desire that seemed to mark her different from other girls her age. Years of thinking on it had yielded nothing but hollow theories that crumbled like ash in her hands.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through life like two leaves carried by the same stream, never quarreling, never raising voices except when their daughter's wild spirit threatened to break free of their gentle waters. She was their opposite, full of light and motion, drawing others to her like moths to flame yet carrying in her heart a kindness that made her beloved by all who knew her.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried death in its teeth. She wandered the rooms seeking something unnamed when her mother's scream cut through the silence like a blade. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain twisting her face into something ancient and terrible. Mama, she said. Mama what's wrong. The words came broken and gasping. Hospital, her mother said. Take me. The girl lifted her mother like a child, thankful for the strength in her arms that she had built over years. She carried her to the car and laid her in the back like some precious cargo and drove through streets that seemed suddenly foreign and hostile.\n\nThe hospital rose before them like a white monument to suffering. Inside the air hung thick with chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to the woman in her arms. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling a narrow bed between them. They took her mother away down corridors that seemed to stretch into forever and left her alone with her thoughts in a plastic chair that had held countless others before her, all waiting, all afraid.\n\nLater they would tell her how her mother had reached for something beautiful, a simple vase high up where such things are kept, and how the stool had betrayed her like all simple things sometimes do.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistical dark. Not the diet of their fathers but something older still. Plant foods and fish flesh and the oils that run golden, not white like the rendered fats of beasts. The drink too, measured and portioned like sacrament.\n\nThey had seen it before in other studies, dark auguries in the data that showed how death came slower to those who followed the old ways. The heart's betrayals less frequent, the body's weight held in check. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that thief of mind and movement.\n\nThey gathered their witchcraft of numbers from seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, all nurses, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. None had the sugar sickness nor the heart's early warnings. For twenty years they watched and waited, gathering their testimonies six times over, asking what passed their lips and in what measure. The women marked their papers faithful as penitents, year after year, more than nineteen in twenty staying true to the cause.\n\nWhen death came they searched the records, the cold files of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable, lacking the certainty of paper proof, but these too they counted in their ledger of loss. They weighed all things: the smoke in their lungs, the pills they took, the blood that ceased its monthly flow, the sweat of their leisure hours.\n\nThrough machines that counted and sorted they fed their numbers, adjusting for the chaos of living, for age and smoke and flesh and movement. And in the end the truth came clear as bones in desert sand. Those who followed closest the Mediterranean way, they died less from the heart's failings and the brain's dark floods. In numbers it showed: two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts stopped or wounded, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke's shadow, one thousand seventy-seven souls taken by the combined assault of heart and brain.\n\nThe numbers spoke their truth. Those who ate as the ancients ate, they lived longer than their sisters who did not. This was the power of old wisdom written in modern blood.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign reads. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stands at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old. Dark ink bleeding into the corrupted pulp. Burma they call it now though names mean nothing in such places where men with guns make their own truth. Since sixty-two the soldiers have ruled there, taking power like thieves in the night, their boots echoing down empty streets where democracy once walked.\n\nThey came in saffron robes, the monks did. Walking the streets like fire made flesh, their procession a silent scream against the military that ruled their world. At first the government let them be but violence has its own gravity and soon enough the night was filled with the sound of splintering temple doors and the wet thud of rifle butts against flesh. The foreign writers disappeared into concrete cells or wooden boxes. A Japanese man named Nagai bled out on the street, his camera still clicking as his life leaked away into the dust.\n\nThirteen dead they say. But the colonel who fled speaks of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle night. The truth of it lost to the darkness like so many truths before.\n\nThese things are old as time itself. Rome's emperors claimed divine right while they burned the world. The sons of heaven rule Japan still, their divinity unchanged by cars and computers and ritual death. Here in our own land the president speaks to holy men who sell salvation like carnival barkers hawking painted shells.\n\nThe stories repeat. Tiananmen Square ran red while tanks ground students into the pavement. Rwanda's machetes flashed in the sun as neighbor killed neighbor. Hitler's ovens burned day and night until the sky itself turned gray with ash.\n\nAnd still we stand here, holding signs against the darkness, as if paper and ink could stop bullets and hate.",
            "The ghost of Duke Ellington haunts the halls of jazz like some dark specter that won't lay down to rest, his presence carved deep into the bones of music by years that stretched longer than most men dare dream. At the piano his touch was light as morning dew but in the composition of sound he was more akin to some mad architect building cathedrals of brass and wood and breath. He knew the souls of his players like a father knows his sons and he built frameworks of notes wherein they could wander free as wild horses or march strict as soldiers depending on what the music called for.\n\nThe sound lived in him and through him and he knew how to make it speak in tongues both strange and beautiful. Each player was a color on his palette and he painted with them all, making pictures in the air that no man had seen before and few since have matched. The dictionary men speak of something called Creole Love Call where he took the human voice and stripped it bare of words, leaving only pure sound like some primal thing that crawled up from the swamp of time.\n\nThe piece moves like this: First comes the voice pure as spring water calling out to reeds that answer back, the voice growing rough like old leather toward the end. Then a trumpet muted and crying blue notes into the darkness. A clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The whole band takes up the call then, brass and reeds speaking back and forth like lovers in the night. At the height of it all the reeds cry out high and wild while brass and rhythm punch holes in time itself. Then back to the beginning it goes, voice and reeds once more, but now the voice has learned to growl like some beast that's found its way into church. It ends with a woman's voice running wild and a trombone speaking blasphemy.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin, trumpet singing like a man and voice playing like brass. Later in It Don't Mean a Thing he let Nanton loose with that muted trombone of his, and if there's any sound in this world that can tell you what a soul in torment sounds like, that's the one.",
            "The shells carry their own mathematics, though men have long stood dumb before their geometries. In 1917 Thompson spoke true when he said that no zoologist had yet dreamed in the language of numbers what nature had wrought in bone and calcium, and his words echo still across the century like the voice of some dead prophet.\n\nThe mollusks build their homes in spiral paths through time and space, each revolution marking another turn in their blind journey through existence. These whorls, as men name them, spiral around an axis that ain't there except in theory, like the pole star that guides men through darkness but exists only in their minds. The columella stands as the spine of the thing, anchoring each whorl to the next in an ancient agreement between flesh and mineral.\n\nWe took their ghosts in X-ray light and fed their numbers to machines that could speak their language. The software called CerioShell consumed these measurements like some digital oracle, spitting forth predictions of forms that might be or might have been. We sought to understand the boundaries of what could exist, as if mapping the territories between the possible and impossible.\n\nThe shell grows like a testament to time itself, each revolution marking another cycle in the endless wheel of life and death. The suture line divides yesterday from today, while the body whorl stands as the final chapter in the creature's autobiography writ in calcium. The spire reaches upward like the tower of some prehistoric babel, its apex pointing toward heaven or whatever lies beyond.\n\nThrough the aperture the living thing reaches out into the world, that opening like a door between two realms - one of flesh and one of stone. We studied these shells from every angle - apical, basal, apertural - seeking in their symmetries some truth about the laws that govern all living things.\n\nTo count the whorls is to count chapters in a book written in the language of survival. Draw a line where the first suture begins and follow it through space like tracking the path of a star across the night sky. Each quarter turn tells its own story.\n\nThe mathematics of their existence can be captured, contained in formulae that describe the path of that opening through space and time. But numbers alone cant tell the whole truth of it. They are like marks on a map that show the way but not the journey.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers on the page. Ten years gone and the dead babies in Indonesia lay just as numerous as before, small corpses in their mothers' arms like broken birds. The country had met some of its promises, water flowing cleaner now through pipes and sewers, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same. The reasons lay scattered like bones in the sand, waiting to be counted.\n\nIn the villages and towns the midwives came more often now, seven births in ten seeing their weathered hands. But these women, these healers of old ways, stood powerless when the blood came too fast and too much, when death rode in on a crimson tide. The numbers spoke false comfort. And fewer children with the bloody flux saw proper doctors now, their mothers carrying them home to wait out their fever dreams, some to wake and some to sleep eternal.\n\nThe knife-birth, the cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. Four in hundred mothers felt its mercy. In the cities it came more often, seven mothers in hundred saved by the blade, but in the far places only two. The poor watched their sisters die while the rich lived on, a gap wide as twenty-seven graves between them. Money spoke here as it spoke everywhere, deciding who lived and who returned to dust.\n\nThey argued now about the path forward, whether to build towers of specific care or strengthen the whole edifice of healing. The targeted way beckoned like a mirage, promising quick victory, but carried poison in its heart. When money flowed to one wound, others festered untended. The helpers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving other sufferers to their fate. And in their haste they built parallel roads to the same destination, wasting precious time with papers and forms, duplicate wheels spinning in the sand while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like kudzu in summer heat, sprawling across a hundred years of human sound until no man could count its tendrils or name its parts. Within its vast territory lay kingdoms of sound - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk - but these too had split and divided like cells beneath a microscope, spawning bastard children that grew teeth and claws of their own.\n\nAmong these dark offspring Heavy Metal stood tallest, most terrible in its beauty. For forty years it had grown and mutated, showing faces both beautiful and grotesque, faces that spoke of rage and despair and sometimes joy though mostly it dwelt in shadows. The darkness called to others and they came, bearing guitars like weapons, and each who came carved out their own territory in the night until the territories became uncountable.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured, its boundaries fluid as mercury. What it is or aint no one can rightly say. It drinks deep from other wells of sound but its origins remain, black as pitch and twice as thick. To know the metal you must know its heart, must understand that it aint just music but a movement of souls through darkness.\n\nThe movement feeds on excess like a fever. More bass more volume more violence more theater until the ears bleed and the mind screams. Them that play it are masters of their craft, fingers flying across strings like spiders weaving webs of sound. In the seventies they found the drugs, or the drugs found them, and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like messages from some terrible heaven. It spoke truths other music dared not speak, reaching into places where light feared to go. Some say it draws power from them old Romantic composers, them that knew the darkness before electricity gave it voice. The proof's in the words they sing, black poetry that bleeds onto the page.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they maybe didn't mean to open. That song carried the sickness in it, the up-and-down fever dream of chemical paradise. Some call it the first real Metal song, though it was just them trying to outdo them Rolling Stones, to prove they could walk in darkness too. They put it on that white album like a black seed in white soil, never knowing what would grow from it.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their canvases of madness there was another who walked alone in the gardens of his mind. Rousseau was his name and he painted what he saw there. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this vision of a woman lost in some verdant paradise, though it was more than that. It was his own yearning made manifest, his hunger for acclaim that gnawed at him like some desperate animal.\n\nHe carried within him two warring spirits. One whispered of conformity, of following the paths others had worn smooth with their passing. The other spoke of wildness, of walking where none had walked before. These spirits clashed and bled within him all the days of his life.\n\nThe man himself came into the world in Laval, a town in the French northwest, in the year 1844. His father worked metal and sold hardware and knew something of comfort though not of wealth. The boy grew without learning the ways of art, became instead a collector of tolls for the state until he had seen forty winters pass. They called him douanier though this was wrong, he being merely a gabelou, a distinction that mattered little to any but those who wore such titles.\n\nDeath stalked him as it stalks all men but showed particular cruelty in taking eight of his children before they drew more than a handful of breaths each. Then it took his wife Clémence leaving him with only the girl Julia and a grief that sat in him like stone. He turned to painting then as a drowning man turns to any floating thing, hoping it might bear his weight and carry him to some distant shore.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. Matisse and others were rising then, their stars ascending while he labored in obscurity. Matisse feared the common and fought against it with every stroke of his brush while Rousseau sought it like a lover, thinking perhaps that in perfect conformity he might find perfect acceptance. But the heart wants what it wants and his brush followed paths of its own choosing, leading him through strange forests of the mind where no other had ventured.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions across the wasteland of mans thoughts. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, that beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things we learn come from books or the hard ways of life but these twin riders of truth and beauty they come to us like ghosts in the night unbidden and unexplained. We dont learn them so much as recognize them like the face of someone we knew before we were born.\n\nYou can talk about what makes something right or beautiful but you'll never catch its soul in your words. Like trying to describe the Mona Lisa. You can go on about shadow and light and what them Italian painters was thinking but in the end its just wind. People look at something beautiful and they say theres just something about it and then they try to explain but the explaining aint never enough. Same with whats right and wrong. OConnor knew it. Said you tell stories cause regular words wont do. Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics was beyond telling.\n\nThe connection twixt right and beautiful runs deeper than most think. Both of them hit you in places you cant name, like getting struck by lightning but the burns aint visible. Literature carries this burden more than other arts cause it deals in the currency of human souls. McKean wrote that moral standards might not matter much to music but they matter to stories like they matter to life itself. Stories traffic in values like a merchant trades in gold and the values is what makes them precious to us.\n\nWe recognize the truth of this like we recognize the shadow of death. It aint something you can point to or measure with any tools made by man. Its just there, waiting in the dark corners of our understanding, patient as stones, eternal as the desert night.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient beast from the earth, its spine the alps at München stretching north through darkness and light to where the Baltic waters lap at Kiel's cold shores. This same spirit moves through the land like blood through veins, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds dark and knowing. That such a thing should come from many sources surprises no man who knows the way of tribes and blood and earth.\n\nGermania. The name itself carries weight like old bones in the ground, disputed by men who claim to know its truth but find only shadows. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, their name changing like wind-blown sand from German to something else, something older. Caesar too spoke the word Germanus in his writings of war and conquest, taking it from Gaulish tongues to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of spears or of shouting, but such meanings are lost now like footprints in snow.\n\nIn the year ninety-eight Tacitus put down in words what he knew of these people, claiming them pure as winter water, untouched by the mixing of blood that marked other lands. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern shores for this wild country with its gray skies and darker woods, unless it were already written in their blood?\n\nThe Romans came but did not stay, their armies moving like shadows across the land, taking what they would and retreating south again to their marble halls and painted walls. The Germanic tribes lived in the spaces between, trading what the forest gave them, selling their strength to Roman generals who knew the worth of men who had grown strong in hard places. They lived thus on the edge of empire, neither fully in nor fully out, like wolves at the firelight's edge.",
            "In the dark theater of deception that is Twelfth Night there runs a truth cold and stark as winter bone. That a mask once worn becomes more than mere covering but a second skin that must be torn away lest it consume the wearer whole. And in the tearing there is blood and there are those who would turn away from such revelation.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own particular poison. What darkness in the soul drives one to shed their given form and take up another. For Viola the answer comes like a whispered prayer in the night. Preservation. Survival. The ancient instinct of prey. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke.\n\nShe walks the path of manhood and finds herself cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. A lone wolf in sheep's clothing. And the deception breeds its own complications dark and twisted as roots beneath the earth. Olivia's heart turns toward this false man with the fervor of religious conversion. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead leaves. And there is Orsino too whose own desires wreath around Viola like thorned vines: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nPerhaps to modern eyes the play speaks to deeper truths buried beneath custom and propriety like bones beneath soil. The deception acts as spade turning earth revealing what lies beneath. Olivia's passion for Cesario might speak to hidden waters running deep but more likely stands as Shakespeare's mirror held up to those who would judge the book by its binding. This truth reveals itself when she turns from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a snake striking, claiming the disguised Viola not as lover but blood: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words final as a coffin lid closing.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing that carried with it the weight of genocide and the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples who walked those scorched plains. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and that's the truth of it.\n\nIn the east where the land was green they left behind them educated men who could read and write and cipher and when the British came in 1919 they found these men and knew their worth. In Kamerun too they done the same and visitors wrote of it with approval in their books.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. Different in a way that cant be explained by simple tellings. While the government built schools in the east and taught the natives there, in the southwest they gave that task to the missionaries and gave them little help besides. Yet they poured money like water into schools for the white children, both government schools and mission schools alike. These choices echoed long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their mark in the world, in South West Africa most remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe land itself told part of the tale. It was a hard country, mostly desert, but with enough temperance in its climate to draw white settlers like moths to flame. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand souls, three times more than lived in East Africa which was the next most settled of their lands. The settlers came and with them came their notions and their prejudices and their fears, and these things shaped the way the teaching was done or wasnt done, depending on whose children needed learning.\n\nThe old books tell of this time, most wrote in German when the empire still stood or in the years right after. Later came the English writers who looked deeper, compared one place to another, sought to understand why things were done the way they were done. A man named Cohen wrote of it, of how the settlers changed everything, though maybe he didnt see all the darkness that lay beneath.",
            "Blood and dust marked the path between these two nations, stretching fifty-seven years across the scarred earth like a wound that would not heal. The republic to the north and the republic to the south, each eyeing the other across that vast expanse of desert and mountain where men died nameless deaths beneath an indifferent sun.\n\nThey fought their war in forty-six, the Americans coming down like locusts, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in a storm of gunpowder and manifest destiny. But the war was just the center of it. Before and after there were skirmishes and raids, men crossing invisible lines drawn by men who had never seen the land they divided. The people of these nations carried old hatreds like sacred relics, passed down from Spanish galleons and English sailing ships, from cathedrals and protestant churches where each cursed the other's god in different tongues.\n\nThe border between them was like a rope pulled taut, vibrating with tension. Such is the way of nations that share earth and sky but not blood or belief. The Americans looked south and saw papistry and monarchy, things their grandfathers had fled across an ocean to escape. The Mexicans looked north and saw heretics and usurpers, come to take what was never theirs to claim.\n\nBandits and raiders moved across this divide like wraiths, striking at settlements and vanishing back across the line, caring nothing for flags or treaties. Seventeen times the nations clashed in those years, each clash marked in ledgers and books but written truly in blood on the desert floor. The raids continued until both armies came to the frontier, and even then the peace was bought with steel and lead.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like all things born of hate and fear. Mexico bent like a reed in an American wind, and the northern republic's hunger changed from land to gold, from conquest to commerce. But the memory of those years lies still in the earth, in the bones of the nameless dead, in the wind that blows across two nations that once stained the desert red.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some primitive need for safety, the kind that was absent in my youth. They'd say you'll always find work, always have bread, for the sick and dying never cease their coming. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing, though it healed nothing in me.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone and alone, pockets empty as a desert well, body betraying every command. Still am. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I owned has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war, its own assault on what little certainty remains. Nothing solid to grasp except one truth: without the blood-bonds of family and the handful who stayed, I'd have been dust. When the real darkness comes, ain't nobody feels strong.\n\nLife brings its calamities, big and small, like storm clouds gathering on a horizon you can't outrun. No matter how you fortify against it, some tempests are too mighty to weather alone.\n\nThese United States need weaning from the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust our own kind again, to reach out hands both ways - helping and accepting help - than each soul digging their own hole to hide in.\n\nThey speak of rugged individualism like it's gospel, but what kept our ancestors breathing wasn't the lone wolf spirit. It was breaking bread together, sharing what little they had, knowing a neighbor's need was your own. Them wagon trains that crossed the Rockies didn't make it on solitary courage.\n\nBe ready, sure. Got my own cache of supplies - medical stuff, water tablets, window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Got light for the darkness and food for the hunger. If you've got land to work and knowledge to preserve its bounty, do it. Ain't no shame in preparation.\n\nBut while you're stocking up, learn your neighbor's name. Might be the most important preparation of all.",
            "In the ancient times before Christ walked the earth there was born a prince who would come to be known as Buddha and he walked the earth and saw the suffering of men and cast off his worldly possessions like a snake sheds its skin and found enlightenment in the barren places where men go to die. And from his teachings came forth Buddhism and chief among its sects was Theravada and it endured through the centuries like a stone worn smooth by water. Twenty five hundred years have passed and the religion has changed like all things must change and you can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year and the monks and common folk gather though Buddha spoke nothing of such things in his time. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony and reach into the very marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have altered their sacred principles as time passed like wind reshaping the desert and these changes came from within and without like thieves in the night some bearing knives and some bearing nothing at all.\n\nThey speak of forces internal and external like twin serpents coiled around the faith. The internal force rises from those who call themselves Buddhist be they monk or layman and the external comes from those who stand outside the faith like wolves at the edge of firelight. And some forces come with malice burning in their hearts seeking to tear down what Buddha built and these they call hostile while others neither help nor harm but move through the world like dust storms that care nothing for what lies in their path and these they call benign.\n\nAt its heart the faith holds certain truths like ancient bones buried in deep earth. They seek shelter in three things: the Buddha himself and the Dhamma which is the word and the Sangha which is the community of faithful. The word is kept in three vessels they call pitakas and these contain all manner of things from rules to stories to the nature of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of there being no soul and of suffering that clings to life like smoke to cloth and of how nothing lasts and nothing stays and all things must pass away. Only by knowing these truths can a man break free from the wheel of death and rebirth that turns eternal like a millstone grinding souls to dust. And when enlightenment comes it burns away desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds men's minds. They have rules for living both for the common man who must not kill or lie or steal or rut like beasts or poison his mind with strong drink and for the monks who carry heavier burdens still. But above all else they hold to four noble truths that speak of suffering and its causes and its end like a map leading out of darkness."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.

            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

There aint no single truth to it no more than there's a single truth to man. Those who say all Russians are this way or all Japanese are that way speak with tongues of children, knowing nothing of the dark waters that run beneath such simple words.\n\nThe negotiator who comes to foreign soil carries with him the weight of his own world like a stone in his pocket. He measures what he sees against what he knows and sometimes the measuring dont add up right. Sometimes it dont add up at all.\n\nYou could spend your days studying the history books or walking the streets where the people you aim to know have walked. But judgment aint the way. The way is acceptance, cold and pure as mountain water. This is doubly true when you come to the table bearing a weaker hand, like a man bringing a knife to a gunfight. And if youre standing on their ground, you best mind their ways and their beliefs, lest the ground shift beneath your feet and leave you standing in nothing but air.\n\nBut culture aint just about nations and borders drawn in sand and blood. Companies got their own way too, their own rituals like ancient tribes. Some demand their people wear suits like armor, others let them come as they please. Some speak straight and true, others dance around words like moths round a flame. Even in America, where the corporate towers rise like steel mountains, each floor, each room might hold its own truth, its own way of being.\n\nThe why of it all, thats what matters most. Values run deeper than river water, darker than cave shadows. In some places a man would sooner die than shame his people in public. In others, the deal itself is sacred as scripture. You got to know these things before you sit at their table, before you break their bread. But knowing the man across from you, that's the real key. That's the lock that needs turning.\n\nThe negotiator who forgets these truths is like a blind man walking in a field of snakes. He might make it across, but the odds aint in his favor.",
            "The fool speaks of godlessness and in his speaking damns himself to darkness. These words echo from ancient psalms and rest heavy in the writings of Anselm, that old saint who sought to prove what cannot be proven. And Aquinas too, though separated by time and dust and blood, carried this same burden. They walked different paths but sought the same truth, and we must judge them as men seeking one God, not many, for to do otherwise would be to wander from the track like a blind dog in the desert night.\n\nNeither found the whole of it. That's the truth of it.\n\nAnselm's words came like wind through dead leaves, speaking of understanding through faith, as if God could be found in the caverns of man's mind alone. He said that because we can think of God we must accept his existence, like a man who dreams of water in the desert and believes the dream itself proves there are springs beneath the sand. The logic winds tight as a snare, but catches nothing substantial. Faith, they call it in their books and temples. Faith like a flame in darkness.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He believed God could be proven like a theorem, laid bare under the knife of reason until the truth bled out clear as morning. He built five towers of logic, each one reaching toward heaven: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and the terrible harmony of all things. Like a man finding tracks in the sand and knowing without seeing that something passed this way. God must exist, he said, because the world demands it. As if the universe itself was a puzzle with one piece missing and that piece must be God because nothing else would fit the void.\n\nThe truth of it lay somewhere between their words, maybe. Or maybe it lay nowhere at all. But their arguments stand like ancient stones in the desert, weathered but unmoving, and we who come after must make what sense of them we can.",
            "Words carry weight and writers know this truth deep in their bones. They wield their implements like knives, cutting meaning from the void. Some cut deeper than others. Fitzgerald knew this and in The Great Gatsby he carved his meanings with precision, though perhaps he did not know the fullness of what he wrought. He would take words that had no business laying together and force them into an unholy union, creating something new and terrible and beautiful. But it was in color that he found his truest voice, like an old testament prophet speaking in tongues of gold and green and white and red, though the meaning lay deeper than mere pigment or light.\n\nThe white and the gray spoke of sameness, of the crushing weight of uniformity that lay across the land like a burial shroud. White belonged to the moneyed folk, pristine and untouched, while gray was what remained when time had done its work. They wore their whites like armor - Daisy and Jordan moving through rooms like pale ghosts, Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's bacchanal, Tom's white shirt when he met his woman in the city. All of them wrapped in white like corpses prepared for burial. Only at Gatsby's revelries did the white give way, replaced by vulgar primary colors that screamed their defiance into the night.\n\nThe white crept into everything, staining the world like bleach. The canyons of New York stood white and terrible, the names of party guests faded to gray specters on Nick's papers, apartment buildings lined up like pale tombstones reaching toward a godless sky. The people too wore their colors like brands - Jordan and Daisy's white childhood marking them as surely as a rancher's iron, while in the valley of ashes gray cars crept through gray land like mechanical phantoms. Even the Italian child bore the mark of gray, and the old man selling dogs was gray as winter twilight.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald had loaded these colors with enough meaning they became weapons in his arsenal. Daisy appears again in white, in her white car, and we see her then for what she truly is - not a woman of flesh and blood but a uniform thing, a prize to be won, an object of Gatsby's desperate yearning. Her fur collar carries the gray like a prophecy, and when she appears again in white before the final confrontation it is both declaration and judgment, uniform and sentence all at once.",
            "The county lay spread before them like some fevered dream of plenty, the sun-bleached hills giving way to ordered rows of fruit and vine. They rode past fields of tomatoes blood-red in the morning light and citrus groves hanging heavy with bitter fruit. The land was good here. Always had been. Even now in these modern times the earth yielded its bounty to those who would work it, organic they called it now, though it was nothing more than the old ways come back around again.\n\nThey passed a farm where people gathered, city folk with their clean shoes and pressed clothes waiting in lines that stretched beyond counting just to claim their share of what the earth provided. Eggs and milk and honey. The old man spat in the dust. Said there was money in showing folks around too, letting them walk the paths between the crops like it was some kind of spectacle and not just the way things had always been done.\n\nThe piece they were looking at butted up against Cleveland Forest, one hundred and sixty acres of scrub and oak and grassland that wasnt native but had taken hold anyway like so many things in this country. The land had history. Indians had lived there longer than anyone could reckon, then the cattlemen came with their herds and the woodcutters with their axes and now here they were, talking about kangaroo rats and yellow-legged frogs like they were gold. Government men had lists of creatures they said needed saving, butterflies and birds with names like gnatcatcher, though who had ever caught gnats was another question entirely.\n\nThe old man said it would take more work than the regular way of farming, fighting the weeds and the bugs without poison, watching the crops die sometimes when there wasnt nothing you could do about it. But there was help to be had if you knew where to look, money from men in offices who'd never worked the land themselves but who'd decided how it ought to be worked all the same. The old man knew a place nearby that was making it work, organic they called it, though it was just farming the way his grandaddy would have known it.

But the wise know that promises need testing against the hard light of day.\n\nWe set our eyes on one called IHF, studying it like a tracker would study spoor in the desert sand. Comparing it against its ten largest holdings like comparing a wolf to the pack that made it. We aimed to know if owning the one was better than owning the ten separate, and if there might be some better way to arrange these pieces into something that would yield more bounty.\n\nThe task of examining every holding would be like counting every grain of sand in the Mojave so we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of what the thing held within its borders. These ten we listed out with their percentages like counting coup.\n\nTo know how these ten represented the whole we did the calculations, cold and merciless as winter arithmetic. We normalized them to hundred percent, figured their contribution to Beta and Return like some financial alchemist seeking truth in numbers. The results we laid out in charts black and stark as cemetery markers.\n\nWhat the numbers told was this: them ten holdings alone would yield 6.11 percent more than the ETF itself, like finding extra water in what you thought was a dry well. The Beta ran lower too, by point twelve. But numbers can lie like any man can lie and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just shadows cast by statistical moonlight.",
            "The numbers told a story and it wasnt a good one. They fell like dead leaves in that third month, scattered and forgotten on the cold New England ground. Winter had come as it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned like metal skeletons against the brick walls. The footprints in the snow grew fewer. The people who once walked now drove their machines, sealed against the wind and ice like pilgrims in iron churches.\n\nDecember brought its own peculiar madness. The scholars bent over their books and the teachers over their marks and the logging of journeys became a thing of ghosts and memories. Then the holidays came and the campus emptied like a dead town in some forsaken territory, wind whistling through the empty corridors where once there were footsteps.\n\nThey came back in January but the numbers stayed low, a fact that could not be explained away by the cold or the snow or the dark mornings that made men seek the comfort of their automobiles. February was worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash. We tried to rekindle it with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flaring that brought some warmth back to the numbers.\n\nThe truth was simpler and harder both. The machine had become like a second skin to these people, a carapace of steel and glass that spoke to something deeper than convenience. It was freedom itself, hammered into shape in Detroit and Tokyo, freedom that had seeped into the blood and bones of a nation. We fought it with trinkets - paper promises for coffee and books and food. But perhaps we should have fought steel with steel, tempted them with better machines - bicycles wrought fine as spiderwebs, automobiles that ran on lightning instead of dead dinosaurs. Maybe then the numbers would have told a different story. Maybe then the parking lots wouldn't have swallowed up the earth like tar pits, waiting to fossilize our good intentions.",
            "They were fifteen of them. Edison's trick films. Made in them years between 1895 and 1901 and stored now in that great repository of memory called the Library of Congress. Films that dealt in illusions and deceptions, wrought from the manipulation of the captured light itself. Most followed a strict catechism of rules, like ancient rites passed down through generations of showmen, though some dared venture beyond these bounds.\n\nThe films lived within wooden boxes, confined like prisoners to their proscenium frames. No movement of the eye that captured them, just the stark geometry of the stage inherited from those tattered vaudeville halls where magicians once plied their trade. The figures moved like specters across the frame, east to west, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In one such phantom play called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in that last year before the century turned, the players moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal rails, disappearing into the void beyond the frame's edge while the camera stood witness, immobile as stone.\n\nThese were pictures made at distance. No intimate portraits here. The camera kept its respectful remove like a mourner at a funeral, showing all and revealing nothing. Close-up shots were forbidden fruit in these early days, when the medium still wore its theatrical chains. The players kept to their appointed grounds, neither advancing nor retreating, trapped in that middle distance like souls in purgatory.\n\nTime itself was compressed in these reels. One shot, one film, that was the law. A minute or less of light and shadow, captured at varying speeds as if time itself was uncertain. They were simple things, these tricks. Disappearances, transformations, the stuff of carnival shows. But look closer at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, that grim spectacle from 1895. Watch how the illusion fractures if you study it hard enough, the moment when Mary's head becomes no more than a prop, though the eye wants to see it whole. That's the true trick of it. Not in the making but in the believing.",
            "In the dark hollows of literary history there lies what men call the Gothic Novel, a thing both ancient and new, like some terrible creature born of time itself. Ian Watt spoke of it as an oxymoron, this old-new thing, but words are wind and definitions are the chains men forge to bind what cannot be bound. The Gothic rides through our consciousness like a midnight rider, praised and damned in equal measure, called shallow by some and sublime by others who spoke of terror like Burke did, as if terror could be contained in words alone.\n\nIt began with Walpole and his Castle of Otranto, that first dark seed planted in the garden of letters. He took the ancient ways and the modern paths and wed them together like some unholy union, birthing what he named A Gothic Story. The gothic ways ran deep in it like roots in black earth - medieval theatre, stone arches pointing to heaven, traditions old as blood. Even then gothic meant many things to many men, like a word that had lost its way in time, wandering through centuries marked primitive by those who called themselves modern and enlightened.\n\nBut it was the marriage of these things - the theatrical gothic with its masks and its mysteries, and the novel with its way of peeling back the skull to see the thoughts beneath - that gave it life eternal. It became like some ageless thing, dead but not dying, new but not young, speaking across the vast desert of years to readers yet unborn.\n\nThe ghost of Chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that will not rest. In Otranto it lives and breathes, though changed from what it was in medieval times when knights rode forth in steel and honor. Walpole saw his world bereft of such things, saw politics and power strip bare the bones of honor until nothing remained but hollow men in hollow halls. He yearned for what was lost, for the idealized past that perhaps never was, but in that yearning he created something new.\n\nIn his character of Frederic we see this clearest, like looking through dark water to stones beneath. Before he steps onto the stage we know him by the marks of chivalry upon his soul - a prince who has known suffering, who has walked through fire and shadow, believed dead at the hands of infidels in some far land. Here stands the knight of old tales, but twisted, exaggerated, excessive like all things gothic must be, as if viewed through a glass that magnifies and distorts until the familiar becomes strange and the strange becomes familiar.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the minds of men who sought to move goods across vast spaces from maker to buyer through the raw materials and the making and the moving and all manner of commerce between. A consultant named Oliver had given it this name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. It was a process both simple and complex in its execution, like the weaving of a vast tapestry where each thread must find its place lest the whole thing come undone.\n\nSix elements existed in this chain and they were like the bones of some great beast: production and supply and inventory and location and transportation and information. Each one vital as blood, each one carrying its own weight in the grand scheme of things.\n\nProduction stood first among these elements, a foundation stone upon which all else was built. In the way of all things it began with want, with need, with desire. The managers would study the market like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what the people would buy and what they would not. They would make their decisions based on these auguries, choosing what would be made and where it would be made and how many would be made. Each decision carried weight, each choice echoing down through the chain like thunder across empty plains.\n\nHe had seen this himself in the great retail houses of Walmart and Target, where every action was prescribed and every movement calculated, down to the very clothes the workers wore and the way the trucks were emptied of their goods. It was a machinery vast and precise, and like all machinery it could fail if not tended proper.\n\nThen there was supply, that great decision of what would be done within the walls and what would be sent to others to do. They called it outsourcing when they sent the work away, seeking that thing they called velocity, though velocity was nothing more than the marriage of quality and flexibility with the eternal pursuit of lower costs. It was a dance of numbers and capabilities, of core competencies and strategic partnerships, all of it moving in a rhythm old as commerce itself.",
            "They came in the dark Victorian age like wraiths or phantoms stalking the halls of literature. Books of the aristocracy and their ways. Books of parlors and teacups and proper manners laid bare upon the page in infinite detail as if God himself had ordained their cataloguing. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from their kin like dark sheep in a pristine flock, carrying with them elements of mystery and the bizarre that no proper Victorian novel would dare embrace. These elements moved through the stories like smoke, seeping into the characters, making them more real somehow. More true.\n\n\"And now hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.\" That's what they wrote of Oliver. He walked between Sikes and Crackit who were not there but were there all the same, their voices real as gunsmoke in his ears. The boy stumbled through this fever dream while shots rang out and lights blazed across his vision like St. Elmo's fire and all the while pain rode him like a demon, constant and merciless.\n\nThese fever dreams and nightmares served as windows into souls. In Oliver's case they laid bare the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting came back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it came like a visitation, like judgment. He was there again. The pistol. The flash. The darkness. Some unseen hand bearing him away while Sikes and Crackit argued in his head like specters at a hanging. The pain was everywhere and nowhere. It had become like breathing. Like existing. The boy was powerless in this world of men and monsters, his will counted for nothing, and old Fagin's poison had already begun to work its way into his blood, into his bones, into whatever remained of hope.\n\nThe day that wasnt a day passed and night came again. Long night. Short night. Silent as death and gone in an instant.",
            "In them days I worked with the children after their schooling was done, them small faces bent over books and papers in the failing light. English and reading was what I knew best and that's what I done. There was this boy named Adrian, might've been nine or ten years old, struggling with his letters like a blind man counting coins. Something wasnt right with how he read. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs carved in stone by ancient peoples long dead.\n\nThe boy was Mexican sure enough but spoke English pure as any native born. We went on like that for a time until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some expedition. She stood there in her clean work clothes speaking no English at all, just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read right enough but the English letters was foreign to him, like tracks in the desert that dont match no animal you know.\n\nI tell this tale not just to speak on the wall between languages in our schools out here in California but to show how the obvious aint always obvious at all. Even a child speaking perfect English might find reading it like crossing a river in flood. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him them letters and sounds till they was familiar as his own face in the mirror. But for them children who barely speak English at all, that's a harder path to walk.\n\nAin't no single answer neither. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in using all of them together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching is good for all children, not just them that speak Spanish first. Studies show these children do better than their peers but folk still fear it like they fear what they dont understand. If we was to make this the rule instead of the exception, every child would profit from it. We dont need every teacher speaking two languages - that aint realistic. But we sure could use some special helpers who know both tongues, like scouts who know both sides of the border.",
            "From the time we are young they tell us there is something greater than ourselves out there in the vast dark. Something beyond knowing. The old ones send their young to houses of God built of wood and stone and glass where they learn tales passed down through time immemorial. Some take these stories into themselves like bread and water while others cast them away, declaring themselves alone in the void. We wander through our days seeking meaning in different vessels, different shapes, trading one truth for another like worn currency. All of us searching for that pale fire in the blackness that might lead us home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set in the failing light watching the rain beat against the tin roof, smoke rising from our cigarettes like lost prayers. Water ran in the gutters and drowned the flowers that mother had planted years ago. He looked out into the gray waste of evening with eyes that seemed to see both nothing and everything at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's rags, his skull showing through the thinning hair like something unearthed. We didnt speak. What words could fill such spaces. I moved closer and we watched the rain together while the day bled out into darkness.\n\nHe died in the winter. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him poison to fight the poison in his blood but it only stretched his suffering like a wire drawn too tight. I cursed God in the nighttime. Sat in rooms darker than any church and spoke no prayers to the emptiness. If there was something out there listening it had turned its face from us long ago.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not. The witnessing of such things marks a soul in ways that cant be unnamed. I wanted him alive in my memory not cold and white in some sterile room where machines counted down his last hours. They knew, all of them, that his only son would not stand vigil at his passing. I lay in my bed for three days like Jonah in the belly of the whale waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He was a man of the soil first and of politics second, this John Taylor of Caroline, and in him burned something fierce and righteous about the nature of freedom and the proper role of governance. The earth itself had shaped his thoughts on what a nation ought be, and from this came all else: his views on sovereignty and law and justice and the machinery of state.\n\nThe land was new then. Virgin territory for governance unmarred by the old ways that had poisoned the minds of men across the water. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever force breathed life into mankind were like links in an iron chain, break one and the whole thing falls to rust and ruin. These things, he reckoned, must stay beyond the reach of men who would rule other men.\n\nSome spoke of natural states where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, but Taylor knew civilization must rise above such base things. He carried within him a stark vision of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between. The government, he said, must account for both these forces dwelling in the hearts of men. Good was the protection of property and the cultivation of soil. Evil was the gathering of wealth through paper and promises. He knew that self-interest drove all men but saw how it could twist and corrupt, creating parasites who fed upon the labor of others.\n\nThe Constitution, he believed, must be read like scripture - strict but with wisdom. Let the federal government be small and bound by chains of paper and ink, for a fat government grows hungry and tyrannical. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be understood, the intentions of those who wrote it known. And above all else stood the Declaration, that first document which spoke of sovereign states joined in common cause but not merged into one great beast of governance.\n\nHe would have seen what was coming, this Caroline farmer. Would have watched the slow death of his agrarian dream with eyes that knew too well the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts when power called to them. But he planted his ideas like seeds in the furrows of a young nation's mind, and some took root and grow there still.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, thoughts coming and going unbidden and unbound by the constraints of consciousness until there was nothing left but the pure act of seeing.\n\nHe'd bought the book once. An art book. Some woman who wrote about the brain and how to make it draw what the eye sees true. She wrote of frames and squares and how to parse the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vast terrible everything of existence and cut it down to size. But there was no frame now. No square. Just the terrible brown truth of what lay before him.\n\nThe porcelain was white as bone. White as the skulls of dead things in the desert. He touched the silver handle with fingers that knew their purpose and watched the water spiral down like some primal force of nature. The brown mass stayed. Unmoved. Uncaring. Like something ancient buried in the earth that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nHe stood in his uniform. The green tie at his throat like a noose. The mop beside him like a companion in this strange ritual. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom cast no shadows and in their stark truth there was nowhere to hide from what must be done. He pulled at the paper on the wall, wrapping his hand like a man preparing for war, layer upon layer until the shape of his hand was lost in the whiteness. Then he reached down into the water the way a man reaches into his own past knowing there is no good thing to find there.\n\nThe water was cold. Cold as death. Cold as truth.",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their clean white coats say the young mind aint ready for such things. That it cannot grasp the weight of steel and speed and death that comes with it. But they drive all the same.\n\nThe inexperience sits in them like poison. Makes them roll vehicles that ought not roll. Makes them press pedals that ought not be pressed. Makes them leave roads that ought to be followed. And they travel in packs these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom that wolves carry in their blood. Some state men in California watched them die and counted the bodies and made charts of the dead showing how they died more when they ran together.\n\nThe state tried to fix it. Made papers that said when they could drive and who could ride with them. But papers dont stop blood from flowing when metal meets metal on the midnight highways. Papers dont make young minds old.\n\nSome doctor named Zuckerman he says even eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of it like addicts seeking poison. Says we ought to wait till the blood runs cooler in their veins. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there will be more of them. Children of the boomers coming up like dark clouds on the horizon ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nCould make a law about it. Simple thing really. Keep them learning in schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen years have passed. Make them prove themselves like California does with their fifty hours of watching and learning. Make it the same everywhere across this blood-soaked nation.\n\nAint nothing new in what I say. Just truth that sits there plain as death on a highway.",
            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder and it lives in the spaces between hearing and knowing. Not in the ear itself but in the dark corridors of the brain where sound becomes meaning. Like a demon that steals understanding from the minds of those afflicted leaving them whole in body but fractured in comprehension.\n\nThe disorder moves through three territories and we will walk them all. First the nature of the thing itself. Then the marking of its presence in the afflicted, the signs writ in behavior and confusion that herald its existence. Last the methods by which those who teach might aid the cursed ones in rooms full of the blessed.\n\nIt began in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with names like Bocca and Calearo hunting for understanding in the minds of children who could hear but could not listen. They created tests. Mapped the territories of confusion. In 1977 they gathered, these searchers of broken sound, to share their dark knowledge.\n\nThe disorder manifests like a ghost in the machine of consciousness. Some cannot locate sound in space as if the world were flat and dimensionless. Some cannot parse the difference between sounds that fall like rain upon their ears. Some cannot hear the mockery in a voice or the anger beneath soft words. The sounds come but meaning dies stillborn in the mind.\n\nThey test for it now with machines and questionnaires and observations recorded in careful hands. Audiologists and speech pathologists move through the darkness of the affliction with their instruments like blind men with sticks, tapping at the walls of comprehension. They send sounds into the ear like scouts into enemy territory and measure what returns. But no single test can capture its presence fully. The disorder remains elusive, like smoke in a closed room, its origins unknown, its territory mapped but never fully conquered.",
            "They were the lost ones. The broken ones. Children with eyes like empty wells and families splintered like old wood left too long in the sun. I knew them before I knew their names. Knew their stories written in bruises and silence. The social work, it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night.\n\nService and respect aint just words writ on paper. They're carved deep in the bone. In the marrow. Ethics aint something you learn from books neither. You carry it or you dont.\n\nI wandered them halls of learning for years, watching them young ones flee from their demons. Some found poison in the bottle, others in the needle. After Piedmont College in 09 I drifted like smoke until that summer day when fate showed its hand. There was this boy. Sixteen maybe. Sitting scared on my friend's couch like a sparrow in a thunderstorm. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave scars deeper than skin.\n\nI went to their house. The law was there already, blue lights cutting through the twilight like cold stars. Told them what I knew. What I'd learned in them psychology books. They asked me to talk to the parents and I did. Heard their excuses like bitter wind through dead trees. Simple disputes, they called it. Simple. Nothing simple about terror in a child's eyes.\n\nJustice. That's what they say we got but it aint true. Society wants its people to follow like sheep. Wants em numbered and counted and sorted. But I seen different. Seen the truth of it. In school I fought against their rules like a wolf fights against the trap. Colored my hair wild colors that nature never dreamed of. Marked my flesh with metal. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Gay. Straight. Bisexual. All God's creatures carrying their own truth.\n\nRacism and hate, they're like poison in the well. Been fighting against em since I could stand. Still am. Always will be. That's the path I chosen. Or maybe it chosen me. Either way, here I am, walking toward them dark places where children cry in the night, carrying whatever light I got left to give.",
            "Sleep comes unbidden like a thief in the night or it doesnt come at all. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like some dark totem carved from the bones of sleepless nights, its shadow cast long across the biological and sociocultural planes of human understanding. They who study such things speak of models and methods, of inherited traits passed down through blood and bone, and of the world that shapes us like wind shapes stone.\n\nThe categorization of sleep's absence comes in three forms, each more merciless than the last. Primary disorders stand alone like sentinels in the night. Others walk hand in hand with the demons of the mind, those axis disorders that plague mankind since time immemorial. And still others come from the poison we put in our bodies or the failing of our mortal shells.\n\nIn the realm of primary disorders there are the Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, names given by men in white coats to the horrors that stalk the night. Insomnia, that cruel mistress, denies sleep to those who seek it. Hypersomnia, her sister, drags men down into unwanted slumber like stones beneath dark water. Narcolepsy strikes like a serpent, sudden and without mercy. The Parasomnias bring their own terrors - nightmares that tear through the mind like wolves through flesh, sleep terrors that freeze the blood, and sleepwalking that sends the unconscious body wandering through the dark hours.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the microscopic spaces between life and death, neurons fire like distant stars. They carry orexin, the messenger of wake and sleep, through channels as old as time itself. The scientists, they found these things in mice first. GABAB receptors, they called them, gatekeepers of consciousness. When they opened these gates with their chemicals and medicines, sleep came like a flood. But nature is cruel and what works in mice may not work in men. The inheritance of such mechanisms through bloodlines means some are born to wander the night while others sleep sound in their beds.",
            "Been here two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters in this place they call University Park where the wind howls cold across empty spaces between buildings and the snow falls sideways like God's own spite. Started out in East Halls, far as you could go before hitting wilderness and stadium concrete. Stuart Hall was home then. Twenty-five minutes walking to Willard through weather that'd freeze the heart of hell itself. That's how it goes in State College.\n\nTalked once to someone who'd been here before. Not much older but spoke of different times. Said East Halls stood alone then, separated by vast emptiness like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields and buildings rise up from that emptiness. New Creamery. New health building. Apartments sprout like weeds in cracked earth. Campus grows like some living thing, stretching, expanding, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nThe bicycle. That's what saves you here. Simple machine of steel and rubber but it needs more than just existing. Needs riders. Needs paths. Needs purpose.\n\nFriend of mine found his way back to cycling after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. Nothing else like it for getting around, he said, fashion be damned. Bowl of oatmeal becomes thirty miles of freedom. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm ever was. Bought a bike. Best thing I done. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from where I sleep. On the bike, five minutes if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it ain't friendly. Not to bikes. Not to nothing really.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time ain't one of them. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in wind. More when you count everything else needs doing. Time's a currency can't be borrowed back once spent. Bike saves what little I got left of it.",
            "They had come to see what the old man Huxley had writ about the machines and the money and how they worked together like serpents in the dark. In his book about the brave world that was to come he showed them people who lived not as ones but as many, folks who sought nothing but the quick pleasure of the moment like animals rutting in the field. And above them all stood the Controller like some dark god, moving his pieces across a board none could see.\n\nThe dead prophets of old had spoke of such things. Marx and his ilk who saw how the powerful made the weak believe lies about their own chains. In this new world they had built the people were less than cattle, branded and sorted by letters like freight in a trainyard. Deltas. Gammas. Names that meant nothing and everything. They filled their heads with whispered commands while they slept, telling them to spend and want and need until there wasnt nothing left inside them that was their own.\n\nWeren't no real love in this place neither. The people moved through their days like ghosts, touching but never feeling, speaking but never saying. The men talked of women like they was discussing livestock, measuring their worth in flesh and curves they called pneumatic. The women were no better, trading stories of their rutting like they was discussing the weather. Each class of folk stayed in their place like it was writ in stone, believing the lies they'd been fed since before they could walk. They consumed and obeyed and never looked up to see the bars of their cage, thinking themselves free while wearing chains they'd been taught to love.\n\nThe Controller watched it all from his high tower, knowing what Marx knew - that if you tell a man he's special while you rob him blind, he'll thank you for the privilege. And so they went on, all of them, dancing to music they couldn't hear, played by hands they couldn't see.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The question hung in the air like woodsmoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since the towers fell have shifted like desert sands, the wind of public opinion blowing first one way then another, media voices crying hostility then tolerance in equal measure. Now we stand in a time where a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his lineage, could reach for the highest seat in the land. Such things were not dreamt of in the days when the towers still stood.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. It moves against what history whispers, like two streams flowing contrary. I had known Muhammad as a conqueror, a man who bent tribes to his will and branded their souls with his faith through steel and fire. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of men until they saw truth in his words and came crawling through the dust to drink from his wisdom. \n\nThey write of miracles that echo like mockingbirds singing borrowed songs. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes, feeding forty when it should have fed few. The writers craft their prophet in borrowed robes, dressing him in the cast-off garments of the Nazarene. They diminish Christ's glory by making their prophet wear his face like a mask.\n\nTheir stories come wrapped in layers of telling, each voice more distant than the last. They say this man told that man who heard from another, words passing through countless mouths like water through too many vessels, each one losing something in the pouring. They meant these tellings to be proof but they stand as hollow as desert bones bleached by sun and time.\n\nWhat gnaws at the mind is how they shape him soft and holy, this Muhammad. A gentle soul dispensing wisdom like morning dew. But history tells another tale, written in blood and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true shape of the man whose name they praise. The past carries its own truth, and no amount of gentle words can wash the blood from its pages.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of history while they marched forward with their own designs. The truth of it lay bare and bleeding in the centuries that followed, each generation stepping further from the source like concentric rings in dead water. Yet now something stirs in the minds of men. Some ancient knowing. The old guard stands fast with their dogma but their numbers thin like shadows at noon.\n\nThe Christians will remember. They will look back across the waste of years and see what was lost. What was added. Layer upon layer of doctrine like rust on pure metal. It may take generations, maybe more, but time bends back on itself like a snake eating its tail. They'll strip away the accumulated weight of centuries, peeling back the years like old paint until nothing remains but the raw wood of his words, unvarnished and true.\n\nWhen this knowing sweeps across the old countries like wildfire, burning away the chaff of centuries, the church will abide. But it will be changed. The countless branches of belief will draw together like scattered cattle before a storm. The differences between them will blur and fade like old photographs left in the sun. Unity will rise from diversity like a phoenix from ash.\n\nHistory moves in great circles. The Romans who fed Christians to lions knelt before crosses in time. The land that chains broke now bears black leaders. And so too will Christianity circle back to its source, seeking truth in the bones of its beginning. They'll read his words anew, not as stone tablets but as living things, metaphors breathing in the mind.\n\nBefore all this there was only Judaism. Before Rome planted its eagles in Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the pillars. But even then the people split like light through crystal - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who walked between them all.",
            "The darkness that dwells in men's hearts aint no mystery and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Like wolves they are, prowling through the night, seeking only their own fortunes and caring nothing for the weak that fall beneath their feet. The book lays it bare and cold and true.\n\nYou see it most in them factory bosses, them kings of industry who sit high in their towers of brick and iron. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, their only god being the almighty dollar. Sinclair writes of how them buildings stood against the sky like ancient ruins, dark towers belching forth rivers of smoke that stretched on forever into the void, as if hell itself had opened its maw upon the earth. The owners, they didnt care none about what their machines did to the air or how their waste poisoned the ground. The rivers ran thick with blood and offal from ten thousand beasts, but profit was their only truth.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Expendable. Replaceable. Like Sinclair says, the whole place was nothing but a cauldron of hate, where a man's worth was measured only in coins. They'd work a man till his hands bled and his spirit broke, then cast him aside like a spent shell casing. No warning. No mercy. Just the cold mathematics of greed.\n\nIn them days there weren't no laws to protect the weak. No safety nets. No guardian angels. The factory was a beast that fed on flesh and bone, grinding up immigrants and poor folk alike in its terrible machinery. Them that lived in Packingtown was caught in a web of misery with no escape, like flies in a spider's web. The unions that claimed to help was just another kind of parasite, feeding off the desperation of them that had nothing left to give.\n\nThey called it progress but it was slavery by another name. As Sinclair put it, them foreign folk and poor people was hanging by a thread, their very existence dependent on the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And just like them ancient slavers, these modern masters bred the same rot in men's souls, the same darkness that turns brother against brother and makes monsters of men.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Word was he took to writing bout some place called Thulé, twice marking it in his verses like a man marking the start and end of his territory. Virgil knew of this place too, wrote of it in times long past, called it an island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness. But there was something else, something closer to our time that bore watching.\n\nPoe had himself a powerful thirst for German writing, deep and relentless as any desert wanderer. There was this man Goethe, wrote himself a thing called Faust, published in two pieces like a broken mirror, first part in 1808, second when death came calling for him in 32. Inside that second piece lay hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé they called it. Story goes of a king whose woman died leaving him nothing but a goblet and memories that drove him to drink. Grief ate at him like rust on iron till he gave everything away save that cup, walked himself to the edge of the world and cast it into the black waters below, then closed his eyes for the last time.\n\nYou can see the shadows of one man's writing in the other's, like blood seeping through floorboards. Both speaking of loss and drink and darkness. Both walking through lands where the sun fears to tread. Poe took that word Thulé and made it his own in The Pit and Pendulum, then again in Dreamland, bookending his verses like a man marking his grave at both ends.\n\nIn Dreamland the speaker wanders through a world stripped of color, haunted by ghosts of them that's gone before, like some dark mirror of Goethe's grieving king. Both men, separated by ocean and years, writing bout the same darkness, same loneliness, same weight of memory that drives men to drink and death.\n\nWeren't no accident neither. Poe knew Goethe's work like a man knows the scars on his own hands. Had to, being the kind that followed Tennyson's writings close as a shadow. The German's words was everywhere in them days, spreading like wildfire through the minds of them that read, and Poe, he was always one to watch the flames.",
            "The law speaks of malice and punishment in the sunbaked streets of California where a woman fell and broke herself upon the tiled floor of a market. The floor gleamed wet with spilled applesauce like some pale blood of commerce and the manager sat in his office eating his dinner while the world turned and customers walked the aisles unwarned.\n\nThey had told him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan coming to his door like prophets of some minor doom and he had turned them away with words about time and dinner and things that could wait. But things that wait carry their own judgment and at half past five Palmer found the slick spot that waited patient as a snake and fell. Her back broke or near enough to it. The fifth such falling in that year alone, as if the store itself hungered for broken bodies upon its floor.\n\nThe question of punishment lies cold as stone in the hands of judges who must weigh despicable acts against the letter of civil code. Section 3294 speaks of malice like some ancient text, defining the darkness in men's hearts when they know the danger that waits and yet do nothing. The manager knew. He had seen five others fall in that same year, their bodies marking the calendar of his negligence like stations of some retail cross.\n\nThe courts have spoken before of such things. In Taylor they drew the lines between simple failure and willful disregard, between accident and malice. They spoke of men who see the consequences coming like dark riders on the horizon and choose to let them ride. The manager saw them coming. Twice warned and twice he waved them on, choosing his dinner over the safety of those who walked his aisles in trust.\n\nThe law will not dismiss this easily. It will weigh the manager's indifference against the broken body of Palmer and find there something more than simple neglect. Something that speaks of conscious choice and willing blindness to consequence. Something that carries the weight of punishment beyond mere compensation.",
            "The wanting had been there always. A void that would not fill. It came upon her in her fourteenth year like some dark spirit that takes hold and will not loose its grip and even now three years hence it remained steadfast and cruel in its persistence. She knew now it was not a thing she sought but a someone and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They came to her with their fumbling advances and their awkward words but she felt nothing. She questioned this strangeness in herself, this absence of desire that seemed to mark her different from other girls her age. Years of thinking on it had yielded nothing but hollow theories that crumbled like ash in her hands.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through life like two leaves carried by the same stream, never quarreling, never raising voices except when their daughter's wild spirit threatened to break free of their gentle waters. She was their opposite, full of light and motion, drawing others to her like moths to flame yet carrying in her heart a kindness that made her beloved by all who knew her.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried death in its teeth. She wandered the rooms seeking something unnamed when her mother's scream cut through the silence like a blade. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain twisting her face into something ancient and terrible. Mama, she said. Mama what's wrong. The words came broken and gasping. Hospital, her mother said. Take me. The girl lifted her mother like a child, thankful for the strength in her arms that she had built over years. She carried her to the car and laid her in the back like some precious cargo and drove through streets that seemed suddenly foreign and hostile.\n\nThe hospital rose before them like a white monument to suffering. Inside the air hung thick with chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to the woman in her arms. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling a narrow bed between them. They took her mother away down corridors that seemed to stretch into forever and left her alone with her thoughts in a plastic chair that had held countless others before her, all waiting, all afraid.\n\nLater they would tell her how her mother had reached for something beautiful, a simple vase high up where such things are kept, and how the stool had betrayed her like all simple things sometimes do.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistical dark. Not the diet of their fathers but something older still. Plant foods and fish flesh and the oils that run golden, not white like the rendered fats of beasts. The drink too, measured and portioned like sacrament.\n\nThey had seen it before in other studies, dark auguries in the data that showed how death came slower to those who followed the old ways. The heart's betrayals less frequent, the body's weight held in check. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that thief of mind and movement.\n\nThey gathered their witchcraft of numbers from seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, all nurses, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. None had the sugar sickness nor the heart's early warnings. For twenty years they watched and waited, gathering their testimonies six times over, asking what passed their lips and in what measure. The women marked their papers faithful as penitents, year after year, more than nineteen in twenty staying true to the cause.\n\nWhen death came they searched the records, the cold files of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable, lacking the certainty of paper proof, but these too they counted in their ledger of loss. They weighed all things: the smoke in their lungs, the pills they took, the blood that ceased its monthly flow, the sweat of their leisure hours.\n\nThrough machines that counted and sorted they fed their numbers, adjusting for the chaos of living, for age and smoke and flesh and movement. And in the end the truth came clear as bones in desert sand. Those who followed closest the Mediterranean way, they died less from the heart's failings and the brain's dark floods. In numbers it showed: two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts stopped or wounded, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke's shadow, one thousand seventy-seven souls taken by the combined assault of heart and brain.\n\nThe numbers spoke their truth. Those who ate as the ancients ate, they lived longer than their sisters who did not. This was the power of old wisdom written in modern blood.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign reads. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stands at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old. Dark ink bleeding into the corrupted pulp. Burma they call it now though names mean nothing in such places where men with guns make their own truth. Since sixty-two the soldiers have ruled there, taking power like thieves in the night, their boots echoing down empty streets where democracy once walked.\n\nThey came in saffron robes, the monks did. Walking the streets like fire made flesh, their procession a silent scream against the military that ruled their world. At first the government let them be but violence has its own gravity and soon enough the night was filled with the sound of splintering temple doors and the wet thud of rifle butts against flesh. The foreign writers disappeared into concrete cells or wooden boxes. A Japanese man named Nagai bled out on the street, his camera still clicking as his life leaked away into the dust.\n\nThirteen dead they say. But the colonel who fled speaks of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle night. The truth of it lost to the darkness like so many truths before.\n\nThese things are old as time itself. Rome's emperors claimed divine right while they burned the world. The sons of heaven rule Japan still, their divinity unchanged by cars and computers and ritual death. Here in our own land the president speaks to holy men who sell salvation like carnival barkers hawking painted shells.\n\nThe stories repeat. Tiananmen Square ran red while tanks ground students into the pavement. Rwanda's machetes flashed in the sun as neighbor killed neighbor. Hitler's ovens burned day and night until the sky itself turned gray with ash.\n\nAnd still we stand here, holding signs against the darkness, as if paper and ink could stop bullets and hate.",
            "The ghost of Duke Ellington haunts the halls of jazz like some dark specter that won't lay down to rest, his presence carved deep into the bones of music by years that stretched longer than most men dare dream. At the piano his touch was light as morning dew but in the composition of sound he was more akin to some mad architect building cathedrals of brass and wood and breath. He knew the souls of his players like a father knows his sons and he built frameworks of notes wherein they could wander free as wild horses or march strict as soldiers depending on what the music called for.\n\nThe sound lived in him and through him and he knew how to make it speak in tongues both strange and beautiful. Each player was a color on his palette and he painted with them all, making pictures in the air that no man had seen before and few since have matched. The dictionary men speak of something called Creole Love Call where he took the human voice and stripped it bare of words, leaving only pure sound like some primal thing that crawled up from the swamp of time.\n\nThe piece moves like this: First comes the voice pure as spring water calling out to reeds that answer back, the voice growing rough like old leather toward the end. Then a trumpet muted and crying blue notes into the darkness. A clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The whole band takes up the call then, brass and reeds speaking back and forth like lovers in the night. At the height of it all the reeds cry out high and wild while brass and rhythm punch holes in time itself. Then back to the beginning it goes, voice and reeds once more, but now the voice has learned to growl like some beast that's found its way into church. It ends with a woman's voice running wild and a trombone speaking blasphemy.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin, trumpet singing like a man and voice playing like brass. Later in It Don't Mean a Thing he let Nanton loose with that muted trombone of his, and if there's any sound in this world that can tell you what a soul in torment sounds like, that's the one.",
            "The shells carry their own mathematics, though men have long stood dumb before their geometries. In 1917 Thompson spoke true when he said that no zoologist had yet dreamed in the language of numbers what nature had wrought in bone and calcium, and his words echo still across the century like the voice of some dead prophet.\n\nThe mollusks build their homes in spiral paths through time and space, each revolution marking another turn in their blind journey through existence. These whorls, as men name them, spiral around an axis that ain't there except in theory, like the pole star that guides men through darkness but exists only in their minds. The columella stands as the spine of the thing, anchoring each whorl to the next in an ancient agreement between flesh and mineral.\n\nWe took their ghosts in X-ray light and fed their numbers to machines that could speak their language. The software called CerioShell consumed these measurements like some digital oracle, spitting forth predictions of forms that might be or might have been. We sought to understand the boundaries of what could exist, as if mapping the territories between the possible and impossible.\n\nThe shell grows like a testament to time itself, each revolution marking another cycle in the endless wheel of life and death. The suture line divides yesterday from today, while the body whorl stands as the final chapter in the creature's autobiography writ in calcium. The spire reaches upward like the tower of some prehistoric babel, its apex pointing toward heaven or whatever lies beyond.\n\nThrough the aperture the living thing reaches out into the world, that opening like a door between two realms - one of flesh and one of stone. We studied these shells from every angle - apical, basal, apertural - seeking in their symmetries some truth about the laws that govern all living things.\n\nTo count the whorls is to count chapters in a book written in the language of survival. Draw a line where the first suture begins and follow it through space like tracking the path of a star across the night sky. Each quarter turn tells its own story.\n\nThe mathematics of their existence can be captured, contained in formulae that describe the path of that opening through space and time. But numbers alone cant tell the whole truth of it. They are like marks on a map that show the way but not the journey.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers on the page. Ten years gone and the dead babies in Indonesia lay just as numerous as before, small corpses in their mothers' arms like broken birds. The country had met some of its promises, water flowing cleaner now through pipes and sewers, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same. The reasons lay scattered like bones in the sand, waiting to be counted.\n\nIn the villages and towns the midwives came more often now, seven births in ten seeing their weathered hands. But these women, these healers of old ways, stood powerless when the blood came too fast and too much, when death rode in on a crimson tide. The numbers spoke false comfort. And fewer children with the bloody flux saw proper doctors now, their mothers carrying them home to wait out their fever dreams, some to wake and some to sleep eternal.\n\nThe knife-birth, the cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. Four in hundred mothers felt its mercy. In the cities it came more often, seven mothers in hundred saved by the blade, but in the far places only two. The poor watched their sisters die while the rich lived on, a gap wide as twenty-seven graves between them. Money spoke here as it spoke everywhere, deciding who lived and who returned to dust.\n\nThey argued now about the path forward, whether to build towers of specific care or strengthen the whole edifice of healing. The targeted way beckoned like a mirage, promising quick victory, but carried poison in its heart. When money flowed to one wound, others festered untended. The helpers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving other sufferers to their fate. And in their haste they built parallel roads to the same destination, wasting precious time with papers and forms, duplicate wheels spinning in the sand while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like kudzu in summer heat, sprawling across a hundred years of human sound until no man could count its tendrils or name its parts. Within its vast territory lay kingdoms of sound - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk - but these too had split and divided like cells beneath a microscope, spawning bastard children that grew teeth and claws of their own.\n\nAmong these dark offspring Heavy Metal stood tallest, most terrible in its beauty. For forty years it had grown and mutated, showing faces both beautiful and grotesque, faces that spoke of rage and despair and sometimes joy though mostly it dwelt in shadows. The darkness called to others and they came, bearing guitars like weapons, and each who came carved out their own territory in the night until the territories became uncountable.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured, its boundaries fluid as mercury. What it is or aint no one can rightly say. It drinks deep from other wells of sound but its origins remain, black as pitch and twice as thick. To know the metal you must know its heart, must understand that it aint just music but a movement of souls through darkness.\n\nThe movement feeds on excess like a fever. More bass more volume more violence more theater until the ears bleed and the mind screams. Them that play it are masters of their craft, fingers flying across strings like spiders weaving webs of sound. In the seventies they found the drugs, or the drugs found them, and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like messages from some terrible heaven. It spoke truths other music dared not speak, reaching into places where light feared to go. Some say it draws power from them old Romantic composers, them that knew the darkness before electricity gave it voice. The proof's in the words they sing, black poetry that bleeds onto the page.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they maybe didn't mean to open. That song carried the sickness in it, the up-and-down fever dream of chemical paradise. Some call it the first real Metal song, though it was just them trying to outdo them Rolling Stones, to prove they could walk in darkness too. They put it on that white album like a black seed in white soil, never knowing what would grow from it.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their canvases of madness there was another who walked alone in the gardens of his mind. Rousseau was his name and he painted what he saw there. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this vision of a woman lost in some verdant paradise, though it was more than that. It was his own yearning made manifest, his hunger for acclaim that gnawed at him like some desperate animal.\n\nHe carried within him two warring spirits. One whispered of conformity, of following the paths others had worn smooth with their passing. The other spoke of wildness, of walking where none had walked before. These spirits clashed and bled within him all the days of his life.\n\nThe man himself came into the world in Laval, a town in the French northwest, in the year 1844. His father worked metal and sold hardware and knew something of comfort though not of wealth. The boy grew without learning the ways of art, became instead a collector of tolls for the state until he had seen forty winters pass. They called him douanier though this was wrong, he being merely a gabelou, a distinction that mattered little to any but those who wore such titles.\n\nDeath stalked him as it stalks all men but showed particular cruelty in taking eight of his children before they drew more than a handful of breaths each. Then it took his wife Clémence leaving him with only the girl Julia and a grief that sat in him like stone. He turned to painting then as a drowning man turns to any floating thing, hoping it might bear his weight and carry him to some distant shore.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. Matisse and others were rising then, their stars ascending while he labored in obscurity. Matisse feared the common and fought against it with every stroke of his brush while Rousseau sought it like a lover, thinking perhaps that in perfect conformity he might find perfect acceptance. But the heart wants what it wants and his brush followed paths of its own choosing, leading him through strange forests of the mind where no other had ventured.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions across the wasteland of mans thoughts. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, that beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things we learn come from books or the hard ways of life but these twin riders of truth and beauty they come to us like ghosts in the night unbidden and unexplained. We dont learn them so much as recognize them like the face of someone we knew before we were born.\n\nYou can talk about what makes something right or beautiful but you'll never catch its soul in your words. Like trying to describe the Mona Lisa. You can go on about shadow and light and what them Italian painters was thinking but in the end its just wind. People look at something beautiful and they say theres just something about it and then they try to explain but the explaining aint never enough. Same with whats right and wrong. OConnor knew it. Said you tell stories cause regular words wont do. Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics was beyond telling.\n\nThe connection twixt right and beautiful runs deeper than most think. Both of them hit you in places you cant name, like getting struck by lightning but the burns aint visible. Literature carries this burden more than other arts cause it deals in the currency of human souls. McKean wrote that moral standards might not matter much to music but they matter to stories like they matter to life itself. Stories traffic in values like a merchant trades in gold and the values is what makes them precious to us.\n\nWe recognize the truth of this like we recognize the shadow of death. It aint something you can point to or measure with any tools made by man. Its just there, waiting in the dark corners of our understanding, patient as stones, eternal as the desert night.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient beast from the earth, its spine the alps at München stretching north through darkness and light to where the Baltic waters lap at Kiel's cold shores. This same spirit moves through the land like blood through veins, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds dark and knowing. That such a thing should come from many sources surprises no man who knows the way of tribes and blood and earth.\n\nGermania. The name itself carries weight like old bones in the ground, disputed by men who claim to know its truth but find only shadows. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, their name changing like wind-blown sand from German to something else, something older. Caesar too spoke the word Germanus in his writings of war and conquest, taking it from Gaulish tongues to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of spears or of shouting, but such meanings are lost now like footprints in snow.\n\nIn the year ninety-eight Tacitus put down in words what he knew of these people, claiming them pure as winter water, untouched by the mixing of blood that marked other lands. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern shores for this wild country with its gray skies and darker woods, unless it were already written in their blood?\n\nThe Romans came but did not stay, their armies moving like shadows across the land, taking what they would and retreating south again to their marble halls and painted walls. The Germanic tribes lived in the spaces between, trading what the forest gave them, selling their strength to Roman generals who knew the worth of men who had grown strong in hard places. They lived thus on the edge of empire, neither fully in nor fully out, like wolves at the firelight's edge.",
            "In the dark theater of deception that is Twelfth Night there runs a truth cold and stark as winter bone. That a mask once worn becomes more than mere covering but a second skin that must be torn away lest it consume the wearer whole. And in the tearing there is blood and there are those who would turn away from such revelation.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own particular poison. What darkness in the soul drives one to shed their given form and take up another. For Viola the answer comes like a whispered prayer in the night. Preservation. Survival. The ancient instinct of prey. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke.\n\nShe walks the path of manhood and finds herself cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. A lone wolf in sheep's clothing. And the deception breeds its own complications dark and twisted as roots beneath the earth. Olivia's heart turns toward this false man with the fervor of religious conversion. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead leaves. And there is Orsino too whose own desires wreath around Viola like thorned vines: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nPerhaps to modern eyes the play speaks to deeper truths buried beneath custom and propriety like bones beneath soil. The deception acts as spade turning earth revealing what lies beneath. Olivia's passion for Cesario might speak to hidden waters running deep but more likely stands as Shakespeare's mirror held up to those who would judge the book by its binding. This truth reveals itself when she turns from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a snake striking, claiming the disguised Viola not as lover but blood: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words final as a coffin lid closing.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing that carried with it the weight of genocide and the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples who walked those scorched plains. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and that's the truth of it.\n\nIn the east where the land was green they left behind them educated men who could read and write and cipher and when the British came in 1919 they found these men and knew their worth. In Kamerun too they done the same and visitors wrote of it with approval in their books.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. Different in a way that cant be explained by simple tellings. While the government built schools in the east and taught the natives there, in the southwest they gave that task to the missionaries and gave them little help besides. Yet they poured money like water into schools for the white children, both government schools and mission schools alike. These choices echoed long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their mark in the world, in South West Africa most remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe land itself told part of the tale. It was a hard country, mostly desert, but with enough temperance in its climate to draw white settlers like moths to flame. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand souls, three times more than lived in East Africa which was the next most settled of their lands. The settlers came and with them came their notions and their prejudices and their fears, and these things shaped the way the teaching was done or wasnt done, depending on whose children needed learning.\n\nThe old books tell of this time, most wrote in German when the empire still stood or in the years right after. Later came the English writers who looked deeper, compared one place to another, sought to understand why things were done the way they were done. A man named Cohen wrote of it, of how the settlers changed everything, though maybe he didnt see all the darkness that lay beneath.",
            "Blood and dust marked the path between these two nations, stretching fifty-seven years across the scarred earth like a wound that would not heal. The republic to the north and the republic to the south, each eyeing the other across that vast expanse of desert and mountain where men died nameless deaths beneath an indifferent sun.\n\nThey fought their war in forty-six, the Americans coming down like locusts, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in a storm of gunpowder and manifest destiny. But the war was just the center of it. Before and after there were skirmishes and raids, men crossing invisible lines drawn by men who had never seen the land they divided. The people of these nations carried old hatreds like sacred relics, passed down from Spanish galleons and English sailing ships, from cathedrals and protestant churches where each cursed the other's god in different tongues.\n\nThe border between them was like a rope pulled taut, vibrating with tension. Such is the way of nations that share earth and sky but not blood or belief. The Americans looked south and saw papistry and monarchy, things their grandfathers had fled across an ocean to escape. The Mexicans looked north and saw heretics and usurpers, come to take what was never theirs to claim.\n\nBandits and raiders moved across this divide like wraiths, striking at settlements and vanishing back across the line, caring nothing for flags or treaties. Seventeen times the nations clashed in those years, each clash marked in ledgers and books but written truly in blood on the desert floor. The raids continued until both armies came to the frontier, and even then the peace was bought with steel and lead.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like all things born of hate and fear. Mexico bent like a reed in an American wind, and the northern republic's hunger changed from land to gold, from conquest to commerce. But the memory of those years lies still in the earth, in the bones of the nameless dead, in the wind that blows across two nations that once stained the desert red.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some primitive need for safety, the kind that was absent in my youth. They'd say you'll always find work, always have bread, for the sick and dying never cease their coming. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing, though it healed nothing in me.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone and alone, pockets empty as a desert well, body betraying every command. Still am. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I owned has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war, its own assault on what little certainty remains. Nothing solid to grasp except one truth: without the blood-bonds of family and the handful who stayed, I'd have been dust. When the real darkness comes, ain't nobody feels strong.\n\nLife brings its calamities, big and small, like storm clouds gathering on a horizon you can't outrun. No matter how you fortify against it, some tempests are too mighty to weather alone.\n\nThese United States need weaning from the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust our own kind again, to reach out hands both ways - helping and accepting help - than each soul digging their own hole to hide in.\n\nThey speak of rugged individualism like it's gospel, but what kept our ancestors breathing wasn't the lone wolf spirit. It was breaking bread together, sharing what little they had, knowing a neighbor's need was your own. Them wagon trains that crossed the Rockies didn't make it on solitary courage.\n\nBe ready, sure. Got my own cache of supplies - medical stuff, water tablets, window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Got light for the darkness and food for the hunger. If you've got land to work and knowledge to preserve its bounty, do it. Ain't no shame in preparation.\n\nBut while you're stocking up, learn your neighbor's name. Might be the most important preparation of all.",
            "In the ancient times before Christ walked the earth there was born a prince who would come to be known as Buddha and he walked the earth and saw the suffering of men and cast off his worldly possessions like a snake sheds its skin and found enlightenment in the barren places where men go to die. And from his teachings came forth Buddhism and chief among its sects was Theravada and it endured through the centuries like a stone worn smooth by water. Twenty five hundred years have passed and the religion has changed like all things must change and you can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year and the monks and common folk gather though Buddha spoke nothing of such things in his time. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony and reach into the very marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have altered their sacred principles as time passed like wind reshaping the desert and these changes came from within and without like thieves in the night some bearing knives and some bearing nothing at all.\n\nThey speak of forces internal and external like twin serpents coiled around the faith. The internal force rises from those who call themselves Buddhist be they monk or layman and the external comes from those who stand outside the faith like wolves at the edge of firelight. And some forces come with malice burning in their hearts seeking to tear down what Buddha built and these they call hostile while others neither help nor harm but move through the world like dust storms that care nothing for what lies in their path and these they call benign.\n\nAt its heart the faith holds certain truths like ancient bones buried in deep earth. They seek shelter in three things: the Buddha himself and the Dhamma which is the word and the Sangha which is the community of faithful. The word is kept in three vessels they call pitakas and these contain all manner of things from rules to stories to the nature of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of there being no soul and of suffering that clings to life like smoke to cloth and of how nothing lasts and nothing stays and all things must pass away. Only by knowing these truths can a man break free from the wheel of death and rebirth that turns eternal like a millstone grinding souls to dust. And when enlightenment comes it burns away desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds men's minds. They have rules for living both for the common man who must not kill or lie or steal or rut like beasts or poison his mind with strong drink and for the monks who carry heavier burdens still. But above all else they hold to four noble truths that speak of suffering and its causes and its end like a map leading out of darkness."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The logic winds tight as a snare, but catches nothing substantial. Faith, they call it in their books and temples. Faith like a flame in darkness.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He believed God could be proven like a theorem, laid bare under the knife of reason until the truth bled out clear as morning.

            "Words carry weight and writers know this truth deep in their bones. They wield their implements like knives, cutting meaning from the void. Some cut deeper than others. Fitzgerald knew this and in The Great Gatsby he carved his meanings with precision, though perhaps he did not know the fullness of what he wrought. He would take words that had no business laying together and force them into an unholy union, creating something new and terrible and beautiful.

            "There's a thing between brothers that ain't natural and ain't made by man. It's older than blood and deeper than bone. It carries love and pride and mean things too, things that have no name but live in the dark spaces between heartbeats. Brothers know each other like they know their own face in still water, seeing themselves in the other's eyes like some terrible mirror that shows truth instead of reflection.\n\nWhen the world turns wrong and everything goes black as pitch, that's when you see what kind of bond holds. Good or evil, it don't matter. It just is. And whatever comes of it carries a price that must be paid in full. No credit given, no promises accepted. Just cold payment in whatever coin the world demands.\n\nIn the story they call The Scarlet Ibis there's these two brothers walking through a world green and wet and full of things dying. The older one, he's got pride eating at him like rust on iron, and the younger one, Doodle, he's born wrong, fragile as a bird's bones. They set out on a fool's errand through swamps where old women's ghosts still walk, and only one comes back breathing.\n\nThe older brother, he wanted what couldn't be had. Wanted to teach running and climbing and all manner of things to a boy whose heart was weak as water. Wanted someone to race through the pinewoods to Horsehead Landing, wanted someone to sit high in the trees where the wind lives. But you can't make a racing horse from a broken-legged colt, and he knew it. The knowing ate at him worse than the wanting.\n\nThere was a time he looked at that baby brother and thought about sending him to Jesus with a pillow. Thought about it like a man thinks about killing a wounded animal. But the baby smiled and something in that smile reached down into whatever dark place that killing thought came from and pulled out something like love instead. Even if he didn't know it was love at the time. Even if he wouldn't know it until it was too late.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and twisted thing, a labyrinth of flesh and electricity that moves like God's own clockwork through the skull. In the old days they said it was like wax that could be marked upon, then paper, then books bound in leather, and now they speak of machines that think in ones and zeros, but all these things are just shadows on a wall, poor reflections of the truth that lies beneath.\n\nThe world comes in through gates of flesh. Light and sound and heat, all of them transformed into something else, something that runs like lightning through the corridors of the brain. They called it processing, as if the mind was some kind of slaughterhouse for reality. The signals move up and down like spirits in a house, bottom to top and top to bottom. Take a black box sitting on white. The eye sees edges first, boundaries where darkness meets light, and the mind builds it up piece by piece like a carpenter working in reverse. Then from above comes knowledge, memory, expectation. The box becomes more than shapes. It becomes real.\n\nThere's a guardian in there too, watching, deciding what matters and what don't. You might be standing in grass up to your ankles but your mind won't count each blade unless it has to. But hear your name spoke across a crowded room and something in you turns like a wolf hearing prey in the distance.\n\nThe mind keeps its treasures like a crow keeps bright things, storing them away in different nests. Some memories last only moments, like smoke in the wind. Others stick around for maybe twenty seconds, running in circles like a dog chasing its tail through the neural paths. And some, the ones that really matter, they get carved into the very meat of you, written in proteins like scripture in stone.\n\nThey tried to map it all out, these men of science with their theories and their models. They drew pictures of it like a web, with every thought connected to every other thought by strings of meaning. Chair to table, table to wood, wood to tree, tree to forest, forest to darkness. All of it linked together in a great network that stretches through the skull like stars in the night sky, each one burning with its own fierce light.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets fell and with them fell the dreams and hopes and futures of countless souls who had staked their claims on promises writ in sand. The unemployment came like a thief in the night and the houses stood empty like the skulls of dead things in the desert and the great corporations that had stood like giants astride the nation lay broken and bleeding in the dust.\n\nThe seeds of this darkness were planted in older times. In the Clinton years when men dreamed of power eternal and sought to buy the hearts of the masses with promises of homes they could not afford. They rewrote the ancient laws of lending like false prophets rewriting scripture and the banks genuflected before the altar of profit and risk. Fannie Mae and its twisted sister Freddie Mac packaged these poisoned promises and sold them like snakeoil across the land.\n\nThe mortgages were crafted by men who dealt in shadows and complexity. They fashioned instruments of debt more byzantine than the labyrinths of old, weaving together the fates of millions in webs of paper and promise. CDOs they called them, and CMOs, and a hundred other names in a tongue that spoke only of greed. The people leveraged their futures against dreams and the dreams turned to nightmares when the bubble burst like a boil upon the face of the nation.\n\nWhen the reckoning came it came with the swift terrible justice of an Old Testament God. The great houses of finance tottered and fell. Bear Stearns. Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers. Their names now whispered like the names of dead kings. Four trillion in debt hung like a millstone around their necks. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were transformed, made to wear the chains of regulation like penitents. Fannie and Freddie, those twin towers of hubris, fell into the arms of the government like prodigal children seeking sanctuary. September 2008. The month when the old world died and the new world was born in blood and bankruptcy.",
            "The words lay there like bones bleached white in desert sun. Exposition. A word that carries weight like a coffin carried by pallbearers who dont know the dead. Writers take to it like vultures to carrion, thinking their prose will sing but finding instead it croaks deep in the throat of the reader who holds no patience for such things.\n\nThe old doctor would curse at the screen when she found herself trapped in passages thick with detail that served no purpose save to fill space with words. Words that carried no blood in them. No life. Just dead things arranged in rows like headstones in an abandoned graveyard.\n\nShow dont tell. The writers commandment carved in stone but broken daily like any other holy decree. The devil that whispers to put down the history first sits on one shoulder while its twin perches on the other urging every detail of every life be spelled out in full. Neither devil speaks truth.\n\nTo tell a thing is to kill it. When a man speaks to camera explaining how things came to be its already too late. The story has died in his mouth before the words take flight. In books the writer becomes that man, that teller of dead tales.\n\nConsider the woman who lost her man. You could say they met and married and he died. Three things that happened like three bullets fired into the night. But that aint the truth of it. The truth lives in how his hands moved when he spoke to her that first time. How the rain fell the day they wed. How his blood looked black as oil in the moonlight when they put him down. These things carry the weight of truth. The rest is just wind passing through empty rooms.\n\nA writer must give meat to these bones but most times they rush past like coyotes with fresh kill, dropping pieces of the truth as they run. They got a man who worked nights at a gas station, former Air Force, twice married and childless, who likes to fish and dreams of owning that station someday. They think knowing he ate eggs benedict that morning matters. It dont. What matters is how he holds his coffee cup like it might break. How he stares out into the dark thinking about things that cant be changed. That's where the story lives.",
            "The morning brought news like carrion birds circling. First came word from Ashley, a town small and godless, where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife. His face in the jailhouse photo bore the hollow eyes of something ancient and terrible. The story passed quick as summer lightning, leaving only the echo of steel meeting flesh.\n\nThen came word of the boy Buyers, eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods. The streets there run dark with old sins, and the SWAT men moved through them like black-clad pilgrims seeking redemption that wouldn't come. The news gave it scarce attention, like they always did when dark skin met darker fate. White flesh makes better stories, they reckon, though death makes no such distinction.\n\nA bullet had found the Med-Flight bird, a .22 singing through metal skin. Five thousand dollars to name the shooter, though money rarely loosens true tongues. The weather woman spoke of rain coming, her words a incantation against the heat that held the city in its grip. Mid-eighties, she said, like numbers could capture the weight of August air.\n\nThey told of a UDF store on Clime Road, robbed by a man they described like reading scripture - dark-skinned, hooded, tall and lean as a desert coyote. They lingered on his blackness like preachers on sin. Then came the tale of Rodriguez, the Texas man who'd sent green poison north. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if breaking time into smaller pieces might make the sentence weigh more heavy. They named him Hispanic, though the drugs he moved cared nothing for the blood of those who carried them.\n\nAll these stories floating like ash in morning light, each one carrying its own kind of darkness, its own particular damnation.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like a shadow across the financial plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets like some dark harbinger of wealth. It trades like any stock would trade but carries within it multitudes, like some great beast containing smaller beasts, all of them moving in concert across the electronic wilderness of the exchange.\n\nThe thing about an ETF is it gives a man what he needs. Diversification. The ability to sell short when the darkness comes. Margin buying when opportunity presents itself. A man can buy one share or a thousand and the transaction cares not which. The costs they keep low, lower than them mutual funds that promise the same things but deliver less. But there aint nothing in this world comes without its price and the commissions you pay like death taking its due.\n\nThe variety of these funds stretches far as the eye can see but a man must look careful at what they promise. Diversification they say. Benefits they claim. But the wise know that promises need testing against the hard light of day.\n\nWe set our eyes on one called IHF, studying it like a tracker would study spoor in the desert sand. Comparing it against its ten largest holdings like comparing a wolf to the pack that made it. We aimed to know if owning the one was better than owning the ten separate, and if there might be some better way to arrange these pieces into something that would yield more bounty.\n\nThe task of examining every holding would be like counting every grain of sand in the Mojave so we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of what the thing held within its borders. These ten we listed out with their percentages like counting coup.\n\nTo know how these ten represented the whole we did the calculations, cold and merciless as winter arithmetic. We normalized them to hundred percent, figured their contribution to Beta and Return like some financial alchemist seeking truth in numbers. The results we laid out in charts black and stark as cemetery markers.\n\nWhat the numbers told was this: them ten holdings alone would yield 6.11 percent more than the ETF itself, like finding extra water in what you thought was a dry well. The Beta ran lower too, by point twelve. But numbers can lie like any man can lie and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just shadows cast by statistical moonlight.",
            "The numbers told a story and it wasnt a good one. They fell like dead leaves in that third month, scattered and forgotten on the cold New England ground. Winter had come as it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned like metal skeletons against the brick walls. The footprints in the snow grew fewer. The people who once walked now drove their machines, sealed against the wind and ice like pilgrims in iron churches.\n\nDecember brought its own peculiar madness. The scholars bent over their books and the teachers over their marks and the logging of journeys became a thing of ghosts and memories. Then the holidays came and the campus emptied like a dead town in some forsaken territory, wind whistling through the empty corridors where once there were footsteps.\n\nThey came back in January but the numbers stayed low, a fact that could not be explained away by the cold or the snow or the dark mornings that made men seek the comfort of their automobiles. February was worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash. We tried to rekindle it with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flaring that brought some warmth back to the numbers.\n\nThe truth was simpler and harder both. The machine had become like a second skin to these people, a carapace of steel and glass that spoke to something deeper than convenience. It was freedom itself, hammered into shape in Detroit and Tokyo, freedom that had seeped into the blood and bones of a nation. We fought it with trinkets - paper promises for coffee and books and food. But perhaps we should have fought steel with steel, tempted them with better machines - bicycles wrought fine as spiderwebs, automobiles that ran on lightning instead of dead dinosaurs. Maybe then the numbers would have told a different story. Maybe then the parking lots wouldn't have swallowed up the earth like tar pits, waiting to fossilize our good intentions.",
            "They were fifteen of them. Edison's trick films. Made in them years between 1895 and 1901 and stored now in that great repository of memory called the Library of Congress. Films that dealt in illusions and deceptions, wrought from the manipulation of the captured light itself. Most followed a strict catechism of rules, like ancient rites passed down through generations of showmen, though some dared venture beyond these bounds.\n\nThe films lived within wooden boxes, confined like prisoners to their proscenium frames. No movement of the eye that captured them, just the stark geometry of the stage inherited from those tattered vaudeville halls where magicians once plied their trade. The figures moved like specters across the frame, east to west, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In one such phantom play called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in that last year before the century turned, the players moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal rails, disappearing into the void beyond the frame's edge while the camera stood witness, immobile as stone.\n\nThese were pictures made at distance. No intimate portraits here. The camera kept its respectful remove like a mourner at a funeral, showing all and revealing nothing. Close-up shots were forbidden fruit in these early days, when the medium still wore its theatrical chains. The players kept to their appointed grounds, neither advancing nor retreating, trapped in that middle distance like souls in purgatory.\n\nTime itself was compressed in these reels. One shot, one film, that was the law. A minute or less of light and shadow, captured at varying speeds as if time itself was uncertain. They were simple things, these tricks. Disappearances, transformations, the stuff of carnival shows. But look closer at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, that grim spectacle from 1895. Watch how the illusion fractures if you study it hard enough, the moment when Mary's head becomes no more than a prop, though the eye wants to see it whole. That's the true trick of it. Not in the making but in the believing.",
            "In the dark hollows of literary history there lies what men call the Gothic Novel, a thing both ancient and new, like some terrible creature born of time itself. Ian Watt spoke of it as an oxymoron, this old-new thing, but words are wind and definitions are the chains men forge to bind what cannot be bound. The Gothic rides through our consciousness like a midnight rider, praised and damned in equal measure, called shallow by some and sublime by others who spoke of terror like Burke did, as if terror could be contained in words alone.\n\nIt began with Walpole and his Castle of Otranto, that first dark seed planted in the garden of letters. He took the ancient ways and the modern paths and wed them together like some unholy union, birthing what he named A Gothic Story. The gothic ways ran deep in it like roots in black earth - medieval theatre, stone arches pointing to heaven, traditions old as blood. Even then gothic meant many things to many men, like a word that had lost its way in time, wandering through centuries marked primitive by those who called themselves modern and enlightened.\n\nBut it was the marriage of these things - the theatrical gothic with its masks and its mysteries, and the novel with its way of peeling back the skull to see the thoughts beneath - that gave it life eternal. It became like some ageless thing, dead but not dying, new but not young, speaking across the vast desert of years to readers yet unborn.\n\nThe ghost of Chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that will not rest. In Otranto it lives and breathes, though changed from what it was in medieval times when knights rode forth in steel and honor. Walpole saw his world bereft of such things, saw politics and power strip bare the bones of honor until nothing remained but hollow men in hollow halls. He yearned for what was lost, for the idealized past that perhaps never was, but in that yearning he created something new.\n\nIn his character of Frederic we see this clearest, like looking through dark water to stones beneath. Before he steps onto the stage we know him by the marks of chivalry upon his soul - a prince who has known suffering, who has walked through fire and shadow, believed dead at the hands of infidels in some far land. Here stands the knight of old tales, but twisted, exaggerated, excessive like all things gothic must be, as if viewed through a glass that magnifies and distorts until the familiar becomes strange and the strange becomes familiar.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the minds of men who sought to move goods across vast spaces from maker to buyer through the raw materials and the making and the moving and all manner of commerce between. A consultant named Oliver had given it this name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. It was a process both simple and complex in its execution, like the weaving of a vast tapestry where each thread must find its place lest the whole thing come undone.\n\nSix elements existed in this chain and they were like the bones of some great beast: production and supply and inventory and location and transportation and information. Each one vital as blood, each one carrying its own weight in the grand scheme of things.\n\nProduction stood first among these elements, a foundation stone upon which all else was built. In the way of all things it began with want, with need, with desire. The managers would study the market like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what the people would buy and what they would not. They would make their decisions based on these auguries, choosing what would be made and where it would be made and how many would be made. Each decision carried weight, each choice echoing down through the chain like thunder across empty plains.\n\nHe had seen this himself in the great retail houses of Walmart and Target, where every action was prescribed and every movement calculated, down to the very clothes the workers wore and the way the trucks were emptied of their goods. It was a machinery vast and precise, and like all machinery it could fail if not tended proper.\n\nThen there was supply, that great decision of what would be done within the walls and what would be sent to others to do. They called it outsourcing when they sent the work away, seeking that thing they called velocity, though velocity was nothing more than the marriage of quality and flexibility with the eternal pursuit of lower costs. It was a dance of numbers and capabilities, of core competencies and strategic partnerships, all of it moving in a rhythm old as commerce itself.",
            "They came in the dark Victorian age like wraiths or phantoms stalking the halls of literature. Books of the aristocracy and their ways. Books of parlors and teacups and proper manners laid bare upon the page in infinite detail as if God himself had ordained their cataloguing. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from their kin like dark sheep in a pristine flock, carrying with them elements of mystery and the bizarre that no proper Victorian novel would dare embrace. These elements moved through the stories like smoke, seeping into the characters, making them more real somehow. More true.\n\n\"And now hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.\" That's what they wrote of Oliver. He walked between Sikes and Crackit who were not there but were there all the same, their voices real as gunsmoke in his ears. The boy stumbled through this fever dream while shots rang out and lights blazed across his vision like St. Elmo's fire and all the while pain rode him like a demon, constant and merciless.\n\nThese fever dreams and nightmares served as windows into souls. In Oliver's case they laid bare the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting came back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it came like a visitation, like judgment. He was there again. The pistol. The flash. The darkness. Some unseen hand bearing him away while Sikes and Crackit argued in his head like specters at a hanging. The pain was everywhere and nowhere. It had become like breathing. Like existing. The boy was powerless in this world of men and monsters, his will counted for nothing, and old Fagin's poison had already begun to work its way into his blood, into his bones, into whatever remained of hope.\n\nThe day that wasnt a day passed and night came again. Long night. Short night. Silent as death and gone in an instant.",
            "In them days I worked with the children after their schooling was done, them small faces bent over books and papers in the failing light. English and reading was what I knew best and that's what I done. There was this boy named Adrian, might've been nine or ten years old, struggling with his letters like a blind man counting coins. Something wasnt right with how he read. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs carved in stone by ancient peoples long dead.\n\nThe boy was Mexican sure enough but spoke English pure as any native born. We went on like that for a time until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some expedition. She stood there in her clean work clothes speaking no English at all, just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read right enough but the English letters was foreign to him, like tracks in the desert that dont match no animal you know.\n\nI tell this tale not just to speak on the wall between languages in our schools out here in California but to show how the obvious aint always obvious at all. Even a child speaking perfect English might find reading it like crossing a river in flood. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him them letters and sounds till they was familiar as his own face in the mirror. But for them children who barely speak English at all, that's a harder path to walk.\n\nAin't no single answer neither. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in using all of them together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching is good for all children, not just them that speak Spanish first. Studies show these children do better than their peers but folk still fear it like they fear what they dont understand. If we was to make this the rule instead of the exception, every child would profit from it. We dont need every teacher speaking two languages - that aint realistic. But we sure could use some special helpers who know both tongues, like scouts who know both sides of the border.",
            "From the time we are young they tell us there is something greater than ourselves out there in the vast dark. Something beyond knowing. The old ones send their young to houses of God built of wood and stone and glass where they learn tales passed down through time immemorial. Some take these stories into themselves like bread and water while others cast them away, declaring themselves alone in the void. We wander through our days seeking meaning in different vessels, different shapes, trading one truth for another like worn currency. All of us searching for that pale fire in the blackness that might lead us home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set in the failing light watching the rain beat against the tin roof, smoke rising from our cigarettes like lost prayers. Water ran in the gutters and drowned the flowers that mother had planted years ago. He looked out into the gray waste of evening with eyes that seemed to see both nothing and everything at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's rags, his skull showing through the thinning hair like something unearthed. We didnt speak. What words could fill such spaces. I moved closer and we watched the rain together while the day bled out into darkness.\n\nHe died in the winter. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him poison to fight the poison in his blood but it only stretched his suffering like a wire drawn too tight. I cursed God in the nighttime. Sat in rooms darker than any church and spoke no prayers to the emptiness. If there was something out there listening it had turned its face from us long ago.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not. The witnessing of such things marks a soul in ways that cant be unnamed. I wanted him alive in my memory not cold and white in some sterile room where machines counted down his last hours. They knew, all of them, that his only son would not stand vigil at his passing. I lay in my bed for three days like Jonah in the belly of the whale waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He was a man of the soil first and of politics second, this John Taylor of Caroline, and in him burned something fierce and righteous about the nature of freedom and the proper role of governance. The earth itself had shaped his thoughts on what a nation ought be, and from this came all else: his views on sovereignty and law and justice and the machinery of state.\n\nThe land was new then. Virgin territory for governance unmarred by the old ways that had poisoned the minds of men across the water. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever force breathed life into mankind were like links in an iron chain, break one and the whole thing falls to rust and ruin. These things, he reckoned, must stay beyond the reach of men who would rule other men.\n\nSome spoke of natural states where the strong and cunning preyed upon the weak, but Taylor knew civilization must rise above such base things. He carried within him a stark vision of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between. The government, he said, must account for both these forces dwelling in the hearts of men. Good was the protection of property and the cultivation of soil. Evil was the gathering of wealth through paper and promises. He knew that self-interest drove all men but saw how it could twist and corrupt, creating parasites who fed upon the labor of others.\n\nThe Constitution, he believed, must be read like scripture - strict but with wisdom. Let the federal government be small and bound by chains of paper and ink, for a fat government grows hungry and tyrannical. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be understood, the intentions of those who wrote it known. And above all else stood the Declaration, that first document which spoke of sovereign states joined in common cause but not merged into one great beast of governance.\n\nHe would have seen what was coming, this Caroline farmer. Would have watched the slow death of his agrarian dream with eyes that knew too well the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts when power called to them. But he planted his ideas like seeds in the furrows of a young nation's mind, and some took root and grow there still.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, thoughts coming and going unbidden and unbound by the constraints of consciousness until there was nothing left but the pure act of seeing.\n\nHe'd bought the book once. An art book. Some woman who wrote about the brain and how to make it draw what the eye sees true. She wrote of frames and squares and how to parse the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vast terrible everything of existence and cut it down to size. But there was no frame now. No square. Just the terrible brown truth of what lay before him.\n\nThe porcelain was white as bone. White as the skulls of dead things in the desert. He touched the silver handle with fingers that knew their purpose and watched the water spiral down like some primal force of nature. The brown mass stayed. Unmoved. Uncaring. Like something ancient buried in the earth that refused to yield its secrets.\n\nHe stood in his uniform. The green tie at his throat like a noose. The mop beside him like a companion in this strange ritual. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom cast no shadows and in their stark truth there was nowhere to hide from what must be done. He pulled at the paper on the wall, wrapping his hand like a man preparing for war, layer upon layer until the shape of his hand was lost in the whiteness. Then he reached down into the water the way a man reaches into his own past knowing there is no good thing to find there.\n\nThe water was cold. Cold as death. Cold as truth.",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their clean white coats say the young mind aint ready for such things. That it cannot grasp the weight of steel and speed and death that comes with it. But they drive all the same.\n\nThe inexperience sits in them like poison. Makes them roll vehicles that ought not roll. Makes them press pedals that ought not be pressed. Makes them leave roads that ought to be followed. And they travel in packs these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom that wolves carry in their blood. Some state men in California watched them die and counted the bodies and made charts of the dead showing how they died more when they ran together.\n\nThe state tried to fix it. Made papers that said when they could drive and who could ride with them. But papers dont stop blood from flowing when metal meets metal on the midnight highways. Papers dont make young minds old.\n\nSome doctor named Zuckerman he says even eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of it like addicts seeking poison. Says we ought to wait till the blood runs cooler in their veins. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there will be more of them. Children of the boomers coming up like dark clouds on the horizon ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nCould make a law about it. Simple thing really. Keep them learning in schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen years have passed. Make them prove themselves like California does with their fifty hours of watching and learning. Make it the same everywhere across this blood-soaked nation.\n\nAint nothing new in what I say. Just truth that sits there plain as death on a highway.",
            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder and it lives in the spaces between hearing and knowing. Not in the ear itself but in the dark corridors of the brain where sound becomes meaning. Like a demon that steals understanding from the minds of those afflicted leaving them whole in body but fractured in comprehension.\n\nThe disorder moves through three territories and we will walk them all. First the nature of the thing itself. Then the marking of its presence in the afflicted, the signs writ in behavior and confusion that herald its existence. Last the methods by which those who teach might aid the cursed ones in rooms full of the blessed.\n\nIt began in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with names like Bocca and Calearo hunting for understanding in the minds of children who could hear but could not listen. They created tests. Mapped the territories of confusion. In 1977 they gathered, these searchers of broken sound, to share their dark knowledge.\n\nThe disorder manifests like a ghost in the machine of consciousness. Some cannot locate sound in space as if the world were flat and dimensionless. Some cannot parse the difference between sounds that fall like rain upon their ears. Some cannot hear the mockery in a voice or the anger beneath soft words. The sounds come but meaning dies stillborn in the mind.\n\nThey test for it now with machines and questionnaires and observations recorded in careful hands. Audiologists and speech pathologists move through the darkness of the affliction with their instruments like blind men with sticks, tapping at the walls of comprehension. They send sounds into the ear like scouts into enemy territory and measure what returns. But no single test can capture its presence fully. The disorder remains elusive, like smoke in a closed room, its origins unknown, its territory mapped but never fully conquered.",
            "They were the lost ones. The broken ones. Children with eyes like empty wells and families splintered like old wood left too long in the sun. I knew them before I knew their names. Knew their stories written in bruises and silence. The social work, it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night.\n\nService and respect aint just words writ on paper. They're carved deep in the bone. In the marrow. Ethics aint something you learn from books neither. You carry it or you dont.\n\nI wandered them halls of learning for years, watching them young ones flee from their demons. Some found poison in the bottle, others in the needle. After Piedmont College in 09 I drifted like smoke until that summer day when fate showed its hand. There was this boy. Sixteen maybe. Sitting scared on my friend's couch like a sparrow in a thunderstorm. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave scars deeper than skin.\n\nI went to their house. The law was there already, blue lights cutting through the twilight like cold stars. Told them what I knew. What I'd learned in them psychology books. They asked me to talk to the parents and I did. Heard their excuses like bitter wind through dead trees. Simple disputes, they called it. Simple. Nothing simple about terror in a child's eyes.\n\nJustice. That's what they say we got but it aint true. Society wants its people to follow like sheep. Wants em numbered and counted and sorted. But I seen different. Seen the truth of it. In school I fought against their rules like a wolf fights against the trap. Colored my hair wild colors that nature never dreamed of. Marked my flesh with metal. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Gay. Straight. Bisexual. All God's creatures carrying their own truth.\n\nRacism and hate, they're like poison in the well. Been fighting against em since I could stand. Still am. Always will be. That's the path I chosen. Or maybe it chosen me. Either way, here I am, walking toward them dark places where children cry in the night, carrying whatever light I got left to give.",
            "Sleep comes unbidden like a thief in the night or it doesnt come at all. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like some dark totem carved from the bones of sleepless nights, its shadow cast long across the biological and sociocultural planes of human understanding. They who study such things speak of models and methods, of inherited traits passed down through blood and bone, and of the world that shapes us like wind shapes stone.\n\nThe categorization of sleep's absence comes in three forms, each more merciless than the last. Primary disorders stand alone like sentinels in the night. Others walk hand in hand with the demons of the mind, those axis disorders that plague mankind since time immemorial. And still others come from the poison we put in our bodies or the failing of our mortal shells.\n\nIn the realm of primary disorders there are the Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, names given by men in white coats to the horrors that stalk the night. Insomnia, that cruel mistress, denies sleep to those who seek it. Hypersomnia, her sister, drags men down into unwanted slumber like stones beneath dark water. Narcolepsy strikes like a serpent, sudden and without mercy. The Parasomnias bring their own terrors - nightmares that tear through the mind like wolves through flesh, sleep terrors that freeze the blood, and sleepwalking that sends the unconscious body wandering through the dark hours.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the microscopic spaces between life and death, neurons fire like distant stars. They carry orexin, the messenger of wake and sleep, through channels as old as time itself. The scientists, they found these things in mice first. GABAB receptors, they called them, gatekeepers of consciousness. When they opened these gates with their chemicals and medicines, sleep came like a flood. But nature is cruel and what works in mice may not work in men. The inheritance of such mechanisms through bloodlines means some are born to wander the night while others sleep sound in their beds.",
            "Been here two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters in this place they call University Park where the wind howls cold across empty spaces between buildings and the snow falls sideways like God's own spite. Started out in East Halls, far as you could go before hitting wilderness and stadium concrete. Stuart Hall was home then. Twenty-five minutes walking to Willard through weather that'd freeze the heart of hell itself. That's how it goes in State College.\n\nTalked once to someone who'd been here before. Not much older but spoke of different times. Said East Halls stood alone then, separated by vast emptiness like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields and buildings rise up from that emptiness. New Creamery. New health building. Apartments sprout like weeds in cracked earth. Campus grows like some living thing, stretching, expanding, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nThe bicycle. That's what saves you here. Simple machine of steel and rubber but it needs more than just existing. Needs riders. Needs paths. Needs purpose.\n\nFriend of mine found his way back to cycling after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. Nothing else like it for getting around, he said, fashion be damned. Bowl of oatmeal becomes thirty miles of freedom. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm ever was. Bought a bike. Best thing I done. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from where I sleep. On the bike, five minutes if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it ain't friendly. Not to bikes. Not to nothing really.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time ain't one of them. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in wind. More when you count everything else needs doing. Time's a currency can't be borrowed back once spent. Bike saves what little I got left of it.",
            "They had come to see what the old man Huxley had writ about the machines and the money and how they worked together like serpents in the dark. In his book about the brave world that was to come he showed them people who lived not as ones but as many, folks who sought nothing but the quick pleasure of the moment like animals rutting in the field. And above them all stood the Controller like some dark god, moving his pieces across a board none could see.\n\nThe dead prophets of old had spoke of such things. Marx and his ilk who saw how the powerful made the weak believe lies about their own chains. In this new world they had built the people were less than cattle, branded and sorted by letters like freight in a trainyard. Deltas. Gammas. Names that meant nothing and everything. They filled their heads with whispered commands while they slept, telling them to spend and want and need until there wasnt nothing left inside them that was their own.\n\nWeren't no real love in this place neither. The people moved through their days like ghosts, touching but never feeling, speaking but never saying. The men talked of women like they was discussing livestock, measuring their worth in flesh and curves they called pneumatic. The women were no better, trading stories of their rutting like they was discussing the weather. Each class of folk stayed in their place like it was writ in stone, believing the lies they'd been fed since before they could walk. They consumed and obeyed and never looked up to see the bars of their cage, thinking themselves free while wearing chains they'd been taught to love.\n\nThe Controller watched it all from his high tower, knowing what Marx knew - that if you tell a man he's special while you rob him blind, he'll thank you for the privilege. And so they went on, all of them, dancing to music they couldn't hear, played by hands they couldn't see.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The question hung in the air like woodsmoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since the towers fell have shifted like desert sands, the wind of public opinion blowing first one way then another, media voices crying hostility then tolerance in equal measure. Now we stand in a time where a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his lineage, could reach for the highest seat in the land. Such things were not dreamt of in the days when the towers still stood.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. It moves against what history whispers, like two streams flowing contrary. I had known Muhammad as a conqueror, a man who bent tribes to his will and branded their souls with his faith through steel and fire. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of men until they saw truth in his words and came crawling through the dust to drink from his wisdom. \n\nThey write of miracles that echo like mockingbirds singing borrowed songs. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes, feeding forty when it should have fed few. The writers craft their prophet in borrowed robes, dressing him in the cast-off garments of the Nazarene. They diminish Christ's glory by making their prophet wear his face like a mask.\n\nTheir stories come wrapped in layers of telling, each voice more distant than the last. They say this man told that man who heard from another, words passing through countless mouths like water through too many vessels, each one losing something in the pouring. They meant these tellings to be proof but they stand as hollow as desert bones bleached by sun and time.\n\nWhat gnaws at the mind is how they shape him soft and holy, this Muhammad. A gentle soul dispensing wisdom like morning dew. But history tells another tale, written in blood and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true shape of the man whose name they praise. The past carries its own truth, and no amount of gentle words can wash the blood from its pages.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of history while they marched forward with their own designs. The truth of it lay bare and bleeding in the centuries that followed, each generation stepping further from the source like concentric rings in dead water. Yet now something stirs in the minds of men. Some ancient knowing. The old guard stands fast with their dogma but their numbers thin like shadows at noon.\n\nThe Christians will remember. They will look back across the waste of years and see what was lost. What was added. Layer upon layer of doctrine like rust on pure metal. It may take generations, maybe more, but time bends back on itself like a snake eating its tail. They'll strip away the accumulated weight of centuries, peeling back the years like old paint until nothing remains but the raw wood of his words, unvarnished and true.\n\nWhen this knowing sweeps across the old countries like wildfire, burning away the chaff of centuries, the church will abide. But it will be changed. The countless branches of belief will draw together like scattered cattle before a storm. The differences between them will blur and fade like old photographs left in the sun. Unity will rise from diversity like a phoenix from ash.\n\nHistory moves in great circles. The Romans who fed Christians to lions knelt before crosses in time. The land that chains broke now bears black leaders. And so too will Christianity circle back to its source, seeking truth in the bones of its beginning. They'll read his words anew, not as stone tablets but as living things, metaphors breathing in the mind.\n\nBefore all this there was only Judaism. Before Rome planted its eagles in Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the pillars. But even then the people split like light through crystal - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who walked between them all.",
            "The darkness that dwells in men's hearts aint no mystery and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Like wolves they are, prowling through the night, seeking only their own fortunes and caring nothing for the weak that fall beneath their feet. The book lays it bare and cold and true.\n\nYou see it most in them factory bosses, them kings of industry who sit high in their towers of brick and iron. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, their only god being the almighty dollar. Sinclair writes of how them buildings stood against the sky like ancient ruins, dark towers belching forth rivers of smoke that stretched on forever into the void, as if hell itself had opened its maw upon the earth. The owners, they didnt care none about what their machines did to the air or how their waste poisoned the ground. The rivers ran thick with blood and offal from ten thousand beasts, but profit was their only truth.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Expendable. Replaceable. Like Sinclair says, the whole place was nothing but a cauldron of hate, where a man's worth was measured only in coins. They'd work a man till his hands bled and his spirit broke, then cast him aside like a spent shell casing. No warning. No mercy. Just the cold mathematics of greed.\n\nIn them days there weren't no laws to protect the weak. No safety nets. No guardian angels. The factory was a beast that fed on flesh and bone, grinding up immigrants and poor folk alike in its terrible machinery. Them that lived in Packingtown was caught in a web of misery with no escape, like flies in a spider's web. The unions that claimed to help was just another kind of parasite, feeding off the desperation of them that had nothing left to give.\n\nThey called it progress but it was slavery by another name. As Sinclair put it, them foreign folk and poor people was hanging by a thread, their very existence dependent on the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And just like them ancient slavers, these modern masters bred the same rot in men's souls, the same darkness that turns brother against brother and makes monsters of men.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Word was he took to writing bout some place called Thulé, twice marking it in his verses like a man marking the start and end of his territory. Virgil knew of this place too, wrote of it in times long past, called it an island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness. But there was something else, something closer to our time that bore watching.\n\nPoe had himself a powerful thirst for German writing, deep and relentless as any desert wanderer. There was this man Goethe, wrote himself a thing called Faust, published in two pieces like a broken mirror, first part in 1808, second when death came calling for him in 32. Inside that second piece lay hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé they called it. Story goes of a king whose woman died leaving him nothing but a goblet and memories that drove him to drink. Grief ate at him like rust on iron till he gave everything away save that cup, walked himself to the edge of the world and cast it into the black waters below, then closed his eyes for the last time.\n\nYou can see the shadows of one man's writing in the other's, like blood seeping through floorboards. Both speaking of loss and drink and darkness. Both walking through lands where the sun fears to tread. Poe took that word Thulé and made it his own in The Pit and Pendulum, then again in Dreamland, bookending his verses like a man marking his grave at both ends.\n\nIn Dreamland the speaker wanders through a world stripped of color, haunted by ghosts of them that's gone before, like some dark mirror of Goethe's grieving king. Both men, separated by ocean and years, writing bout the same darkness, same loneliness, same weight of memory that drives men to drink and death.\n\nWeren't no accident neither. Poe knew Goethe's work like a man knows the scars on his own hands. Had to, being the kind that followed Tennyson's writings close as a shadow. The German's words was everywhere in them days, spreading like wildfire through the minds of them that read, and Poe, he was always one to watch the flames.",
            "The law speaks of malice and punishment in the sunbaked streets of California where a woman fell and broke herself upon the tiled floor of a market. The floor gleamed wet with spilled applesauce like some pale blood of commerce and the manager sat in his office eating his dinner while the world turned and customers walked the aisles unwarned.\n\nThey had told him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan coming to his door like prophets of some minor doom and he had turned them away with words about time and dinner and things that could wait. But things that wait carry their own judgment and at half past five Palmer found the slick spot that waited patient as a snake and fell. Her back broke or near enough to it. The fifth such falling in that year alone, as if the store itself hungered for broken bodies upon its floor.\n\nThe question of punishment lies cold as stone in the hands of judges who must weigh despicable acts against the letter of civil code. Section 3294 speaks of malice like some ancient text, defining the darkness in men's hearts when they know the danger that waits and yet do nothing. The manager knew. He had seen five others fall in that same year, their bodies marking the calendar of his negligence like stations of some retail cross.\n\nThe courts have spoken before of such things. In Taylor they drew the lines between simple failure and willful disregard, between accident and malice. They spoke of men who see the consequences coming like dark riders on the horizon and choose to let them ride. The manager saw them coming. Twice warned and twice he waved them on, choosing his dinner over the safety of those who walked his aisles in trust.\n\nThe law will not dismiss this easily. It will weigh the manager's indifference against the broken body of Palmer and find there something more than simple neglect. Something that speaks of conscious choice and willing blindness to consequence. Something that carries the weight of punishment beyond mere compensation.",
            "The wanting had been there always. A void that would not fill. It came upon her in her fourteenth year like some dark spirit that takes hold and will not loose its grip and even now three years hence it remained steadfast and cruel in its persistence. She knew now it was not a thing she sought but a someone and yet no boy had stirred her heart. They came to her with their fumbling advances and their awkward words but she felt nothing. She questioned this strangeness in herself, this absence of desire that seemed to mark her different from other girls her age. Years of thinking on it had yielded nothing but hollow theories that crumbled like ash in her hands.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through life like two leaves carried by the same stream, never quarreling, never raising voices except when their daughter's wild spirit threatened to break free of their gentle waters. She was their opposite, full of light and motion, drawing others to her like moths to flame yet carrying in her heart a kindness that made her beloved by all who knew her.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried death in its teeth. She wandered the rooms seeking something unnamed when her mother's scream cut through the silence like a blade. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain twisting her face into something ancient and terrible. Mama, she said. Mama what's wrong. The words came broken and gasping. Hospital, her mother said. Take me. The girl lifted her mother like a child, thankful for the strength in her arms that she had built over years. She carried her to the car and laid her in the back like some precious cargo and drove through streets that seemed suddenly foreign and hostile.\n\nThe hospital rose before them like a white monument to suffering. Inside the air hung thick with chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to the woman in her arms. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling a narrow bed between them. They took her mother away down corridors that seemed to stretch into forever and left her alone with her thoughts in a plastic chair that had held countless others before her, all waiting, all afraid.\n\nLater they would tell her how her mother had reached for something beautiful, a simple vase high up where such things are kept, and how the stool had betrayed her like all simple things sometimes do.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistical dark. Not the diet of their fathers but something older still. Plant foods and fish flesh and the oils that run golden, not white like the rendered fats of beasts. The drink too, measured and portioned like sacrament.\n\nThey had seen it before in other studies, dark auguries in the data that showed how death came slower to those who followed the old ways. The heart's betrayals less frequent, the body's weight held in check. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that thief of mind and movement.\n\nThey gathered their witchcraft of numbers from seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, all nurses, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. None had the sugar sickness nor the heart's early warnings. For twenty years they watched and waited, gathering their testimonies six times over, asking what passed their lips and in what measure. The women marked their papers faithful as penitents, year after year, more than nineteen in twenty staying true to the cause.\n\nWhen death came they searched the records, the cold files of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable, lacking the certainty of paper proof, but these too they counted in their ledger of loss. They weighed all things: the smoke in their lungs, the pills they took, the blood that ceased its monthly flow, the sweat of their leisure hours.\n\nThrough machines that counted and sorted they fed their numbers, adjusting for the chaos of living, for age and smoke and flesh and movement. And in the end the truth came clear as bones in desert sand. Those who followed closest the Mediterranean way, they died less from the heart's failings and the brain's dark floods. In numbers it showed: two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts stopped or wounded, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke's shadow, one thousand seventy-seven souls taken by the combined assault of heart and brain.\n\nThe numbers spoke their truth. Those who ate as the ancients ate, they lived longer than their sisters who did not. This was the power of old wisdom written in modern blood.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign reads. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stands at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old. Dark ink bleeding into the corrupted pulp. Burma they call it now though names mean nothing in such places where men with guns make their own truth. Since sixty-two the soldiers have ruled there, taking power like thieves in the night, their boots echoing down empty streets where democracy once walked.\n\nThey came in saffron robes, the monks did. Walking the streets like fire made flesh, their procession a silent scream against the military that ruled their world. At first the government let them be but violence has its own gravity and soon enough the night was filled with the sound of splintering temple doors and the wet thud of rifle butts against flesh. The foreign writers disappeared into concrete cells or wooden boxes. A Japanese man named Nagai bled out on the street, his camera still clicking as his life leaked away into the dust.\n\nThirteen dead they say. But the colonel who fled speaks of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle night. The truth of it lost to the darkness like so many truths before.\n\nThese things are old as time itself. Rome's emperors claimed divine right while they burned the world. The sons of heaven rule Japan still, their divinity unchanged by cars and computers and ritual death. Here in our own land the president speaks to holy men who sell salvation like carnival barkers hawking painted shells.\n\nThe stories repeat. Tiananmen Square ran red while tanks ground students into the pavement. Rwanda's machetes flashed in the sun as neighbor killed neighbor. Hitler's ovens burned day and night until the sky itself turned gray with ash.\n\nAnd still we stand here, holding signs against the darkness, as if paper and ink could stop bullets and hate.",
            "The ghost of Duke Ellington haunts the halls of jazz like some dark specter that won't lay down to rest, his presence carved deep into the bones of music by years that stretched longer than most men dare dream. At the piano his touch was light as morning dew but in the composition of sound he was more akin to some mad architect building cathedrals of brass and wood and breath. He knew the souls of his players like a father knows his sons and he built frameworks of notes wherein they could wander free as wild horses or march strict as soldiers depending on what the music called for.\n\nThe sound lived in him and through him and he knew how to make it speak in tongues both strange and beautiful. Each player was a color on his palette and he painted with them all, making pictures in the air that no man had seen before and few since have matched. The dictionary men speak of something called Creole Love Call where he took the human voice and stripped it bare of words, leaving only pure sound like some primal thing that crawled up from the swamp of time.\n\nThe piece moves like this: First comes the voice pure as spring water calling out to reeds that answer back, the voice growing rough like old leather toward the end. Then a trumpet muted and crying blue notes into the darkness. A clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The whole band takes up the call then, brass and reeds speaking back and forth like lovers in the night. At the height of it all the reeds cry out high and wild while brass and rhythm punch holes in time itself. Then back to the beginning it goes, voice and reeds once more, but now the voice has learned to growl like some beast that's found its way into church. It ends with a woman's voice running wild and a trombone speaking blasphemy.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin, trumpet singing like a man and voice playing like brass. Later in It Don't Mean a Thing he let Nanton loose with that muted trombone of his, and if there's any sound in this world that can tell you what a soul in torment sounds like, that's the one.",
            "The shells carry their own mathematics, though men have long stood dumb before their geometries. In 1917 Thompson spoke true when he said that no zoologist had yet dreamed in the language of numbers what nature had wrought in bone and calcium, and his words echo still across the century like the voice of some dead prophet.\n\nThe mollusks build their homes in spiral paths through time and space, each revolution marking another turn in their blind journey through existence. These whorls, as men name them, spiral around an axis that ain't there except in theory, like the pole star that guides men through darkness but exists only in their minds. The columella stands as the spine of the thing, anchoring each whorl to the next in an ancient agreement between flesh and mineral.\n\nWe took their ghosts in X-ray light and fed their numbers to machines that could speak their language. The software called CerioShell consumed these measurements like some digital oracle, spitting forth predictions of forms that might be or might have been. We sought to understand the boundaries of what could exist, as if mapping the territories between the possible and impossible.\n\nThe shell grows like a testament to time itself, each revolution marking another cycle in the endless wheel of life and death. The suture line divides yesterday from today, while the body whorl stands as the final chapter in the creature's autobiography writ in calcium. The spire reaches upward like the tower of some prehistoric babel, its apex pointing toward heaven or whatever lies beyond.\n\nThrough the aperture the living thing reaches out into the world, that opening like a door between two realms - one of flesh and one of stone. We studied these shells from every angle - apical, basal, apertural - seeking in their symmetries some truth about the laws that govern all living things.\n\nTo count the whorls is to count chapters in a book written in the language of survival. Draw a line where the first suture begins and follow it through space like tracking the path of a star across the night sky. Each quarter turn tells its own story.\n\nThe mathematics of their existence can be captured, contained in formulae that describe the path of that opening through space and time. But numbers alone cant tell the whole truth of it. They are like marks on a map that show the way but not the journey.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers on the page. Ten years gone and the dead babies in Indonesia lay just as numerous as before, small corpses in their mothers' arms like broken birds. The country had met some of its promises, water flowing cleaner now through pipes and sewers, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same. The reasons lay scattered like bones in the sand, waiting to be counted.\n\nIn the villages and towns the midwives came more often now, seven births in ten seeing their weathered hands. But these women, these healers of old ways, stood powerless when the blood came too fast and too much, when death rode in on a crimson tide. The numbers spoke false comfort. And fewer children with the bloody flux saw proper doctors now, their mothers carrying them home to wait out their fever dreams, some to wake and some to sleep eternal.\n\nThe knife-birth, the cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. Four in hundred mothers felt its mercy. In the cities it came more often, seven mothers in hundred saved by the blade, but in the far places only two. The poor watched their sisters die while the rich lived on, a gap wide as twenty-seven graves between them. Money spoke here as it spoke everywhere, deciding who lived and who returned to dust.\n\nThey argued now about the path forward, whether to build towers of specific care or strengthen the whole edifice of healing. The targeted way beckoned like a mirage, promising quick victory, but carried poison in its heart. When money flowed to one wound, others festered untended. The helpers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving other sufferers to their fate. And in their haste they built parallel roads to the same destination, wasting precious time with papers and forms, duplicate wheels spinning in the sand while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like kudzu in summer heat, sprawling across a hundred years of human sound until no man could count its tendrils or name its parts. Within its vast territory lay kingdoms of sound - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk - but these too had split and divided like cells beneath a microscope, spawning bastard children that grew teeth and claws of their own.\n\nAmong these dark offspring Heavy Metal stood tallest, most terrible in its beauty. For forty years it had grown and mutated, showing faces both beautiful and grotesque, faces that spoke of rage and despair and sometimes joy though mostly it dwelt in shadows. The darkness called to others and they came, bearing guitars like weapons, and each who came carved out their own territory in the night until the territories became uncountable.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured, its boundaries fluid as mercury. What it is or aint no one can rightly say. It drinks deep from other wells of sound but its origins remain, black as pitch and twice as thick. To know the metal you must know its heart, must understand that it aint just music but a movement of souls through darkness.\n\nThe movement feeds on excess like a fever. More bass more volume more violence more theater until the ears bleed and the mind screams. Them that play it are masters of their craft, fingers flying across strings like spiders weaving webs of sound. In the seventies they found the drugs, or the drugs found them, and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like messages from some terrible heaven. It spoke truths other music dared not speak, reaching into places where light feared to go. Some say it draws power from them old Romantic composers, them that knew the darkness before electricity gave it voice. The proof's in the words they sing, black poetry that bleeds onto the page.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they maybe didn't mean to open. That song carried the sickness in it, the up-and-down fever dream of chemical paradise. Some call it the first real Metal song, though it was just them trying to outdo them Rolling Stones, to prove they could walk in darkness too. They put it on that white album like a black seed in white soil, never knowing what would grow from it.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their canvases of madness there was another who walked alone in the gardens of his mind. Rousseau was his name and he painted what he saw there. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this vision of a woman lost in some verdant paradise, though it was more than that. It was his own yearning made manifest, his hunger for acclaim that gnawed at him like some desperate animal.\n\nHe carried within him two warring spirits. One whispered of conformity, of following the paths others had worn smooth with their passing. The other spoke of wildness, of walking where none had walked before. These spirits clashed and bled within him all the days of his life.\n\nThe man himself came into the world in Laval, a town in the French northwest, in the year 1844. His father worked metal and sold hardware and knew something of comfort though not of wealth. The boy grew without learning the ways of art, became instead a collector of tolls for the state until he had seen forty winters pass. They called him douanier though this was wrong, he being merely a gabelou, a distinction that mattered little to any but those who wore such titles.\n\nDeath stalked him as it stalks all men but showed particular cruelty in taking eight of his children before they drew more than a handful of breaths each. Then it took his wife Clémence leaving him with only the girl Julia and a grief that sat in him like stone. He turned to painting then as a drowning man turns to any floating thing, hoping it might bear his weight and carry him to some distant shore.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. Matisse and others were rising then, their stars ascending while he labored in obscurity. Matisse feared the common and fought against it with every stroke of his brush while Rousseau sought it like a lover, thinking perhaps that in perfect conformity he might find perfect acceptance. But the heart wants what it wants and his brush followed paths of its own choosing, leading him through strange forests of the mind where no other had ventured.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions across the wasteland of mans thoughts. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, that beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things we learn come from books or the hard ways of life but these twin riders of truth and beauty they come to us like ghosts in the night unbidden and unexplained. We dont learn them so much as recognize them like the face of someone we knew before we were born.\n\nYou can talk about what makes something right or beautiful but you'll never catch its soul in your words. Like trying to describe the Mona Lisa. You can go on about shadow and light and what them Italian painters was thinking but in the end its just wind. People look at something beautiful and they say theres just something about it and then they try to explain but the explaining aint never enough. Same with whats right and wrong. OConnor knew it. Said you tell stories cause regular words wont do. Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics was beyond telling.\n\nThe connection twixt right and beautiful runs deeper than most think. Both of them hit you in places you cant name, like getting struck by lightning but the burns aint visible. Literature carries this burden more than other arts cause it deals in the currency of human souls. McKean wrote that moral standards might not matter much to music but they matter to stories like they matter to life itself. Stories traffic in values like a merchant trades in gold and the values is what makes them precious to us.\n\nWe recognize the truth of this like we recognize the shadow of death. It aint something you can point to or measure with any tools made by man. Its just there, waiting in the dark corners of our understanding, patient as stones, eternal as the desert night.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient beast from the earth, its spine the alps at München stretching north through darkness and light to where the Baltic waters lap at Kiel's cold shores. This same spirit moves through the land like blood through veins, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds dark and knowing. That such a thing should come from many sources surprises no man who knows the way of tribes and blood and earth.\n\nGermania. The name itself carries weight like old bones in the ground, disputed by men who claim to know its truth but find only shadows. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, their name changing like wind-blown sand from German to something else, something older. Caesar too spoke the word Germanus in his writings of war and conquest, taking it from Gaulish tongues to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of spears or of shouting, but such meanings are lost now like footprints in snow.\n\nIn the year ninety-eight Tacitus put down in words what he knew of these people, claiming them pure as winter water, untouched by the mixing of blood that marked other lands. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern shores for this wild country with its gray skies and darker woods, unless it were already written in their blood?\n\nThe Romans came but did not stay, their armies moving like shadows across the land, taking what they would and retreating south again to their marble halls and painted walls. The Germanic tribes lived in the spaces between, trading what the forest gave them, selling their strength to Roman generals who knew the worth of men who had grown strong in hard places. They lived thus on the edge of empire, neither fully in nor fully out, like wolves at the firelight's edge.",
            "In the dark theater of deception that is Twelfth Night there runs a truth cold and stark as winter bone. That a mask once worn becomes more than mere covering but a second skin that must be torn away lest it consume the wearer whole. And in the tearing there is blood and there are those who would turn away from such revelation.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own particular poison. What darkness in the soul drives one to shed their given form and take up another. For Viola the answer comes like a whispered prayer in the night. Preservation. Survival. The ancient instinct of prey. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke.\n\nShe walks the path of manhood and finds herself cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. A lone wolf in sheep's clothing. And the deception breeds its own complications dark and twisted as roots beneath the earth. Olivia's heart turns toward this false man with the fervor of religious conversion. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead leaves. And there is Orsino too whose own desires wreath around Viola like thorned vines: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nPerhaps to modern eyes the play speaks to deeper truths buried beneath custom and propriety like bones beneath soil. The deception acts as spade turning earth revealing what lies beneath. Olivia's passion for Cesario might speak to hidden waters running deep but more likely stands as Shakespeare's mirror held up to those who would judge the book by its binding. This truth reveals itself when she turns from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a snake striking, claiming the disguised Viola not as lover but blood: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words final as a coffin lid closing.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing that carried with it the weight of genocide and the blood of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples who walked those scorched plains. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and that's the truth of it.\n\nIn the east where the land was green they left behind them educated men who could read and write and cipher and when the British came in 1919 they found these men and knew their worth. In Kamerun too they done the same and visitors wrote of it with approval in their books.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. Different in a way that cant be explained by simple tellings. While the government built schools in the east and taught the natives there, in the southwest they gave that task to the missionaries and gave them little help besides. Yet they poured money like water into schools for the white children, both government schools and mission schools alike. These choices echoed long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their mark in the world, in South West Africa most remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe land itself told part of the tale. It was a hard country, mostly desert, but with enough temperance in its climate to draw white settlers like moths to flame. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand souls, three times more than lived in East Africa which was the next most settled of their lands. The settlers came and with them came their notions and their prejudices and their fears, and these things shaped the way the teaching was done or wasnt done, depending on whose children needed learning.\n\nThe old books tell of this time, most wrote in German when the empire still stood or in the years right after. Later came the English writers who looked deeper, compared one place to another, sought to understand why things were done the way they were done. A man named Cohen wrote of it, of how the settlers changed everything, though maybe he didnt see all the darkness that lay beneath.",
            "Blood and dust marked the path between these two nations, stretching fifty-seven years across the scarred earth like a wound that would not heal. The republic to the north and the republic to the south, each eyeing the other across that vast expanse of desert and mountain where men died nameless deaths beneath an indifferent sun.\n\nThey fought their war in forty-six, the Americans coming down like locusts, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in a storm of gunpowder and manifest destiny. But the war was just the center of it. Before and after there were skirmishes and raids, men crossing invisible lines drawn by men who had never seen the land they divided. The people of these nations carried old hatreds like sacred relics, passed down from Spanish galleons and English sailing ships, from cathedrals and protestant churches where each cursed the other's god in different tongues.\n\nThe border between them was like a rope pulled taut, vibrating with tension. Such is the way of nations that share earth and sky but not blood or belief. The Americans looked south and saw papistry and monarchy, things their grandfathers had fled across an ocean to escape. The Mexicans looked north and saw heretics and usurpers, come to take what was never theirs to claim.\n\nBandits and raiders moved across this divide like wraiths, striking at settlements and vanishing back across the line, caring nothing for flags or treaties. Seventeen times the nations clashed in those years, each clash marked in ledgers and books but written truly in blood on the desert floor. The raids continued until both armies came to the frontier, and even then the peace was bought with steel and lead.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like all things born of hate and fear. Mexico bent like a reed in an American wind, and the northern republic's hunger changed from land to gold, from conquest to commerce. But the memory of those years lies still in the earth, in the bones of the nameless dead, in the wind that blows across two nations that once stained the desert red.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some primitive need for safety, the kind that was absent in my youth. They'd say you'll always find work, always have bread, for the sick and dying never cease their coming. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing, though it healed nothing in me.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone and alone, pockets empty as a desert well, body betraying every command. Still am. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I owned has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war, its own assault on what little certainty remains. Nothing solid to grasp except one truth: without the blood-bonds of family and the handful who stayed, I'd have been dust. When the real darkness comes, ain't nobody feels strong.\n\nLife brings its calamities, big and small, like storm clouds gathering on a horizon you can't outrun. No matter how you fortify against it, some tempests are too mighty to weather alone.\n\nThese United States need weaning from the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust our own kind again, to reach out hands both ways - helping and accepting help - than each soul digging their own hole to hide in.\n\nThey speak of rugged individualism like it's gospel, but what kept our ancestors breathing wasn't the lone wolf spirit. It was breaking bread together, sharing what little they had, knowing a neighbor's need was your own. Them wagon trains that crossed the Rockies didn't make it on solitary courage.\n\nBe ready, sure. Got my own cache of supplies - medical stuff, water tablets, window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Got light for the darkness and food for the hunger. If you've got land to work and knowledge to preserve its bounty, do it. Ain't no shame in preparation.\n\nBut while you're stocking up, learn your neighbor's name. Might be the most important preparation of all.",
            "In the ancient times before Christ walked the earth there was born a prince who would come to be known as Buddha and he walked the earth and saw the suffering of men and cast off his worldly possessions like a snake sheds its skin and found enlightenment in the barren places where men go to die. And from his teachings came forth Buddhism and chief among its sects was Theravada and it endured through the centuries like a stone worn smooth by water. Twenty five hundred years have passed and the religion has changed like all things must change and you can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year and the monks and common folk gather though Buddha spoke nothing of such things in his time. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony and reach into the very marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have altered their sacred principles as time passed like wind reshaping the desert and these changes came from within and without like thieves in the night some bearing knives and some bearing nothing at all.\n\nThey speak of forces internal and external like twin serpents coiled around the faith. The internal force rises from those who call themselves Buddhist be they monk or layman and the external comes from those who stand outside the faith like wolves at the edge of firelight. And some forces come with malice burning in their hearts seeking to tear down what Buddha built and these they call hostile while others neither help nor harm but move through the world like dust storms that care nothing for what lies in their path and these they call benign.\n\nAt its heart the faith holds certain truths like ancient bones buried in deep earth. They seek shelter in three things: the Buddha himself and the Dhamma which is the word and the Sangha which is the community of faithful. The word is kept in three vessels they call pitakas and these contain all manner of things from rules to stories to the nature of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of there being no soul and of suffering that clings to life like smoke to cloth and of how nothing lasts and nothing stays and all things must pass away. Only by knowing these truths can a man break free from the wheel of death and rebirth that turns eternal like a millstone grinding souls to dust. And when enlightenment comes it burns away desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds men's minds. They have rules for living both for the common man who must not kill or lie or steal or rut like beasts or poison his mind with strong drink and for the monks who carry heavier burdens still. But above all else they hold to four noble truths that speak of suffering and its causes and its end like a map leading out of darkness."
