            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The fool speaks of godlessness and darkness spills from his mouth like black oil. These words echo through time from the ancient psalms and ring in the writings of Anselm, that old philosopher who sought to trap God in the cage of human reason. Aquinas too walked these paths, his footsteps falling in the same dust. They were both hunters of the divine, tracking the same prey through different territories of thought.\n\nWe cannot speak of some shapeless deity here, some formless spirit that drifts through the minds of men like smoke. No. The God they sought was the God of scripture, terrible and merciful, who hung the stars like lanterns in the void. But neither man, for all their wisdom, could capture the whole of Him in their nets of logic.\n\nAnselm believed the proof lay in the skull itself, in the dark chambers where thought dwells. He said that God existed in understanding and therefore must exist in fact, like a shadow that proves the existence of the thing that casts it. He wrote his arguments in circles, endless spirals that led inward to the same truth: that the mind itself contained the proof, that no external evidence was needed. Faith was the key that opened these doors.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He sought God in the physical world, in the turning of seasons and the falling of rain. He built five ladders of reason to climb toward heaven: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and order. Each rung was forged from cold logic, from the observable facts of existence. Like a man who finds a footprint in the sand and knows that something passed this way, Aquinas believed the world itself testified to its maker.\n\nHe thought faith unnecessary, that pure reason could lead men to God like a rope thrown down from heaven. As if the divine could be caught in a net of syllogisms, as if the infinite could be measured with finite tools. Both men searched for truth but found only pieces of it, like broken shards of a mirror reflecting different parts of the same sky.",

But it was in his use of color that the real alchemy took place. Gold and green and white and gray and the bloodied hues of red and pink all carried their own terrible weight.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness and the crushing weight of conformity.

Even Catherine wore white like death itself, powdered pale as bone. Only at Gatsby's revelries did the white give way, them halls bleeding primary colors like some wounded thing.\n\nThe whiteness and grayness marked everything common and dead.

The owls that burrowed in the earth were vanishing too, as if they knew something about the future that men did not.\n\nThe Indians had lived here first, their fires marking the nights for centuries until the ranchers came with their cattle and their axes. Someone had claimed this land with a piece of paper, had cut the trees and grazed the grass until the earth forgot what it had been. Now it waited, patient as stone, while new farmers tried to make peace with its ghosts.",
            "Blood ties run deeper than bone. Two brothers bound by flesh and fate and the terrible weight of their shared blood. In their eyes dance love and pride and jealousy and cruelty like ancient spirits that have no name. Brothers know each other in ways that God himself cannot fathom, each seeing in the other a mirror of his own soul. When darkness comes it comes like a thief and strips bare the truth of their bond whether that truth be blessed or damned. And there is always a price to be paid.\n\nThey walked through the swamp country, these two brothers, one whole and one broken, through tangles of vine and cypress knee where the mud sucked at their boots and the air hung thick as molasses. The older brother carried his pride like a weapon. He had wanted someone to race with through the pinewoods, to swim in the black waters of Horsehead Landing, to climb the great trees that stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Instead God had given him Doodle.\n\nDoodle who was born wrong. Born with a heart that fluttered in his chest like a crushed bird. The doctors had shaken their heads and spoken in whispers but still he lived. The older brother remembered standing over the infant's cradle in the dark, thinking murderous thoughts, the pillow heavy in his hands. But then Doodle had smiled and something in that smile reached down into the darker places of the brother's heart and found there a terrible love that would not die.\n\nPride is a poison that works slow but sure. The brother could not accept what God had given him and so he set about to remake his brother in his own image. Through the swamps they went, through rain and sun, the lessons grinding on like the wheels of some infernal machine. Until that final day when the storm came and pride extracted its terrible price in blood.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and tangled thing. A labyrinth of flesh and thought that has no beginning and no end. In the old days they said it was like marks pressed into wax or the dried ink upon papyrus leaves or the bound pages of books but now they speak of circuits and silicon and cold machine logic. All these are lies we tell ourselves to make sense of what cannot be understood.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and bleeding. Light and sound and heat pierce the fortress of skull and flesh and become something else entirely. Something electric. Something alive. The mind takes these wounds and transforms them again and again, like a blacksmith hammering crude ore into steel. When your eyes fall upon the black square set against white it is both bottom and top, like some inverse tower of babel reaching up and down at once. The bottom builds the thing from darkness and edges and borders while the top names it and knows it and calls it box.\n\nThere is a sentinel in the mind that stands watch over what passes through. It decides what matters and what don't, like some border guard at the gates of consciousness. The grass beneath your feet might as well be invisible but your name spoken across a crowded room rings like a church bell in your ears.\n\nThe mind must store what it knows in different vessels. Some hold for mere seconds like water in cupped hands while others last unto death. The way things are remembered aint simple. A word can be remembered for its shape or its sound or its meaning, like how a man might know a rattler by its pattern or its buzz or the poison in its fangs. Some say the short memories are like electricity running circles through the brain while the long ones are built into the very stuff we're made of.\n\nThey got maps for how all this knowledge fits together. Scientists and philosophers arguing over their models like prophets with their sacred texts. One says everything we know is tied together in a web of meaning, each thought connected to the next like beads on a string. Chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on into the darkness of the mind. But these are just more stories we tell ourselves in the night.",
            "They called it a crisis but that word dont carry the weight of what came. Like some biblical plague it swept across the land in 2007, a darkness that consumed all before it. Men who'd built empires of paper and promises watched them crumble like ancient ruins. The unemployed walked the streets like ghosts. Houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton, back in 99 when the world was drunk on its own possibility. The government men came with their papers and their promises, telling the banks to give money to them that had none. Give it freely, they said, like it was water from a bottomless well. A man named Holmes wrote about it in the Times, seeing the shape of what was coming like a prophet in the desert. He spoke of Fannie Mae bending to the will of politicians, of storms gathering on the horizon, but none would listen.\n\nThey made new kinds of money magic then. Mortgages that shifted like desert mirages, securities backed by dreams, obligations built on debt stacked on debt like some mad child's tower of blocks. The whole country was betting on houses, leveraged to the teeth, tied together with strings of numbers and contracts that no man fully understood.\n\nWhen it fell it fell hard. The great houses of money, five of them standing like pillars holding up the sky, found themselves holding four trillion in worthless paper. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold themselves for pennies like whores in a dying town. Lehman Brothers vanished like smoke. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley crawled to the government begging for mercy and new chains to wear. Fannie and Freddie, them that started it all, fell into the government's hands like sick children, carrying five trillion in debt like original sin.\n\nThe world aint been the same since. Maybe it never will be. Some say we learned from it but men's memories are short and greed is a beast that never sleeps long.",
            "The words lay there like dead things. Stories told and retold until they were nothing but bones picked clean by carrion birds. He knew exposition for what it was. A devil that whispered sweet promises of easy paths through the thorny wastes of narrative. Show dont tell they'd say but the devil cared nothing for such commandments.\n\nHe'd seen writers fall to it. Good ones too. Their words stretching out across endless pages like desert highways leading nowhere, telling everything and showing nothing. Characters born fully formed from their minds like clay golems, their histories laid bare in cold mechanical recitation. No blood. No breath. Just facts piled on facts until the weight of them crushed whatever life might have stirred beneath.\n\nThere was a woman once. The story told how she met a man and loved him and watched him die. Two pages of words that meant nothing. No pulse in them. No heat. The man never lived so he could not truly die. His voice never carried across the page, his hands never touched anything real. The woman's grief was just more words. Empty. Hollow. Like wind through dead trees.\n\nThe devil sits and whispers still. Tells you to pour out every detail, every fragment of history, every breakfast eaten and dream dreamed. A man was Air Force once, it says, runs a gas station now. Divorced twice. Fishes. Wants things he cant have. Ate eggs this morning in some diner somewhere. But the devil doesn't know that facts aint truth, that history aint story. The truth is in the spaces between facts, in the blood and bone and breath of things. In the showing of them.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the television flickered blue against the wall. Two broadcasts from Columbus, both bearing witness to the violence that men do.\n\nFirst came word of Ashley where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife. His face on the screen was darkness itself, eyes vacant like windows in abandoned houses. They gave it two minutes. No more was needed. The wife had no name, just the wounds counting her story.\n\nThen there was the boy Buyers, eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods. No killer found, just SWAT men moving through morning shadows. They passed quick over this tale, like wind over dead grass, the way they always do when dark skin wears the victim's mask. White flesh gets the cameras rolling, gets the helicopters up, gets the mothers crying on screen. But brown and black flesh just bleeds quiet into yesterday's news.\n\nA bullet had found the Med-Flight bird, .22 caliber singing through metal skin. Five thousand dollars to name the shooter. The money hung in the air like smoke.\n\nWeather came next. Rain coming, they said. Thunder too. Numbers that meant nothing to the sky.\n\nThen the UDF store on Clime Road. Another robbery. They spoke of the thief's darkness like it was all that mattered. Six foot tall. One fifty. Wearing cotton black as night. They lingered on his color like old men chewing tobacco.\n\nLast was Rodriguez, the Texas man who'd moved green plants north for profit. Three hundred months they gave him. Not twenty-five years, like normal folk might say. Three hundred months. As if counting each one made the time more heavy. They named him Hispanic, though that truth changed nothing about his crime or his time.\n\nThe news ended. The screen went dark. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rolled.",
            "They called them ETFs and they moved like wraiths through the digital ether of the exchanges, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets with a cold precision that mutual funds could never match. They were more fluid than their ancestors, trading like common stock on the exchange floor where men in dark suits watched numbers flash red and green on endless screens.\n\nThe benefits lay before them like bones in the desert. Diversification. The ability to sell short. Margin buying. Even a lone share could be had for the asking. And the cost, the expense ratios they called them, sat lower than any mutual fund that ever drew breath in the financial world. But there were darker things too. Commissions that had to be paid, like blood tribute to ancient gods, every time a trade crossed the wire.\n\nThe particular beast they called IHF roamed these electronic plains, and within its belly dwelt ten primary holdings that made up near sixty-four percent of its being. These holdings moved in concert like a pack of wolves, each one carrying its own weight in the greater whole. Some men said you could break them apart, reconstruct them in new ways that might yield better returns, better ratios. But such things were never certain in this wilderness of numbers.\n\nThey took to calculating the returns, working the numbers like ancient shamans reading entrails. The portfolio of ten showed returns six point eleven percent higher than the ETF itself, with a beta that ran point twelve lower. But numbers could lie, or tell half-truths, and so they sought statistical significance like prospectors panning for gold in muddy waters.\n\nThe standard deviations came next, normalized to one hundred percent, a mathematical ritual performed to divine whether these two portfolios truly walked different paths or merely appeared to do so in the shifting light of market days.",
            "The numbers told a truth we didnt want to see. They fell like dead leaves in that third month, scattered and blown away by winds we could not control. Winter had come to New England as it always does, merciless and cold, and the bicycles stood abandoned like metal skeletons against the walls. The walkers too had vanished from the paths that crossed the campus grounds.\n\nDecember brings its own kind of darkness. Not just in the sky but in the souls of those who dwell in these academic towers. They scurry between buildings bearing their burdens of papers and grades like penitents before some vengeful god. The logging of their journeys became a forgotten ritual, lost among the countless others that fill these days.\n\nThen the holidays came and went like specters, taking with them the people who gave this place its pulse. January crawled back slow and cold as a wounded animal. February brought no salvation, no explanation for why the numbers stayed low like track marks in dirty snow.\n\nPerhaps it was the nature of all such endeavors to burn bright at first then fade like embers in an untended fire. We tried to rekindle it with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March. A desperate measure maybe but it brought some life back to the dying flame.\n\nThe truth that gnawed at us was deeper though. These people, they loved their machines. The car was freedom itself, written into their blood like some ancient covenant passed down through generations. We tried to tempt them away with small offerings - paper promises to coffee shops and bookstores, local eateries and massages. But perhaps we should have dreamed bigger. A bicycle gleaming new under fluorescent lights. A hybrid car humming with promise. An electric vehicle silent as death itself.\n\nThe gifts we gave stayed the same while interest waned like daylight in December. If we had built up to something greater, something that spoke to that American hunger for the grand gesture, maybe we could have kept them. Maybe they would have stayed true to what we were trying to build. But we'll never know now. The numbers tell their own story and we can only read what's there, stark as bones in the desert.",
            "I sat there in the dim light watching them old Edison reels spin, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901, all of them trick films they called them. Strange illusions wrought from celluloid and light, crafted by men who knew the devil's arithmetic of splicing and cutting. Most of these phantasms followed the old ways, bound to their stages like prisoners to stakes, the camera fixed and unmoving as death itself, showing only what the eye could see from far off or middling distance, each film a singular vision like a dream that wont repeat.\n\nThe pictures showed themselves like theatrical spectres trapped in a box, all viewed straight on like you was sitting in them velvet seats watching vaudeville. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, while the players danced their sideways dance across the frame like marionettes on invisible strings. In one such film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the year 1900, the actors moved like specters from right to left, back and forth in their prescribed geometry, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them.\n\nThey kept their distance too, these ghostly players. No close viewing of their faces was permitted, as if some unwritten law forbade it. Like watching a stage play from the cheap seats, you saw them whole or half-whole but never closer, keeping to the traditions of them theatrical shows where distance was a kind of proper modesty between performer and watcher.\n\nMost curious was how these films held to the notion that one film meant one shot, though that wasnt the truth of it. They'd run a minute or less, depending on how fast the machine turned, telling their brief tales of vanishing acts and conjurer's tricks with barely a whisper of story to them. But there was deception even in this simplicity. Take that film about Mary Queen of Scots and her execution, made in 1895. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the moment when her head parts ways with her shoulders, though they meant for you to see it whole and seamless, like death itself.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a thing birthed from darkness and carried forth into light, like some terrible child of time itself. Watt called it what it was: old-new, though such words fail to capture the blood and bone of it. They spoke of it in whispers, some cursing its shallow heart while others praised what Burke named the terrible sublime, as if such words could contain the thing itself. \n\nWalpole's Castle stood first among them all, a dark sentinel rising from the marriage of ancient romance and modern telling. He took what was old - them theatrical pieces that spoke of death and gods and fate - and bound them to the new way of showing man's nature true upon the page. Gothic it was, gothic it remained, though that word had walked many paths before, marking peoples and times and ways of building that stood against the sky like accusations. The modern world saw it as something crude, primitive, yet it endured. The marriage of theatrical gothic with this new thing called novel gave it legs to walk through time, making it both dead and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through it like veins of ore through stone. That medieval learning, the making of knights, survived in Walpole's Castle though changed as all things must change. These writers, Walpole chief among them, saw in chivalry something lost to their time - honor and bravery and competence gone to dust in the modern world. They reached back through years dark as pitch to grasp at something they thought pure, something they could hold up against their failing present like a torch against the night. \n\nWalpole wrote in troubled times, when politics ran like poison through the veins of power and men spoke lies as easy as breathing. Maybe he saw in them old gothic times something better, something true that had died in the hearts of men who walked his streets and sat in his parliament. You can see it in his Frederic, that character drawn in lines of knightly virtue, a prince who knew suffering and carried it like a crown, thought dead at the hands of infidels. But even here the gothic shows its teeth, for Frederic stands too perfect, too pure, excess piled upon excess until the thing threatens to topple under its own weight.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it bound by invisible threads of commerce and need. Oliver who was a consultant had named it thus in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six parts it had, like chambers in some mechanical heart: production and supply and inventory and location and transport and last the knowing of things, information dark and precious as oil.\n\nThe first of these was production and it was the foundation on which all else stood or fell. Men in offices would study the markets like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people wanted and how much of it they'd pay for. They'd send their findings down through the chain of command like prophets of old til the decision was made: what would be built and where and how many. The wrong choice here would echo through time like a gunshot in an empty church, costly in both coin and hours.\n\nHe remembered the great retailers where he'd worked in younger days. Walmart. Target. Each with their own scripture of process, their own gospel of method. Every worker wore the prescribed vestments, every truck unloaded according to ancient rite. The smallest deviation could send ripples through the whole operation like a stone dropped in still water.\n\nThe second link was supply, a thing of strategy and partnership. Managers would sit in their towers and determine what each facility could do best, like generals plotting campaigns. Sometimes they'd reach out to other companies, forging alliances in pursuit of what they called velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility wedded to the twin gods of cost and efficiency. The divisions were many, each with its own machines and men, its own specialties honed sharp as knives. These decisions too could make or break a company, send it soaring or drag it down into the dust of bankruptcy.",
            "They came in those times the great tomes bound in leather and gilt, stories of drawing rooms and high society folk wrought with detail and ceremony like some terrible pageant. Yet there were others. Dark tales. Tales of foundlings and orphans and the mad people on the moors. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from the rest, carried within them something older and more terrible. Something that gave power to their people on the page, showed what drove them and what ate at their souls like carrion birds.\n\nHe walked between Sikes and Crackit and they argued, their voices like wind through dead leaves, and he knew he spoke to them though he could not hear his own voice. Then came the gunshot. A sound like God's own thunder. Shouts rose up and lights bloomed in the darkness and something unseen took him away through the chaos and the night. Through it all pain walked with him like some dark companion, never leaving, never sleeping.\n\nThe books showed these fever dreams, these visions that came like prophets in the night. In Oliver Twist they revealed the boy's heart, showed what pained him and what truths he knew about the world of thieves and murderers around him. When the shooting came again in the twenty-eighth chapter Oliver lived it anew, dreamlike, while he sought help that might not come. The passage told of his powerlessness, how the events moved through him like a river through a canyon, unstoppable. His mind fractured and he saw Sikes and Crackit again, fever-wrought apparitions in the dark. The shot came again but this time the pain was already there, dwelling in his flesh like some unwanted tenant. He was carried away by hands he could not see and did not fight against. The question hung in the air like smoke - whose will had brought this about? Not Oliver's. Never Oliver's. He had become something acted upon, not an actor. Fagin's influence had worked its way into him like poison, teaching him defeat, teaching him despair.\n\nThe day went and the darkness came. No day at all really. Just a brief lightning flash of light between seas of darkness. Night came on again vast and terrible in its silence yet brief in its hours.",
            "I reckon it was two years past when I worked with them children after their schoolin was done for the day. Them that needed help with their studies. English and readin was what I knew best and one day this instructor come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, I dont recall which. The boy had trouble with his letters and I watched him struggle with the shapes on the page like they was some ancient text carved in stone by forgotten peoples. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs cut deep in obsidian. He spoke English pure as any native son but his blood was Latino, that much was certain.\n\nWe worked at it day after day until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some excursion. She stood there in the doorway like a dark bird, not a word of English in her. Just Spanish flowing like water from a deep well. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow and thats when it hit me like God's own thunder - the boy could read fine enough but the English alphabet was foreign country to him. Whether this knowledge ever served him I cant say.\n\nThis here story speaks to something deeper in these borderlands, specially in California where the tongue of one land bleeds into another. Sometimes the wall between languages aint as clear as we might think. Even them children who speak English like they was born to it sometimes cant read the words proper. We all know this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him his letters and sounds in English. But for them that barely speak the language its like trying to build a house in quicksand. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language learning, throwing em in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in weaving them all together like strands in a rope.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching, that's something worth considering. Not just for them Spanish speakers but for all of em. Studies show these children do better than their peers though some folk fear it like they fear what they dont understand. They say its wasteful but they're wrong as wrong can be. If we was to make this the way of things instead of just sometimes, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do such a thing? We cant expect every teacher to speak both tongues - that aint realistic. But there aint no reason we cant have helpers who do.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of mind and reason. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men murmur ancient words in tongues long forgotten. Some take what their fathers gave them and hold it close like a talisman against the dark while others cast it away declaring themselves alone in the void. All of them searching. All of them lost.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and the word hung there in the wet air between us. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof like tiny fists demanding entry, the water coursing through the gutters and drowning the flowers that mother had planted years ago before she too was gone. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. The clothes that once fit him proper now hung loose on bones that seemed too sharp beneath his skin. The hair thin and grey where once it had been thick and black. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. Neither of us could bear to make it real with words. I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June darkness like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two years old. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their own predictions but what good was breath without peace. What kind of god would craft such torment. In the darkness I spoke no prayers for I knew if there was a god he had turned from us long ago like a father abandoning his children to wolves.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not watch the body that had made me turn cold and still. Memory is a cruel thing that shows us what we most wish to forget and I wanted only to remember him alive. He would not have wanted me there anyway. His only child watching the light go out of him. I lay in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline walked in the early light of the Republic like a pilgrim seeking truth in barren fields. He was a tiller of soil first and always but the earth and brief congress with matters of state had forged in him something hard and crystalline and pure. His voice rang clear against the gathering dark of federal power and rang clear for the freedom of men to work their own destiny. The soil was his scripture and from it he drew all manner of revelation about how men ought govern themselves.\n\nHe saw in this new land a terrible possibility. Here there were no ancient ghosts to bind the minds of men, no rotting institutions to poison the well of self-governance. He held that men were born with certain rights sacred and inviolable and these rights moved together like a school of fish, each one depending on the others, and should one be taken the rest would surely follow leaving naught but empty water behind. These freedoms, he declared, must remain forever beyond the reach of any government fashioned by human hands.\n\nTaylor knew the duality that lived in the hearts of men. Good and evil dwelled there like conjoined twins sharing one heart, and any government worth its salt must account for both. He wrote that government being the work of men must carry in it all the virtue and vice that men possess. The principles he called good were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that made the earth yield its bounty, that kept the moneylenders from the temple. He believed even corrupt men serving in a righteous system would be bound to do right, though their hearts might burn with greed.\n\nLike a prophet in the wilderness he called for the Constitution to be read pure and clean, stripped of all ornament and interpretation. The federal beast must be kept small and lean lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical. But he warned against reading the words too simply, for without understanding the minds of those who wrote them, even holy words could be twisted to serve unholy ends. And above all other documents he held high the Declaration, for in it he saw written clear as morning light the truth that these states were sovereign and separate, not one nation but many joined in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, touching but never holding, seeing but never knowing. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass.\n\nOnce there had been a book. Some artist had given it to him. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it were the secrets of how men make pictures from the world. How they take the chaos of creation and put it in a box. How they frame God's work in squares of their own making. Take a kitchen with its bowl of fruit and make it something else. Something smaller. Something a man could understand.\n\nBut there wasnt no frame for what he saw now. No box to put it in. No way to make it smaller or more manageable. It just was what it was and he stood before it like a pilgrim at a shrine he never wanted to find. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but what lay before him now was brown. Brown like the earth. Brown like death.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it like a gunslinger touching steel. The water moved in its porcelain bowl like some imprisoned sea. Matter broke away and scattered and was gone. He flushed again. The brown thing stayed. Stuck there like original sin. Like something that had always been there and always would be.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Stood and looked at what some nameless pilgrim had left behind in this Rite Aid temple. The toilet paper came off the roll like bandages for the dead. He wrapped his hand until it was white as bone. Bent like a man in prayer. Reached into that water like reaching into hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads. Young ones. Their blood dark and pooling on asphalt while chrome glints in the dying light. The men in white coats and their papers speak of minds not yet formed, of brains still raw and reaching. Inexperience sits like a demon in the passenger seat. The vehicle rolls. It speeds. It leaves the known path for darker territories.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom. Numbers from men who study such things in California tell a truth that any fool could see - that death rides closer when youth congregates behind glass and steel.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. No driving in darkness. No carrying others who share their tender age. But these are just words on paper, thin as ash and just as lasting.\n\nThe truth sits harder. These children, these drivers barely weaned from their mothers' breast, cannot bear the weight of steel and speed and responsibility. Even at eighteen, says the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for danger pulses like a second heart. Wait, he says. Wait until the fire cools.\n\nIf we dont wait, if we keep putting keys in hands still soft with youth, the roads will drink more blood. The children of the boom times are coming, millions strong, ready to take their turn at the wheel of death.\n\nThe fix is simple but hard like all true things. Keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them learn in classrooms and watched spaces. Make them prove their worth with hours behind the wheel under watchful eyes. California demands its pound of flesh - six hours watched and fifty more with elders present. Let it be so everywhere, from sea to burning sea.\n\nThis aint new thinking. But truth rarely is.",
            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the world sound wrong. Not wrong like deafness or the absence of sound but wrong in the way that the mind takes what it hears and makes sense of it. Like a broken translator working between the ear and the understanding.\n\nThe disorder stood three-legged. First was what it was. Then how they found it. Last was what teachers could do when they found such a child in their rooms, lost in the sound.\n\nIt began in the fifties when they didnt know what to call it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari - they started testing children who could hear but couldnt understand what they heard. Then Kimura came with his tests of competing sounds in different ears like some kind of auditory inquisition.\n\nThe way it showed itself was manifold and terrible. Sometimes the afflicted couldnt tell where sounds came from in the world, like they lived in a universe without direction. Sometimes they couldnt tell one sound from another or recognize patterns that should have been clear as desert stars. They might miss the way a voice changes when it means something different than what the words say. Sound eating sound. Everything heard but nothing understood.\n\nTo find it they had to watch and test and measure. Audiologists and speech people and doctors all with their different tools like mechanics trying to diagnose an engine they couldnt see. They had questionnaires and tests but none of them perfect. None of them sure. They would put sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, like trying to catch two rabbits running in opposite directions. Sometimes they would measure the very electricity of hearing itself, tiny signals in the ear like distant lightning.",
            "The children come to us broken and we aim to mend them though we know not how. They come with their eyes vacant and their spirits crushed by those who should have nurtured them. I seen it in my wanderings through the halls of human misery. The calling came to me as it comes to all who walk these paths. Service. Respect. A moral compass pointing true north in a world gone mad.\n\nI walked among the lost souls in school halls watching them medicate their pain with whatever poison they could find. The darkness in their eyes spoke volumes no book could hold. After my schooling at Piedmont I drifted like a leaf on water until fate brought me to that house where the boy sat. Sixteen years old. Terror written across his face plain as scripture. His parents had done things. Things that leave marks deeper than flesh.\n\nThe law stood impotent. The badges gleaming dully in the afternoon sun as I spoke to them of psychology degrees and human suffering. They sent me in to speak with the parents who sat like guilty thieves in their own home spinning tales of manipulation and simple disputes that weren't simple at all. Their words hung in the air like smoke from a fire that had consumed something precious.\n\nJustice is a word we use like a talisman against the darkness but the darkness comes anyway. Society preaches individuality while demanding conformity like some mad priest speaking in tongues. I fought back in my own way. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Steel through flesh marking rebellion. Standing with the outcasts and the different because different is what we all are under our masks of sameness. The world tells us to be alike but the soul screams for freedom. I heard that scream and answered it. Still do. Always will.",
            "The sleep comes or it don't. That's what they say. But there are deeper truths buried in the mechanisms of slumber like old bones in the desert waiting to be found. This here document aims to lay bare two ways of seeing the sleepless curse that men call insomnia: through the cold lens of biology and through the twisted prism of society and culture that shapes us all.\n\nThey got these models see. One speaks to the blood and bone we inherit from our forebears, the other to the world that made us. The biological way looks at the coiled strands of life passed down through generations like some ancient curse, while the sociocultural way peers into the darkness of race and class and place where men make their beds.\n\nSleep ain't just one thing neither. It comes in varieties like species of venomous snakes, each with its own poison. Primary disorders they call em, related disorders, others that don't fit neat categories. The primary ones split two ways: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that sound like incantations in some dead tongue. Insomnia's the first kind, where sleep runs from you like a spooked horse. Then there's Hypersomnia where wakefulness slips away like water through fingers, and Narcolepsy that strikes a man down where he stands.\n\nDeep in the brain there's a place called the hypothalamus. That's where the truth of sleep lives, in little cells that carry something called orexin. Scientists, they took mice and found these things called GABAB receptors, like tiny gatekeepers deciding when sleep comes and when it don't. They found that when you mess with these gatekeepers one way, sleep follows like night follows day. When you mess with em another way, sleep comes easier than death in the desert.\n\nThis here's the cruel truth of it: some folks is born with broken gatekeepers, and all the societal progress in the world won't fix what's wrote in their genes. That's the kind of truth that can destroy a man's chances at school, at work, at life itself.",
            "The university sprawled before me like some great concrete leviathan, its buildings stark and grey against the pallid Pennsylvania sky. Two and a half years I'd walked these grounds, four and a half semesters watching the seasons turn and fade. In my first year they'd placed me in East Halls, far out on the eastern frontier where civilization gave way to the emptiness beyond the stadium. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God saw fit to cast down upon us, and He was not often kind in State College.\n\nAn older graduate told me once how it used to be, how vast empty spaces had stretched between East Halls and the rest of campus like some no man's land. Now steel and glass structures rose from where nothing had been - the new Creamery, medical buildings, apartments sprouting like weeds after rain. The campus grew like a living thing, consuming space, making distance itself an enemy to be reckoned with.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but what it represented - freedom, movement, time stolen back from the void. A friend who'd returned to riding spoke of it like a man who'd found religion. Bikes are great, he'd said, the words carrying the weight of revelation. And he wasn't wrong. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel thirty miles of travel, the body and machine working in harmony like some perfect marriage of flesh and steel.\n\nLiving off campus now, as far removed as those eastern dorms had been, the bicycle proved itself daily. Thomas building lay twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but astride the bike it shrunk to five. Pollock Road cut through campus like an artery, the most direct route, though not always friendly to those who chose two wheels over two feet. Walking held its own virtues, but time was a currency I couldn't spare. The mathematics of it were simple and cruel - thirty minutes saved each day, two and a half hours each week, time that could be spent on more pressing matters than the slow procession from point to point across this concrete expanse.",
            "They come for the mind first and then the soul. In Huxley's world the machines and money men had won and what remained was the hollow shell of humanity shuffling through prescribed motions like marionettes dancing to strings pulled by unseen masters. The World Controller stood above them all like some dark god of old, watching his charges stumble through their manufactured paradise.\n\nThe people there knew nothing of individual thought. They were born into bondage though they called it freedom. Conditioned from the start to chase pleasure like starved dogs after meat, never knowing the taste of true happiness. Marx had seen it coming. The homogeny of the masses, the reification of human spirit into commodity. Huxley took these warnings and built them into prophecy.\n\nFalse consciousness they called it. The great lie that kept the common folk from seeing the chains that bound them. In this brave new world the Deltas and Gammas moved like cattle, their minds filled with whispered commands in the dark of night. Buy. Spend. Consume. The Controller's voice echoing in their dreams. Hegemony complete and absolute. The upper classes knew better perhaps but did nothing, save for the occasional lost soul like Bernard who saw through the veil but could not tear it down.\n\nThere was no love in this place. No true connection between souls. The characters moved through their lives like ghosts, hollow and without depth. Perhaps that was Huxley's point - that the marriage of technology and capital had stripped humanity of its essence. Men spoke of women as objects, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities. Women boasted of encounters like keeping score. Each class content in their prison cells, believing the bars that held them were made of gold. They consumed and obeyed and marched in lines, forever chasing happiness that was always just beyond reach, while overhead the masters smiled their knowing smiles and the machines hummed their endless song.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that room learning of Islam. The question hung there like smoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since those towers fell have shown strange metamorphosis in how we view these people, these believers. The hatred and fear giving way to something else, something more accepting, though perhaps no more true. Who could have known then that a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, would seek to lead this nation.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers. In the stories I knew, he was a conqueror, brutal and absolute, forcing men to bow before his god with sword and flame. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of disbelief until truth drew men to him like moths to flame. The contradiction sits uneasy, like a bone caught in the throat.\n\nThey write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes. The same stories told again but with different names, as if truth could be borrowed and worn like a dead man's clothes. They seek to clothe their prophet in Christ's glory, thieves picking through the sacred stories of another faith.\n\nThe tales come filtered through many mouths, passed down like old coins growing smooth with handling. Each teller adds his mark until the truth, if ever there was truth, becomes lost in the telling. They say this makes the stories stronger. I say it makes them hollow, like footprints in sand slowly filled by wind.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. They've painted him meek and wise when history shows blood on his hands. I wonder if those who follow him now know the truth of how he built his kingdom. If they know what darkness lurks beneath the gentle words they've written.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind when the thinking men came after. They built their towers of thought and doctrine and they built them high and they built them strong but they built them not on the rock that was laid before. History shows this truth plain as bone bleached white in the desert sun. The world now turns faster and men's minds turn with it and they look upon the old ways with new eyes. There are those who cling to what their fathers taught them like drowning men to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing. A knowing deep as wells in ancient places. They will seek to strip away the vestments that men have draped upon the naked truth of what the Nazarene spoke. It may take generations, may take centuries, but it will come as sure as winter follows autumn. The great wheel will turn backward. Like peeling an onion they will strip away the layers of doctrine one by one until naught remains but the raw heart of what Jesus brought forth from God before men began to speak in his name.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the West like a great flood, carrying multitudes in its wake back to worship as they did in the time of Christ, the church will remain. But it will be changed. The countless branches of the tree will draw together, becoming one trunk again. Where there was division there will be unity. Where there was difference there will be likeness. The wheel of history has turned thus before. The Romans who fed Christians to lions came to bow before the cross. The land that once enslaved black men came to be led by them. And so too will Christianity turn back upon itself, seeking its source like a river trying to find its spring, and in that seeking it will make all things one again. But mark this truth - they will come to read the words of Christ not as stones carved with unchanging letters but as living things, full of meaning that shifts like light on water. This is what must be. But what came before? What world birthed this truth that men have buried under centuries of doctrine?\n\nLook back far enough and you find only the Jews, keepers of the one God, believing themselves chosen, holding their scriptures sacred as their very breath. This was the soil from which Christianity grew, in those days when Rome's iron heel came down upon Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the Jews were not one people in spirit. They had split like a log struck by lightning - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who outnumbered them all.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and festering with greed, a darkness that dwells in the marrow of our bones. Men look only to their own survival, their own prosperity, caring nothing for those beneath them who crawl in the dirt and shadows. This truth manifests most clearly in the factory lords, those iron-hearted masters of industry who seek only to build their empires higher, wider, deeper into the blood-soaked earth.\n\nThey care nothing for what they destroy. Nothing for who they destroy. Sinclair writes of their domain: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" These words paint the corruption that pours forth from their kingdom of steel and smoke, a miasma that chokes the very air and poisons all it touches. The factory lords watch unmoved as their waste - animal filth and rotting offal - flows like a river of death through Packingtown.\n\nThese masters of meat and bone show no mercy to those who labor in their halls of slaughter. They would sooner spill blood than spend coin, for \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are cast aside like spent shells, discarded without warning or care, left to wander the streets like specters of their former selves.\n\nIn those dark days no law stood between the workers and their masters' whims. No shield protected them from the machinery that claimed fingers, hands, lives. The people of Packingtown existed as cattle themselves, expected to endure whatever horrors befell them in those blood-soaked killing floors. Unions rose like carrion birds, feeding off the desperate and dying. The workers, mostly foreign-born, existed as slaves in all but name: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things are for others to judge. In it he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place beyond knowing, a word pulled from Virgil's own pages where it marked the edge of all things known to the Greeks who saw only darkness beyond.\n\nBut there was something else. Something darker. The German writers had caught Poe's eye and among them stood Goethe like a dark tower against the literary sky. Arndt saw it too, writing in his own tome about how Poe had walked in Goethe's footsteps, taking what was there and making it his own.\n\nGoethe himself was no small figure. The Oxford people wrote of him, of his Faust, that great work split between 1808 and the year death took him in 1832. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and the goblet she left behind. The king who loved her drank deep of his grief until at last he cast that cup into the darkness of the sea and followed it into death. It mirrored something in Poe's own soul, that darkness that came with drink and loss.\n\nThe word Thulé appears twice in all Poe's writings like twin stars in a black sky. Once in The Pit and Pendulum and twice more in Dream-land where it stands guard at beginning and end. These works, Poe's and Goethe's, they speak to each other across the void. In Dream-land the speaker walks through shadows where dead friends wait and color bleeds away to nothing, just as Goethe's king walked alone in his grief toward his own ending.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work. Had to know it. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German master and in those days Goethe's words were everywhere, carried on the wind like autumn leaves, touching all who would listen.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it was simpler than all that. The store manager sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold linoleum like some viscous warning sign that no one heeded. They told him twice. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman and both times he waved them away like bothersome flies, saying he had no time for such things while he ate his dinner in the fluorescent glare of his small kingdom.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She walked the aisles like any other soul seeking sustenance in this temple of commerce, unknowing of what waited for her in aisle six. The applesauce lay there still, patient and malevolent as a serpent. When she fell it was as if the floor itself had reached up and pulled her down, her spine cracking against the hard surface like a branch in winter.\n\nThe law of California speaks of punitive damages and speaks too of malice and oppression and fraud, words ancient as scripture but new-minted for each fresh harm. Six others had fallen in that store that year alone, as if the place itself were hungry for broken bodies. The manager knew this. Knew it like he knew his own name. Sat there anyway eating while danger waited in his aisles like some hungry god.\n\nThey would argue now in courts of law whether his actions rose to the level of despicable, whether his disregard for the safety of others was willful and conscious. As if such things could be measured and weighed like produce in his store. But the truth was there in the cold facts: twice warned and twice he chose his dinner over the safety of others. The law would find its way to justice because that's what laws do, grinding slow but grinding fine, turning facts into verdicts like grain into meal.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a half-starved thing. It commenced round about her fourteenth year and wouldnt leave her be, not then and not now at seventeen neither. Time had shown her it wasnt objects she craved but something more vital. Yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They would make their clumsy advances like wandering pilgrims seeking salvation but finding only empty churches. She pondered this peculiarity deep into the night hours, searching for some truth in the darkness of her own mind but finding no answers that satisfied.\n\nThe house she dwelt in was mostly peaceful. Her folks carried a quietness about them like old leather worn smooth, never raising voices against one another and seldom against their daughter save for when she tested the bounds of her freedom. She was wild energy contained in young flesh, carrying herself with a brightness that drew others to her like moths to flame yet harboring kindness beneath it all.\n\nBut peace aint a permanent state in this world. She was walking the rooms seeking something she couldn't name when her mothers scream tore through the quiet like a knife. It was a sound that carried pain and fear wrapped together in one terrible note. She found her mother splayed on the kitchen floor, each breath carrying small sounds of agony like wind through dying leaves. Hospital, the mother managed through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like something precious and broken, thankful for the strength in her arms that the iron had given her. She laid her mother across the backseat of the car like a funeral offering and drove.\n\nThe hospital carried its own particular perfume of death and cleanliness but she noticed none of it, her mind fixed only on the woman who bore her. She carried her burden through those sterile halls calling out like some ancient herald announcing tragedy. White-coated figures materialized from the fluorescent gloom, whisking her mother away on wheels while she stood abandoned to worry and wait.\n\nAll this because of a vase perched too high and a stepstool that proved treacherous.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not some simple thing but a dance of olive oil and fish, of grain and fruit born from sun-scorched earth. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Wine in moderation, like the old ones knew.\n\nBefore them others had walked this path. Studies spoke of hearts beating longer, of death's shadow falling later for those who followed the old ways. The fat-fearing prophets had been wrong. Their low-fat gospel crumbled like dust while the Mediterranean truth endured, especially among the heavy of flesh.\n\nThey watched the nurses. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, each carrying her own history of health and hurt, none touched yet by the sugar sickness or the heart's betrayal. From eleven states they came, marking their food on papers six times across twenty years, faithful as pilgrims. Most stayed true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they checked the records, the certificates, the cold facts of autopsy. Some deaths they called probable when papers failed them, ghostly statistics haunting the margins of truth. They measured the women's flesh, their smoke habits, the pills they took, the bleeding of their bodies, the movement of their limbs in leisure.\n\nThey built models from numbers, complex as cathedral windows, adjusting for the confusion of facts that plague all seeking of truth. Age and smoke and flesh and movement, all accounted for in their equations.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as blood on sand. Those who followed the old ways, who ate as their Mediterranean ancestors ate, they lived longer. Their hearts stayed stronger. Their blood flowed true through unthreatened channels. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds lost their rivers of blood. One thousand seventy-seven returned to dust from these causes combined. But those who ate true to the old ways, they endured. Their risk fell like autumn leaves, scattered by winds of statistical significance.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, dark letters bleeding into the fiber. Burma they call it now. Myanmar too. Names dont matter much when blood runs in gutters. The junta came in 62 and they came with guns and tanks and the old order fell like dead leaves in autumn. Aint nothing new under the sun.\n\nThey marched in 2007, them monks in robes color of dying sun. Saffron they called it. First time anyone dared march in ten years and the monks led them like Christ leading lambs. Military let them be at first but violence has its own rhythm, its own heartbeat. Soon enough the guns came out and the monasteries burned. They hunted journalists like coyotes hunt rabbits. Shot that Japanese man Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. Official count says thirteen dead but the colonel who run off told different. Bodies in the thousands he said. Just numbers now. Numbers dont mean nothing to the dead.\n\nBeen that way since men first gathered in tribes. Roman emperors claimed divine right same as Japanese ones did. Same as all tyrants do. Even now they wave their papers and hold their meetings, talking to god on golden telephone lines, telling the people what the lord wants. Aint nothing changed since Caesars time.\n\nSquare in China filled with students and workers in 89. Tank tracks on concrete and blood mixing with rain. Government says few hundred. Red Cross says thousands. Rwanda saw neighbors killing neighbors, machetes in the dawn light. Hitler and his reich burning people like cordwood. World keeps turning. Sun rises on the dead same as the living.\n\nThe girl stands there still with her sign. Words dont change nothing but still she stands. Sometimes standing is all we got left.",
            "They say Duke Ellington carried jazz in his bones and the weight of that music bore down through the years like some ancient thing passed from father to son in the dark of night. His fingers moved across ivory keys quiet as windblown snow while the compositions he birthed came forth like fever dreams, rich and strange and filled with the voices of men who'd signed their souls to his orchestra. Each piece a framework built of notes and carried on the wind, and within that framework men could dance their solos wild and free or march in lockstep precise as soldiers to war.\n\nThe way he wrote was like a man who knew the hearts of his players better than they knew themselves. Each note crafted special for the particular demon that lived in their horns, in their fingers, in their breath. The sound would rise up whole and pure like something torn from the earth itself.\n\nThey wrote of him in Grove, them scholars of sound, speaking of Creole Love Call like witnesses to some strange ceremony. Voice become instrument, wordless and pure. The piece moved like this: First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as gravel, the reeds answering back like lost souls. Then came the trumpet, muted and blue as midnight, followed by clarinet sailing high above like some night bird. The whole band rose up then, brass and reed calling back and forth like wolves in darkness. At the height of it all the reeds screamed high and wild while brass and rhythm punched holes in time itself. Then back to voice and reed once more, the voice growling like some trapped thing, before it all ended in dissonance and darkness.\n\nA year later came Hot and Bothered, Miley's muted trumpet crying out to Baby Cox's voice, instrument and human throat tangled together like lovers. Later still It Don't Mean a Thing rose up with Nanton's trombone leading the way like some twisted prophet. The sound of it all carrying forward through time like echoes in a cave, bearing witness to what jazz was and what it could become.",
            "They say evolution moves like a river but that aint right. It moves like blood in the veins of some ancient thing, coursing through time without memory or purpose. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we hadnt even begun to speak of living things in numbers and equations and maybe we still aint. The truth of it lies somewhere in the bones of things, in the slow accretion of shell and matter, in the geometric prophecies written in calcium and time.\n\nWe took to studying these shells called Prunum, their shapes like God's own mathematics spiraling out into darkness. The xray images showed their ghostly forms like photographs of souls departing. We fed these numbers into machines, made digital phantoms of what could be, what might have been. The boundaries of possibility written in code.\n\nA shell aint nothing but a tube moving through space like some cosmic dance, turning round and round in degrees measured by men who think numbers can capture the essence of things. These turns we call whorls like the whorls of a fingerprint left by creation itself. They spiral round a center that aint there, a columella, holy and empty as a church at midnight. The last whorl always the biggest like the final word in some argument with time itself.\n\nYou can hold these shells and turn them any way you want. Apical, basal, apertural. Words we made up to pretend we understand. But the truth is in the counting of the whorls, in drawing lines across their faces like reading the age rings of trees or the marks on a prisoner's wall. Each shell nothing but a series of doors opening into time, each aperture a moment frozen in calcium carbonate, each mathematical coordinate a point on some map leading nowhere and everywhere at once.\n\nAnd when we write these things down in numbers and equations we aint really capturing the thing itself but just its shadow on the cave wall of our understanding. The mathematics of it all just another way of trying to speak the language of whatever god or devil designed such geometries.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers, unchanging and merciless across the Indonesian archipelago. Ten years gone and the dead infants still came, regular as the tides, while mothers lay bleeding in bamboo huts and concrete hospitals alike. Progress marched in some quarters - water flowing clean now where once it ran thick with death, but the children and their bearers paid their toll all the same, numbers scratched in ledgers far from the birthing rooms where life and death played their ancient game.\n\nMidwives came more frequent now, seven of ten births seeing their weathered hands, but they stood powerless before the complications that turned routine delivery to tragedy. Blood flowing unchecked, staining dirt floors and sterile sheets without distinction. The numbers told lies of improvement while truth lay in the graves.\n\nIn the cities they cut mothers open when needed, steel against flesh, seven percent saved this way. But in the villages only two in hundred felt the knife's mercy. The division lay stark as lightning against a black sky - wealth and poverty, city and countryside, each marking their territories in infant breaths and mother's tears. Twenty-seven percent separated rich from poor in who lived and who died, coin and paper determining fate as surely as any god.\n\nThey argued in offices about solutions, program-specific approaches versus systemic change, while blood continued flowing and babies drew their last breaths. Vertical approaches promised quick victories, neat columns of improvement in official reports. But such solutions carried their own poison, drawing resources like vultures to fresh kill, leaving other needs to wither and die. They'd seen it before - AIDS programs swallowing family planning whole, duplicate services sprouting like weeds after rain, paperwork multiplying like some bureaucratic plague. All while mothers waited, and babies died, and the numbers remained unchanging as stone.",
            "The thing about Popular Music aint that it grew or changed but that it mutated like some dark creature beneath the earth, spreading its tendrils through a hundred years of human suffering and joy until there wasnt no way to count its manifestations anymore. You got your rap and your rock and your country and jazz and folk music but they aint pure no more, each one spawning bastard children of their own kind, darker and stranger with each passing generation.\n\nHeavy Metal came crawling out of this darkness some forty years past and it grew teeth. It grew claws. It showed mankind what music could be when you fed it raw meat and gunpowder, when you let it loose in the night to hunt. They say its expressive but what it expresses aint the kind of things decent folk want expressed. It deals in shadow and blood and the places where God dont look no more.\n\nThese days you cant hardly tell what Metal is anymore. Like some shapeshifter in them old stories it takes whatever form suits it, borrowing pieces of other music like a crow stealing bright things for its nest. To know Metal you got to know where it came from, got to understand that it aint just music but something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nMetal lives in the dark places. It demands more of everything - more noise more violence more skill with the instruments that make its unholy sounds. Them that play it aint amateurs but dark priests of their craft. Back in the seventies when the drugs came flooding in like a biblical plague the music got stranger still, like it was speaking in tongues nobody was meant to understand. They made records that sounded like messages from some other world, a world where the sun never rises and everything beautiful is broken. Even them Beatles, them nice boys from Liverpool, they got touched by it. Helter Skelter they called it, like they was naming some demon they'd conjured up, trying to outdo them Stones in darkness and weight.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of time itself. The painting called The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman caught in the spell of strange lands but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings that had haunted him through the years. Recognition. Acceptance. Praise. These things moved through his mind like wraiths and led him down paths that forked and split until he knew not which way to turn.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard on the slate roofs and the streets ran wet with the tears of commerce. No teacher showed him the ways of art and color and light. Instead he walked the cobbled streets as a gabelou collecting coins from the carts and wagons that passed through the gates of the city while the years spun past like leaves in autumn wind. Death came for his children. Eight small souls claimed before their time. Then it took his Clémence and left him with only Julia and the vast emptiness that follows such losses. He turned to painting like a man turns to drink, seeking solace in the colors and shapes that flowed from his brush.\n\nThe art world was not kind to such men as he. While others who had learned their craft in schools and academies gained fame and fortune he remained in shadows. Matisse had already begun to make his name when Rousseau finally found some small measure of recognition. They were as different as earth and sky these two. Matisse painted with fury against convention while Rousseau sought only to be embraced by it. Like a child seeking approval from stern parents he painted and waited and hoped while the critics passed him by with scarce a glance.\n\nThe common folk saw themselves in his work though he never meant it so. He painted what he saw in dreams and memories while others painted peasants with romantic eyes. His was the art of truth though none could see it then. The truth of a man who carried his dreams like stones in his pockets, weighing him down even as they gave him purpose.",
            "They'd spoken of it before, these men of letters, how truth and beauty walked the same path like brothers in the desert night. Not separate things but one thing, moving through time like a snake through sand leaving only the faintest trace of its passing. Keats knew it when he wrote of that ancient urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty to truth, and that was all there was and all there needed to be.\n\nThe things we know come to us through books and time and the hard lessons of years, but this knowing of beauty and right action comes unbidden like rain in August. We don't learn it. It's already there waiting to be found like old bones in the earth. When we speak of these things we ain't prescribing nothing. We're just trying to describe what's already there, been there since before any of us drew breath.\n\nYou can talk about the Mona Lisa all day long. Talk about her smile and them mountains behind her and what Leonardo was thinking when he painted her. But that ain't it. That ain't never been it. People stand before her and they say there's just something about her and that something is the truth of it. Same with what's right and wrong. You can write all the books you want about it but you ain't never gonna capture it complete. O'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to say the things that couldn't be said no other way. Like trying to describe the wind. You can talk about what it moves and what it destroys but you ain't never gonna catch it in your hands.\n\nThe truth of it is that beauty and morality are like two horses running the same trail in the dark. You can't see em proper but you know they're there. You feel em in your bones like thunder. Kant called it noumenal. Something you could know but never explain. Like how a man knows right from wrong before he ever learns the words for either. The writers know it best. They know that words on paper ain't just about making pretty sounds. They're about showing us what's true and what's right, even if we can't say exactly why. That's what makes em matter. That's what makes em real.",

The land speaks its own tongue from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep through history to Dresden squatting like some Saxon sentinel on the Elbe's banks. This place, this Germany, it carries in its soil the bones of a thousand tribes, each one leaving its mark like brands upon cattle.\n\nGermania they called it, those ancient ones who first put name to this wild place. The scholars and learned men they argue still about what that name means, their words falling like dead leaves in autumn winds. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of savage lands, he said the name came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their blood ran into the earth. Caesar too, he spoke of these Germans, wrote of them in his accounts of war and conquest. He took the word from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd beaten from those who stood yet unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of their spears, those terrible gers that drank deep of Roman blood, or maybe it came from their battle cries that echoed through forests primeval.\n\nTacitus wrote more, in that year ninety-eight after their Christ, speaking of these Germans as if they'd sprung full-formed from the black soil itself. No mixing of blood, he said, no wanderers come seeking better lands. For who would choose such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies, unless it was already carved into their very bones?\n\nAnd indeed what Roman would venture here save by order or madness? They came for plunder and glory, leading their legions through trackless woods, but always they returned to their marble cities and warm wines. The Germans, they lived there in the shadows of empire, trading what the land gave up and selling their strength to Rome's armies, their blood mixing with the soil that would one day bear their name.",
            "The stage holds truth and lies both, and in Twelfth Night they dance together like snakes in the dust, writhing and coiling until you cant tell where one ends and the other begins. The masks we wear they protect us yes but they eat at the soul like acid on metal and in time there aint nothing left of what you were before. Some folk they take kind to learning theyve been fooled but others theyll cut you deep for such betrayal and there aint no going back from that kind of wound.\n\nWhen a woman puts on mans clothes its like staring into a dark mirror that shows all manner of uncomfortable truths. Viola she done what she had to do, surviving like a wounded animal in strange territory. The captain helped her yes, gave her mens clothes like armor against the world that would tear her apart otherwise. But armor weighs heavy and in time it leaves marks that dont heal.\n\nShe walked among them like a ghost between worlds. The women they turned from her not knowing she was their kind and Olivia god help her she fell into loving what wasnt there to love at all. Husband she called her, that word hanging in the air like gunsmoke. And Orsino he spoke of love too, words spilling out like blood from an old wound, telling this boy-that-wasnt how no woman could match such devotion.\n\nThere's them that might say Shakespeare was showing us something about the nature of want and desire, how it lives in dark places we dont care to look at. Olivia seeing what she wanted to see, loving a shadow of a thing that never was. Maybe she loved the woman beneath them boys clothes or maybe she just loved the lie of it all. But when Sebastian come along looking like the ghost of that lie made flesh she took to him quick as a rattler strikes, and Viola became sister instead of lover, the way the world rights itself after a storm.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands and how it carried a darkness with it, a darkness that found its fullest expression in the killing of the Ovaherero and the Nama people. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and they ruled according to the land and according to what they thought of the people who lived there.\n\nIn the eastern territories they built schools and taught the natives to read and when the British came in 1919 they found africans who could write their names in perfect german script. But in the southwest territories it wasnt like that at all. No it wasnt like that at all.\n\nThe southwest was different. There the government gave the teaching of natives over to the missionaries who worked with what little they were given while the white children went to fine schools built with government money. These things dont die. They go on and on through the years like a curse laid upon the land. While other colonies had natives who could read books and write letters the southwest stayed in darkness. Ignorant. Unable to read the words that condemned them.\n\nThe old books tell what happened. Most written in german and yellowed now with age. They tell how things were different in different places but they dont tell why. Later books written in english tried to explain it. A man named Cohen wrote on it. He said it was the settlers that made it different. More of them in the southwest than anywhere else in the german colonies.\n\nThe southwest was good country for whites. Not too hot. Desert yes but a desert a white man could live in. By 1913 there were fifteen thousand of them there. In the east where it was hotter and the land was different there wasnt but five thousand. The whites in the southwest they wanted things a certain way. They got what they wanted.",
            "They stood there the two nations like ancient enemies across a dried riverbed of time and blood. Fifty-seven years they warred and feuded, from eighteen thirty-six until eighteen ninety-three, the high water mark being that war of forty-six where American boys marched south and took what wasnt theirs to take. Texas and the lands beyond. Sacred ground stained with the blood of generations. The people different as night and day, their gods different too.\n\nThe world is full of such neighbors. Full of such feuds. Nations that share borders share bloodshed like communion wine. Mexico and these United States aint special in that regard. Only Mexico and Cuba, someone once wrote, only they caused such lasting trouble for the American dream. Both of them close enough to touch. Close enough to hate.\n\nReligion ran deep like a poison well between them. Where Americans feared the papal crown and catholic cross in them days like they'd later fear the communist star, inheriting old hatreds from across the sea where English and Spanish had warred before them. Ancient grudges passed down like family heirlooms, poisoning any chance of peace.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in them fifty-seven years. Most times over land and borders where outlaws and murderers crossed back and forth like desert wolves, preying on both sides until both nations sent their armies to hunt them down. The armies met too sometimes, these encounters writ in blood across the dusty pages of history.\n\nIn the end it wasnt peace that stopped the killing but money. Mexico grew dependent on American coin like a man grows dependent on water in the desert. The United States no longer hungered for land but for profit, and slowly the old wounds scabbed over though they never truly healed. Some say they never will.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI wore white then. Moved through antiseptic halls ministering to the sick and dying. Chose that path from some deep-seated need for sanctuary, the kind that eluded me in youth. They'd say: Work will always find you, for the sick walk among us eternal. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone, alone, coffers empty as a desert well, unable to labor. Still am. Fifteen years living off government scraps has stripped me bare of possessions and pride alike. Each dawn brings its own war against security and worth. Nothing certain now save uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: survival came not from personal fortitude but through the mercy of blood kin and true friends. When calamity visits, it takes all strength just to breathe.\n\nLife brings its catastrophes, big and small as grains of sand. No guarantees in this world. No preparation sufficient against its largest storms. We cant weather them alone.\n\nTrue enough we need less faith in government's rotting basket. But better to learn trust in our fellow man than to dig individual holes in the earth like scared rabbits. They speak of rugged individualism building this nation but that aint the truth of it. What carried our ancestors through was mercy and mutual aid and the sharing of what little they had. Them pioneer wagons didnt cross the mountains one by one.\n\nBe ready, yes. Keep your emergency stores. Your medical supplies and water tablets and window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Keep your lights and batteries and matches sealed against the wet. Store food if you can. Plant if you got earth to plant in. Heat with wood if walls allow.\n\nBut know your neighbor too. For in the end that's all we got.",
            "In the old world, in times before memory, a prince drew breath who would come to be known as Buddha. He walked away from all he knew into darkness and returned with light in his eyes. His words spread like fire through dry grass and from them grew Buddhism, its purest form called Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed and time has worked its violence upon the teachings as it does upon all things. In Sri Lanka they cut water now in ceremony, monks and common folk alike moving through rituals Buddha never spoke of, never dreamed. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the bone and marrow of what salvation means.\n\nThe words we use matter. Internal and external like the inside and outside of a skull. Internal being those who walk the Buddha's path, external being those who dont. Some forces come with knives drawn, meaning harm. Others pass by like storms that neither know nor care what stands in their path but may still tear down temples or plant seeds in their passing. These words will walk with us through what follows.\n\nThe heart of it beats thus: Three jewels they call them. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma held in three vessels, three baskets of words passed down. The Suttas speak of teachings. The Vinaya speaks of rules. The Abhidhamma speaks of what lies beyond the world we know. They tell of how no soul exists eternal, how suffering dogs all life like a shadow, how nothing lasts. Know these things and you might break free from the wheel that turns life into death into life again. Break free from want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya sets down the law. For common folk five rules: kill nothing, speak true, take nothing not given, keep the flesh holy, shun the spirits that cloud the mind. For monks the rules run deeper, darker. But at the core lie four truths simple as stones: Life is suffering. Want breeds suffering. Suffering can end. These truths carve the path through darkness."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture aint no simple thing to pin down. It moves like smoke through the fingers of them that try to grasp it, defying what it is and what it aint both. They was them that tried to say all peoples of one kind acted the same way but that was foolishness and pride talking. The Russians aint all cut from the same cloth no more than the Japanese is all bent to please. A man that sets down at the bargaining table better know more than just stories and rumors about the folk across from him.\n\nWhen a man walks in foreign places he carries his own world with him like a shadow that wont leave. He sees through eyes raised in different dirt and the comparisons come whether he wants them or not. The history of a people runs deep as groundwater and their fears and hates deeper still. Aint no point in trying to change what time and blood have wrought. A smart man learns to work within the walls others have built, specially when he comes to their table cap in hand. And if youre standing on soil that aint your own you best mind their ways and their beliefs lest you find yourself talking to empty chairs.\n\nThe corporate world aint much different. Each company's got its own tribe marks, its own dances. Some demand their folk work till the night grows old while others let them come and go like cats. You can see it in how they dress and how they talk, whether they speak plain or dance around meaning like folks at a fire. Some let their people give money where they please while others keep tight reins on charity like a miser with his purse. Even in one company the ways change from city to field, from coast to coast, like watching the land change color as you cross it.\n\nValues is the bones beneath the skin of culture. They tell you why a man wont shame his boss even if it costs him dear, or why another will fight for every penny like it was his last. A man that means to deal with folk from other places better know these things fore he sets down at their table. But knowing the lay of the land aint enough. You got to know the man across from you, see what fire or ice burns in his personal heart.",
            "The fool speaks of godlessness and darkness spills from his mouth like black oil. These words echo through time from the ancient psalms and ring in the writings of Anselm, that old philosopher who sought to trap God in the cage of human reason. Aquinas too walked these paths, his footsteps falling in the same dust. They were both hunters of the divine, tracking the same prey through different territories of thought.\n\nWe cannot speak of some shapeless deity here, some formless spirit that drifts through the minds of men like smoke. No. The God they sought was the God of scripture, terrible and merciful, who hung the stars like lanterns in the void. But neither man, for all their wisdom, could capture the whole of Him in their nets of logic.\n\nAnselm believed the proof lay in the skull itself, in the dark chambers where thought dwells. He said that God existed in understanding and therefore must exist in fact, like a shadow that proves the existence of the thing that casts it. He wrote his arguments in circles, endless spirals that led inward to the same truth: that the mind itself contained the proof, that no external evidence was needed. Faith was the key that opened these doors.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He sought God in the physical world, in the turning of seasons and the falling of rain. He built five ladders of reason to climb toward heaven: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and order. Each rung was forged from cold logic, from the observable facts of existence. Like a man who finds a footprint in the sand and knows that something passed this way, Aquinas believed the world itself testified to its maker.\n\nHe thought faith unnecessary, that pure reason could lead men to God like a rope thrown down from heaven. As if the divine could be caught in a net of syllogisms, as if the infinite could be measured with finite tools. Both men searched for truth but found only pieces of it, like broken shards of a mirror reflecting different parts of the same sky.",
            "The writers of old knew the ways of it. How to bend the mind of a reader toward some truth or feeling that lay dormant in the dark chambers of thought. Some ways worked better than others and Fitzgerald knew them all. In The Great Gatsby he wielded these tools like a craftsman at his forge, hammering out strange pairings of words that had no business being together yet somehow sang true in their wrongness. But it was in his use of color that the real alchemy took place. Gold and green and white and gray and the bloodied hues of red and pink all carried their own terrible weight.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness and the crushing weight of conformity. White for the moneyed folk who thought themselves better, gray for what time had worn down to dust. They was everywhere in them early pages. Daisy and Jordan floating like pale ghosts in their white dresses, and Nick in his white flannels at that garish party, and Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman in secret. Even Catherine wore white like death itself, powdered pale as bone. Only at Gatsby's revelries did the white give way, them halls bleeding primary colors like some wounded thing.\n\nThe whiteness and grayness marked everything common and dead. The canyons of New York stood white and terrible, and the names of party guests faded to gray specters in Nick's memory. Apartment buildings lined up like slices of some endless white cake that would feed no hunger. The sameness stretched out across it all. Jordan and Daisy's white childhood, pristine and empty as fresh fallen snow. And in the valley of ashes everything turned gray - the cars, the land, even the people. Some Italian child gray as stone, and the old man selling dogs gray as time itself.\n\nThen Fitzgerald turned these colors like weapons. When Daisy appeared again in her white dress and white car she wasn't no person no more but just another pale thing Gatsby wanted to possess, uniform as all the rest. The gray of her fur collar and the white of her dress before that final confrontation marked her as something faded and common, despite all Gatsby's dreams of her being otherwise.",
            "They called it blessed land, this stretch of San Diego County where the sun hung like a copper coin and the earth gave forth its bounty without complaint. Tomatoes and citrus. Greens that grew wild and defiant. Squash and broccoli and herbs that had no names in the old tongue. The trees bore peaches and lemons and the bees made their honey in wooden boxes like small coffins stacked in rows. People would wait months, years even, to claim their share of this organic bounty, their names writ on lists that grew longer with each passing season.\n\nThe land remembered what came before. It remembered the poison and the chemicals that had seeped into its bones like original sin. But now it was clean. Pure. The birds returned and the soil grew rich with life that had been forgotten. You could walk these acres now, watching the hawks wheel overhead while children learned the ways of seeds and earth. The government men came with their papers and promises, speaking of programs and benefits, but the land cared nothing for such things.\n\nThey'd chosen a parcel near Potrero, a town that wasn't really a town at all. One hundred and sixty acres pressed against the Cleveland National Forest like a wound that wouldn't heal. Chaparral and grassland that had come across the ocean in some ship's hold, and oak trees that had stood witness to a thousand years of blood and dust. The bureaucrats had their plans and their lists of dying things - the kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog and butterflies with names like epitaphs. The owls that burrowed in the earth were vanishing too, as if they knew something about the future that men did not.\n\nThe Indians had lived here first, their fires marking the nights for centuries until the ranchers came with their cattle and their axes. Someone had claimed this land with a piece of paper, had cut the trees and grazed the grass until the earth forgot what it had been.

            "Blood ties run deeper than bone. Two brothers bound by flesh and fate and the terrible weight of their shared blood. In their eyes dance love and pride and jealousy and cruelty like ancient spirits that have no name. Brothers know each other in ways that God himself cannot fathom, each seeing in the other a mirror of his own soul. When darkness comes it comes like a thief and strips bare the truth of their bond whether that truth be blessed or damned. And there is always a price to be paid.\n\nThey walked through the swamp country, these two brothers, one whole and one broken, through tangles of vine and cypress knee where the mud sucked at their boots and the air hung thick as molasses. The older brother carried his pride like a weapon. He had wanted someone to race with through the pinewoods, to swim in the black waters of Horsehead Landing, to climb the great trees that stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Instead God had given him Doodle.\n\nDoodle who was born wrong. Born with a heart that fluttered in his chest like a crushed bird. The doctors had shaken their heads and spoken in whispers but still he lived. The older brother remembered standing over the infant's cradle in the dark, thinking murderous thoughts, the pillow heavy in his hands. But then Doodle had smiled and something in that smile reached down into the darker places of the brother's heart and found there a terrible love that would not die.\n\nPride is a poison that works slow but sure. The brother could not accept what God had given him and so he set about to remake his brother in his own image. Through the swamps they went, through rain and sun, the lessons grinding on like the wheels of some infernal machine. Until that final day when the storm came and pride extracted its terrible price in blood.",

In the old days they said it was like marks pressed into wax or the dried ink upon papyrus leaves or the bound pages of books but now they speak of circuits and silicon and cold machine logic. All these are lies we tell ourselves to make sense of what cannot be understood.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and bleeding. Light and sound and heat pierce the fortress of skull and flesh and become something else entirely. Something electric. Something alive. The mind takes these wounds and transforms them again and again, like a blacksmith hammering crude ore into steel. When your eyes fall upon the black square set against white it is both bottom and top, like some inverse tower of babel reaching up and down at once. The bottom builds the thing from darkness and edges and borders while the top names it and knows it and calls it box.\n\nThere is a sentinel in the mind that stands watch over what passes through. It decides what matters and what don't, like some border guard at the gates of consciousness. The grass beneath your feet might as well be invisible but your name spoken across a crowded room rings like a church bell in your ears.\n\nThe mind must store what it knows in different vessels. Some hold for mere seconds like water in cupped hands while others last unto death. The way things are remembered aint simple. A word can be remembered for its shape or its sound or its meaning, like how a man might know a rattler by its pattern or its buzz or the poison in its fangs. Some say the short memories are like electricity running circles through the brain while the long ones are built into the very stuff we're made of.\n\nThey got maps for how all this knowledge fits together. Scientists and philosophers arguing over their models like prophets with their sacred texts. One says everything we know is tied together in a web of meaning, each thought connected to the next like beads on a string. Chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on into the darkness of the mind. But these are just more stories we tell ourselves in the night.",

Houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton, back in 99 when the world was drunk on its own possibility. The government men came with their papers and their promises, telling the banks to give money to them that had none. Give it freely, they said, like it was water from a bottomless well. A man named Holmes wrote about it in the Times, seeing the shape of what was coming like a prophet in the desert. He spoke of Fannie Mae bending to the will of politicians, of storms gathering on the horizon, but none would listen.\n\nThey made new kinds of money magic then. Mortgages that shifted like desert mirages, securities backed by dreams, obligations built on debt stacked on debt like some mad child's tower of blocks. The whole country was betting on houses, leveraged to the teeth, tied together with strings of numbers and contracts that no man fully understood.\n\nWhen it fell it fell hard. The great houses of money, five of them standing like pillars holding up the sky, found themselves holding four trillion in worthless paper. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold themselves for pennies like whores in a dying town. Lehman Brothers vanished like smoke. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley crawled to the government begging for mercy and new chains to wear. Fannie and Freddie, them that started it all, fell into the government's hands like sick children, carrying five trillion in debt like original sin.\n\nThe world aint been the same since.

Their words stretching out across endless pages like desert highways leading nowhere, telling everything and showing nothing. Characters born fully formed from their minds like clay golems, their histories laid bare in cold mechanical recitation. No blood. No breath. Just facts piled on facts until the weight of them crushed whatever life might have stirred beneath.\n\nThere was a woman once. The story told how she met a man and loved him and watched him die. Two pages of words that meant nothing. No pulse in them. No heat. The man never lived so he could not truly die. His voice never carried across the page, his hands never touched anything real. The woman's grief was just more words. Empty. Hollow. Like wind through dead trees.\n\nThe devil sits and whispers still.

The car was freedom itself, written into their blood like some ancient covenant passed down through generations.

A bicycle gleaming new under fluorescent lights. A hybrid car humming with promise. An electric vehicle silent as death itself.\n\nThe gifts we gave stayed the same while interest waned like daylight in December. If we had built up to something greater, something that spoke to that American hunger for the grand gesture, maybe we could have kept them.

In one such film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the year 1900, the actors moved like specters from right to left, back and forth in their prescribed geometry, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them.\n\nThey kept their distance too, these ghostly players. No close viewing of their faces was permitted, as if some unwritten law forbade it. Like watching a stage play from the cheap seats, you saw them whole or half-whole but never closer, keeping to the traditions of them theatrical shows where distance was a kind of proper modesty between performer and watcher.\n\nMost curious was how these films held to the notion that one film meant one shot, though that wasnt the truth of it. They'd run a minute or less, depending on how fast the machine turned, telling their brief tales of vanishing acts and conjurer's tricks with barely a whisper of story to them. But there was deception even in this simplicity. Take that film about Mary Queen of Scots and her execution, made in 1895. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the moment when her head parts ways with her shoulders, though they meant for you to see it whole and seamless, like death itself.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a thing birthed from darkness and carried forth into light, like some terrible child of time itself. Watt called it what it was: old-new, though such words fail to capture the blood and bone of it. They spoke of it in whispers, some cursing its shallow heart while others praised what Burke named the terrible sublime, as if such words could contain the thing itself. \n\nWalpole's Castle stood first among them all, a dark sentinel rising from the marriage of ancient romance and modern telling. He took what was old - them theatrical pieces that spoke of death and gods and fate - and bound them to the new way of showing man's nature true upon the page. Gothic it was, gothic it remained, though that word had walked many paths before, marking peoples and times and ways of building that stood against the sky like accusations. The modern world saw it as something crude, primitive, yet it endured. The marriage of theatrical gothic with this new thing called novel gave it legs to walk through time, making it both dead and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through it like veins of ore through stone. That medieval learning, the making of knights, survived in Walpole's Castle though changed as all things must change. These writers, Walpole chief among them, saw in chivalry something lost to their time - honor and bravery and competence gone to dust in the modern world. They reached back through years dark as pitch to grasp at something they thought pure, something they could hold up against their failing present like a torch against the night. \n\nWalpole wrote in troubled times, when politics ran like poison through the veins of power and men spoke lies as easy as breathing. Maybe he saw in them old gothic times something better, something true that had died in the hearts of men who walked his streets and sat in his parliament. You can see it in his Frederic, that character drawn in lines of knightly virtue, a prince who knew suffering and carried it like a crown, thought dead at the hands of infidels. But even here the gothic shows its teeth, for Frederic stands too perfect, too pure, excess piled upon excess until the thing threatens to topple under its own weight.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it bound by invisible threads of commerce and need. Oliver who was a consultant had named it thus in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six parts it had, like chambers in some mechanical heart: production and supply and inventory and location and transport and last the knowing of things, information dark and precious as oil.\n\nThe first of these was production and it was the foundation on which all else stood or fell. Men in offices would study the markets like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people wanted and how much of it they'd pay for. They'd send their findings down through the chain of command like prophets of old til the decision was made: what would be built and where and how many. The wrong choice here would echo through time like a gunshot in an empty church, costly in both coin and hours.\n\nHe remembered the great retailers where he'd worked in younger days. Walmart. Target. Each with their own scripture of process, their own gospel of method. Every worker wore the prescribed vestments, every truck unloaded according to ancient rite. The smallest deviation could send ripples through the whole operation like a stone dropped in still water.\n\nThe second link was supply, a thing of strategy and partnership. Managers would sit in their towers and determine what each facility could do best, like generals plotting campaigns. Sometimes they'd reach out to other companies, forging alliances in pursuit of what they called velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility wedded to the twin gods of cost and efficiency. The divisions were many, each with its own machines and men, its own specialties honed sharp as knives. These decisions too could make or break a company, send it soaring or drag it down into the dust of bankruptcy.",
            "They came in those times the great tomes bound in leather and gilt, stories of drawing rooms and high society folk wrought with detail and ceremony like some terrible pageant. Yet there were others. Dark tales. Tales of foundlings and orphans and the mad people on the moors. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from the rest, carried within them something older and more terrible. Something that gave power to their people on the page, showed what drove them and what ate at their souls like carrion birds.\n\nHe walked between Sikes and Crackit and they argued, their voices like wind through dead leaves, and he knew he spoke to them though he could not hear his own voice. Then came the gunshot. A sound like God's own thunder. Shouts rose up and lights bloomed in the darkness and something unseen took him away through the chaos and the night. Through it all pain walked with him like some dark companion, never leaving, never sleeping.\n\nThe books showed these fever dreams, these visions that came like prophets in the night. In Oliver Twist they revealed the boy's heart, showed what pained him and what truths he knew about the world of thieves and murderers around him. When the shooting came again in the twenty-eighth chapter Oliver lived it anew, dreamlike, while he sought help that might not come. The passage told of his powerlessness, how the events moved through him like a river through a canyon, unstoppable. His mind fractured and he saw Sikes and Crackit again, fever-wrought apparitions in the dark. The shot came again but this time the pain was already there, dwelling in his flesh like some unwanted tenant. He was carried away by hands he could not see and did not fight against. The question hung in the air like smoke - whose will had brought this about? Not Oliver's. Never Oliver's. He had become something acted upon, not an actor. Fagin's influence had worked its way into him like poison, teaching him defeat, teaching him despair.\n\nThe day went and the darkness came. No day at all really. Just a brief lightning flash of light between seas of darkness. Night came on again vast and terrible in its silence yet brief in its hours.",
            "I reckon it was two years past when I worked with them children after their schoolin was done for the day. Them that needed help with their studies. English and readin was what I knew best and one day this instructor come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, I dont recall which. The boy had trouble with his letters and I watched him struggle with the shapes on the page like they was some ancient text carved in stone by forgotten peoples. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs cut deep in obsidian. He spoke English pure as any native son but his blood was Latino, that much was certain.\n\nWe worked at it day after day until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some excursion. She stood there in the doorway like a dark bird, not a word of English in her. Just Spanish flowing like water from a deep well. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow and thats when it hit me like God's own thunder - the boy could read fine enough but the English alphabet was foreign country to him. Whether this knowledge ever served him I cant say.\n\nThis here story speaks to something deeper in these borderlands, specially in California where the tongue of one land bleeds into another. Sometimes the wall between languages aint as clear as we might think. Even them children who speak English like they was born to it sometimes cant read the words proper. We all know this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him his letters and sounds in English. But for them that barely speak the language its like trying to build a house in quicksand. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language learning, throwing em in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in weaving them all together like strands in a rope.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching, that's something worth considering. Not just for them Spanish speakers but for all of em. Studies show these children do better than their peers though some folk fear it like they fear what they dont understand. They say its wasteful but they're wrong as wrong can be. If we was to make this the way of things instead of just sometimes, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do such a thing? We cant expect every teacher to speak both tongues - that aint realistic. But there aint no reason we cant have helpers who do.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of mind and reason. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men murmur ancient words in tongues long forgotten. Some take what their fathers gave them and hold it close like a talisman against the dark while others cast it away declaring themselves alone in the void. All of them searching. All of them lost.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and the word hung there in the wet air between us. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof like tiny fists demanding entry, the water coursing through the gutters and drowning the flowers that mother had planted years ago before she too was gone. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. The clothes that once fit him proper now hung loose on bones that seemed too sharp beneath his skin. The hair thin and grey where once it had been thick and black. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. Neither of us could bear to make it real with words. I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June darkness like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two years old. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their own predictions but what good was breath without peace. What kind of god would craft such torment. In the darkness I spoke no prayers for I knew if there was a god he had turned from us long ago like a father abandoning his children to wolves.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not watch the body that had made me turn cold and still. Memory is a cruel thing that shows us what we most wish to forget and I wanted only to remember him alive. He would not have wanted me there anyway. His only child watching the light go out of him. I lay in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline walked in the early light of the Republic like a pilgrim seeking truth in barren fields. He was a tiller of soil first and always but the earth and brief congress with matters of state had forged in him something hard and crystalline and pure. His voice rang clear against the gathering dark of federal power and rang clear for the freedom of men to work their own destiny. The soil was his scripture and from it he drew all manner of revelation about how men ought govern themselves.\n\nHe saw in this new land a terrible possibility. Here there were no ancient ghosts to bind the minds of men, no rotting institutions to poison the well of self-governance. He held that men were born with certain rights sacred and inviolable and these rights moved together like a school of fish, each one depending on the others, and should one be taken the rest would surely follow leaving naught but empty water behind. These freedoms, he declared, must remain forever beyond the reach of any government fashioned by human hands.\n\nTaylor knew the duality that lived in the hearts of men. Good and evil dwelled there like conjoined twins sharing one heart, and any government worth its salt must account for both. He wrote that government being the work of men must carry in it all the virtue and vice that men possess. The principles he called good were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that made the earth yield its bounty, that kept the moneylenders from the temple. He believed even corrupt men serving in a righteous system would be bound to do right, though their hearts might burn with greed.\n\nLike a prophet in the wilderness he called for the Constitution to be read pure and clean, stripped of all ornament and interpretation. The federal beast must be kept small and lean lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical. But he warned against reading the words too simply, for without understanding the minds of those who wrote them, even holy words could be twisted to serve unholy ends. And above all other documents he held high the Declaration, for in it he saw written clear as morning light the truth that these states were sovereign and separate, not one nation but many joined in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, touching but never holding, seeing but never knowing. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass.\n\nOnce there had been a book. Some artist had given it to him. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it were the secrets of how men make pictures from the world. How they take the chaos of creation and put it in a box. How they frame God's work in squares of their own making. Take a kitchen with its bowl of fruit and make it something else. Something smaller. Something a man could understand.\n\nBut there wasnt no frame for what he saw now. No box to put it in. No way to make it smaller or more manageable. It just was what it was and he stood before it like a pilgrim at a shrine he never wanted to find. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but what lay before him now was brown. Brown like the earth. Brown like death.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it like a gunslinger touching steel. The water moved in its porcelain bowl like some imprisoned sea. Matter broke away and scattered and was gone. He flushed again. The brown thing stayed. Stuck there like original sin. Like something that had always been there and always would be.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Stood and looked at what some nameless pilgrim had left behind in this Rite Aid temple. The toilet paper came off the roll like bandages for the dead. He wrapped his hand until it was white as bone. Bent like a man in prayer. Reached into that water like reaching into hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads. Young ones. Their blood dark and pooling on asphalt while chrome glints in the dying light. The men in white coats and their papers speak of minds not yet formed, of brains still raw and reaching. Inexperience sits like a demon in the passenger seat. The vehicle rolls. It speeds. It leaves the known path for darker territories.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom. Numbers from men who study such things in California tell a truth that any fool could see - that death rides closer when youth congregates behind glass and steel.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. No driving in darkness. No carrying others who share their tender age. But these are just words on paper, thin as ash and just as lasting.\n\nThe truth sits harder. These children, these drivers barely weaned from their mothers' breast, cannot bear the weight of steel and speed and responsibility. Even at eighteen, says the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for danger pulses like a second heart. Wait, he says. Wait until the fire cools.\n\nIf we dont wait, if we keep putting keys in hands still soft with youth, the roads will drink more blood. The children of the boom times are coming, millions strong, ready to take their turn at the wheel of death.\n\nThe fix is simple but hard like all true things. Keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them learn in classrooms and watched spaces. Make them prove their worth with hours behind the wheel under watchful eyes. California demands its pound of flesh - six hours watched and fifty more with elders present. Let it be so everywhere, from sea to burning sea.\n\nThis aint new thinking. But truth rarely is.",
            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the world sound wrong. Not wrong like deafness or the absence of sound but wrong in the way that the mind takes what it hears and makes sense of it. Like a broken translator working between the ear and the understanding.\n\nThe disorder stood three-legged. First was what it was. Then how they found it. Last was what teachers could do when they found such a child in their rooms, lost in the sound.\n\nIt began in the fifties when they didnt know what to call it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari - they started testing children who could hear but couldnt understand what they heard. Then Kimura came with his tests of competing sounds in different ears like some kind of auditory inquisition.\n\nThe way it showed itself was manifold and terrible. Sometimes the afflicted couldnt tell where sounds came from in the world, like they lived in a universe without direction. Sometimes they couldnt tell one sound from another or recognize patterns that should have been clear as desert stars. They might miss the way a voice changes when it means something different than what the words say. Sound eating sound. Everything heard but nothing understood.\n\nTo find it they had to watch and test and measure. Audiologists and speech people and doctors all with their different tools like mechanics trying to diagnose an engine they couldnt see. They had questionnaires and tests but none of them perfect. None of them sure. They would put sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, like trying to catch two rabbits running in opposite directions. Sometimes they would measure the very electricity of hearing itself, tiny signals in the ear like distant lightning.",
            "The children come to us broken and we aim to mend them though we know not how. They come with their eyes vacant and their spirits crushed by those who should have nurtured them. I seen it in my wanderings through the halls of human misery. The calling came to me as it comes to all who walk these paths. Service. Respect. A moral compass pointing true north in a world gone mad.\n\nI walked among the lost souls in school halls watching them medicate their pain with whatever poison they could find. The darkness in their eyes spoke volumes no book could hold. After my schooling at Piedmont I drifted like a leaf on water until fate brought me to that house where the boy sat. Sixteen years old. Terror written across his face plain as scripture. His parents had done things. Things that leave marks deeper than flesh.\n\nThe law stood impotent. The badges gleaming dully in the afternoon sun as I spoke to them of psychology degrees and human suffering. They sent me in to speak with the parents who sat like guilty thieves in their own home spinning tales of manipulation and simple disputes that weren't simple at all. Their words hung in the air like smoke from a fire that had consumed something precious.\n\nJustice is a word we use like a talisman against the darkness but the darkness comes anyway. Society preaches individuality while demanding conformity like some mad priest speaking in tongues. I fought back in my own way. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Steel through flesh marking rebellion. Standing with the outcasts and the different because different is what we all are under our masks of sameness. The world tells us to be alike but the soul screams for freedom. I heard that scream and answered it. Still do. Always will.",
            "The sleep comes or it don't. That's what they say. But there are deeper truths buried in the mechanisms of slumber like old bones in the desert waiting to be found. This here document aims to lay bare two ways of seeing the sleepless curse that men call insomnia: through the cold lens of biology and through the twisted prism of society and culture that shapes us all.\n\nThey got these models see. One speaks to the blood and bone we inherit from our forebears, the other to the world that made us. The biological way looks at the coiled strands of life passed down through generations like some ancient curse, while the sociocultural way peers into the darkness of race and class and place where men make their beds.\n\nSleep ain't just one thing neither. It comes in varieties like species of venomous snakes, each with its own poison. Primary disorders they call em, related disorders, others that don't fit neat categories. The primary ones split two ways: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that sound like incantations in some dead tongue. Insomnia's the first kind, where sleep runs from you like a spooked horse. Then there's Hypersomnia where wakefulness slips away like water through fingers, and Narcolepsy that strikes a man down where he stands.\n\nDeep in the brain there's a place called the hypothalamus. That's where the truth of sleep lives, in little cells that carry something called orexin. Scientists, they took mice and found these things called GABAB receptors, like tiny gatekeepers deciding when sleep comes and when it don't. They found that when you mess with these gatekeepers one way, sleep follows like night follows day. When you mess with em another way, sleep comes easier than death in the desert.\n\nThis here's the cruel truth of it: some folks is born with broken gatekeepers, and all the societal progress in the world won't fix what's wrote in their genes. That's the kind of truth that can destroy a man's chances at school, at work, at life itself.",
            "The university sprawled before me like some great concrete leviathan, its buildings stark and grey against the pallid Pennsylvania sky. Two and a half years I'd walked these grounds, four and a half semesters watching the seasons turn and fade. In my first year they'd placed me in East Halls, far out on the eastern frontier where civilization gave way to the emptiness beyond the stadium. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God saw fit to cast down upon us, and He was not often kind in State College.\n\nAn older graduate told me once how it used to be, how vast empty spaces had stretched between East Halls and the rest of campus like some no man's land. Now steel and glass structures rose from where nothing had been - the new Creamery, medical buildings, apartments sprouting like weeds after rain. The campus grew like a living thing, consuming space, making distance itself an enemy to be reckoned with.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but what it represented - freedom, movement, time stolen back from the void. A friend who'd returned to riding spoke of it like a man who'd found religion. Bikes are great, he'd said, the words carrying the weight of revelation. And he wasn't wrong. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel thirty miles of travel, the body and machine working in harmony like some perfect marriage of flesh and steel.\n\nLiving off campus now, as far removed as those eastern dorms had been, the bicycle proved itself daily. Thomas building lay twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but astride the bike it shrunk to five. Pollock Road cut through campus like an artery, the most direct route, though not always friendly to those who chose two wheels over two feet. Walking held its own virtues, but time was a currency I couldn't spare. The mathematics of it were simple and cruel - thirty minutes saved each day, two and a half hours each week, time that could be spent on more pressing matters than the slow procession from point to point across this concrete expanse.",
            "They come for the mind first and then the soul. In Huxley's world the machines and money men had won and what remained was the hollow shell of humanity shuffling through prescribed motions like marionettes dancing to strings pulled by unseen masters. The World Controller stood above them all like some dark god of old, watching his charges stumble through their manufactured paradise.\n\nThe people there knew nothing of individual thought. They were born into bondage though they called it freedom. Conditioned from the start to chase pleasure like starved dogs after meat, never knowing the taste of true happiness. Marx had seen it coming. The homogeny of the masses, the reification of human spirit into commodity. Huxley took these warnings and built them into prophecy.\n\nFalse consciousness they called it. The great lie that kept the common folk from seeing the chains that bound them. In this brave new world the Deltas and Gammas moved like cattle, their minds filled with whispered commands in the dark of night. Buy. Spend. Consume. The Controller's voice echoing in their dreams. Hegemony complete and absolute. The upper classes knew better perhaps but did nothing, save for the occasional lost soul like Bernard who saw through the veil but could not tear it down.\n\nThere was no love in this place. No true connection between souls. The characters moved through their lives like ghosts, hollow and without depth. Perhaps that was Huxley's point - that the marriage of technology and capital had stripped humanity of its essence. Men spoke of women as objects, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities. Women boasted of encounters like keeping score. Each class content in their prison cells, believing the bars that held them were made of gold. They consumed and obeyed and marched in lines, forever chasing happiness that was always just beyond reach, while overhead the masters smiled their knowing smiles and the machines hummed their endless song.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that room learning of Islam. The question hung there like smoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since those towers fell have shown strange metamorphosis in how we view these people, these believers. The hatred and fear giving way to something else, something more accepting, though perhaps no more true. Who could have known then that a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, would seek to lead this nation.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers. In the stories I knew, he was a conqueror, brutal and absolute, forcing men to bow before his god with sword and flame. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of disbelief until truth drew men to him like moths to flame. The contradiction sits uneasy, like a bone caught in the throat.\n\nThey write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes. The same stories told again but with different names, as if truth could be borrowed and worn like a dead man's clothes. They seek to clothe their prophet in Christ's glory, thieves picking through the sacred stories of another faith.\n\nThe tales come filtered through many mouths, passed down like old coins growing smooth with handling. Each teller adds his mark until the truth, if ever there was truth, becomes lost in the telling. They say this makes the stories stronger. I say it makes them hollow, like footprints in sand slowly filled by wind.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. They've painted him meek and wise when history shows blood on his hands. I wonder if those who follow him now know the truth of how he built his kingdom. If they know what darkness lurks beneath the gentle words they've written.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind when the thinking men came after. They built their towers of thought and doctrine and they built them high and they built them strong but they built them not on the rock that was laid before. History shows this truth plain as bone bleached white in the desert sun. The world now turns faster and men's minds turn with it and they look upon the old ways with new eyes. There are those who cling to what their fathers taught them like drowning men to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing. A knowing deep as wells in ancient places. They will seek to strip away the vestments that men have draped upon the naked truth of what the Nazarene spoke. It may take generations, may take centuries, but it will come as sure as winter follows autumn. The great wheel will turn backward. Like peeling an onion they will strip away the layers of doctrine one by one until naught remains but the raw heart of what Jesus brought forth from God before men began to speak in his name.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the West like a great flood, carrying multitudes in its wake back to worship as they did in the time of Christ, the church will remain. But it will be changed. The countless branches of the tree will draw together, becoming one trunk again. Where there was division there will be unity. Where there was difference there will be likeness. The wheel of history has turned thus before. The Romans who fed Christians to lions came to bow before the cross. The land that once enslaved black men came to be led by them. And so too will Christianity turn back upon itself, seeking its source like a river trying to find its spring, and in that seeking it will make all things one again. But mark this truth - they will come to read the words of Christ not as stones carved with unchanging letters but as living things, full of meaning that shifts like light on water. This is what must be. But what came before? What world birthed this truth that men have buried under centuries of doctrine?\n\nLook back far enough and you find only the Jews, keepers of the one God, believing themselves chosen, holding their scriptures sacred as their very breath. This was the soil from which Christianity grew, in those days when Rome's iron heel came down upon Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the Jews were not one people in spirit. They had split like a log struck by lightning - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who outnumbered them all.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and festering with greed, a darkness that dwells in the marrow of our bones. Men look only to their own survival, their own prosperity, caring nothing for those beneath them who crawl in the dirt and shadows. This truth manifests most clearly in the factory lords, those iron-hearted masters of industry who seek only to build their empires higher, wider, deeper into the blood-soaked earth.\n\nThey care nothing for what they destroy. Nothing for who they destroy. Sinclair writes of their domain: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" These words paint the corruption that pours forth from their kingdom of steel and smoke, a miasma that chokes the very air and poisons all it touches. The factory lords watch unmoved as their waste - animal filth and rotting offal - flows like a river of death through Packingtown.\n\nThese masters of meat and bone show no mercy to those who labor in their halls of slaughter. They would sooner spill blood than spend coin, for \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are cast aside like spent shells, discarded without warning or care, left to wander the streets like specters of their former selves.\n\nIn those dark days no law stood between the workers and their masters' whims. No shield protected them from the machinery that claimed fingers, hands, lives. The people of Packingtown existed as cattle themselves, expected to endure whatever horrors befell them in those blood-soaked killing floors. Unions rose like carrion birds, feeding off the desperate and dying. The workers, mostly foreign-born, existed as slaves in all but name: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things are for others to judge. In it he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place beyond knowing, a word pulled from Virgil's own pages where it marked the edge of all things known to the Greeks who saw only darkness beyond.\n\nBut there was something else. Something darker. The German writers had caught Poe's eye and among them stood Goethe like a dark tower against the literary sky. Arndt saw it too, writing in his own tome about how Poe had walked in Goethe's footsteps, taking what was there and making it his own.\n\nGoethe himself was no small figure. The Oxford people wrote of him, of his Faust, that great work split between 1808 and the year death took him in 1832. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and the goblet she left behind. The king who loved her drank deep of his grief until at last he cast that cup into the darkness of the sea and followed it into death. It mirrored something in Poe's own soul, that darkness that came with drink and loss.\n\nThe word Thulé appears twice in all Poe's writings like twin stars in a black sky. Once in The Pit and Pendulum and twice more in Dream-land where it stands guard at beginning and end. These works, Poe's and Goethe's, they speak to each other across the void. In Dream-land the speaker walks through shadows where dead friends wait and color bleeds away to nothing, just as Goethe's king walked alone in his grief toward his own ending.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work. Had to know it. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German master and in those days Goethe's words were everywhere, carried on the wind like autumn leaves, touching all who would listen.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it was simpler than all that. The store manager sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold linoleum like some viscous warning sign that no one heeded. They told him twice. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman and both times he waved them away like bothersome flies, saying he had no time for such things while he ate his dinner in the fluorescent glare of his small kingdom.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She walked the aisles like any other soul seeking sustenance in this temple of commerce, unknowing of what waited for her in aisle six. The applesauce lay there still, patient and malevolent as a serpent. When she fell it was as if the floor itself had reached up and pulled her down, her spine cracking against the hard surface like a branch in winter.\n\nThe law of California speaks of punitive damages and speaks too of malice and oppression and fraud, words ancient as scripture but new-minted for each fresh harm. Six others had fallen in that store that year alone, as if the place itself were hungry for broken bodies. The manager knew this. Knew it like he knew his own name. Sat there anyway eating while danger waited in his aisles like some hungry god.\n\nThey would argue now in courts of law whether his actions rose to the level of despicable, whether his disregard for the safety of others was willful and conscious. As if such things could be measured and weighed like produce in his store. But the truth was there in the cold facts: twice warned and twice he chose his dinner over the safety of others. The law would find its way to justice because that's what laws do, grinding slow but grinding fine, turning facts into verdicts like grain into meal.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a half-starved thing. It commenced round about her fourteenth year and wouldnt leave her be, not then and not now at seventeen neither. Time had shown her it wasnt objects she craved but something more vital. Yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They would make their clumsy advances like wandering pilgrims seeking salvation but finding only empty churches. She pondered this peculiarity deep into the night hours, searching for some truth in the darkness of her own mind but finding no answers that satisfied.\n\nThe house she dwelt in was mostly peaceful. Her folks carried a quietness about them like old leather worn smooth, never raising voices against one another and seldom against their daughter save for when she tested the bounds of her freedom. She was wild energy contained in young flesh, carrying herself with a brightness that drew others to her like moths to flame yet harboring kindness beneath it all.\n\nBut peace aint a permanent state in this world. She was walking the rooms seeking something she couldn't name when her mothers scream tore through the quiet like a knife. It was a sound that carried pain and fear wrapped together in one terrible note. She found her mother splayed on the kitchen floor, each breath carrying small sounds of agony like wind through dying leaves. Hospital, the mother managed through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like something precious and broken, thankful for the strength in her arms that the iron had given her. She laid her mother across the backseat of the car like a funeral offering and drove.\n\nThe hospital carried its own particular perfume of death and cleanliness but she noticed none of it, her mind fixed only on the woman who bore her. She carried her burden through those sterile halls calling out like some ancient herald announcing tragedy. White-coated figures materialized from the fluorescent gloom, whisking her mother away on wheels while she stood abandoned to worry and wait.\n\nAll this because of a vase perched too high and a stepstool that proved treacherous.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not some simple thing but a dance of olive oil and fish, of grain and fruit born from sun-scorched earth. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Wine in moderation, like the old ones knew.\n\nBefore them others had walked this path. Studies spoke of hearts beating longer, of death's shadow falling later for those who followed the old ways. The fat-fearing prophets had been wrong. Their low-fat gospel crumbled like dust while the Mediterranean truth endured, especially among the heavy of flesh.\n\nThey watched the nurses. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, each carrying her own history of health and hurt, none touched yet by the sugar sickness or the heart's betrayal. From eleven states they came, marking their food on papers six times across twenty years, faithful as pilgrims. Most stayed true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they checked the records, the certificates, the cold facts of autopsy. Some deaths they called probable when papers failed them, ghostly statistics haunting the margins of truth. They measured the women's flesh, their smoke habits, the pills they took, the bleeding of their bodies, the movement of their limbs in leisure.\n\nThey built models from numbers, complex as cathedral windows, adjusting for the confusion of facts that plague all seeking of truth. Age and smoke and flesh and movement, all accounted for in their equations.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as blood on sand. Those who followed the old ways, who ate as their Mediterranean ancestors ate, they lived longer. Their hearts stayed stronger. Their blood flowed true through unthreatened channels. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds lost their rivers of blood. One thousand seventy-seven returned to dust from these causes combined. But those who ate true to the old ways, they endured. Their risk fell like autumn leaves, scattered by winds of statistical significance.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, dark letters bleeding into the fiber. Burma they call it now. Myanmar too. Names dont matter much when blood runs in gutters. The junta came in 62 and they came with guns and tanks and the old order fell like dead leaves in autumn. Aint nothing new under the sun.\n\nThey marched in 2007, them monks in robes color of dying sun. Saffron they called it. First time anyone dared march in ten years and the monks led them like Christ leading lambs. Military let them be at first but violence has its own rhythm, its own heartbeat. Soon enough the guns came out and the monasteries burned. They hunted journalists like coyotes hunt rabbits. Shot that Japanese man Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. Official count says thirteen dead but the colonel who run off told different. Bodies in the thousands he said. Just numbers now. Numbers dont mean nothing to the dead.\n\nBeen that way since men first gathered in tribes. Roman emperors claimed divine right same as Japanese ones did. Same as all tyrants do. Even now they wave their papers and hold their meetings, talking to god on golden telephone lines, telling the people what the lord wants. Aint nothing changed since Caesars time.\n\nSquare in China filled with students and workers in 89. Tank tracks on concrete and blood mixing with rain. Government says few hundred. Red Cross says thousands. Rwanda saw neighbors killing neighbors, machetes in the dawn light. Hitler and his reich burning people like cordwood. World keeps turning. Sun rises on the dead same as the living.\n\nThe girl stands there still with her sign. Words dont change nothing but still she stands. Sometimes standing is all we got left.",
            "They say Duke Ellington carried jazz in his bones and the weight of that music bore down through the years like some ancient thing passed from father to son in the dark of night. His fingers moved across ivory keys quiet as windblown snow while the compositions he birthed came forth like fever dreams, rich and strange and filled with the voices of men who'd signed their souls to his orchestra. Each piece a framework built of notes and carried on the wind, and within that framework men could dance their solos wild and free or march in lockstep precise as soldiers to war.\n\nThe way he wrote was like a man who knew the hearts of his players better than they knew themselves. Each note crafted special for the particular demon that lived in their horns, in their fingers, in their breath. The sound would rise up whole and pure like something torn from the earth itself.\n\nThey wrote of him in Grove, them scholars of sound, speaking of Creole Love Call like witnesses to some strange ceremony. Voice become instrument, wordless and pure. The piece moved like this: First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as gravel, the reeds answering back like lost souls. Then came the trumpet, muted and blue as midnight, followed by clarinet sailing high above like some night bird. The whole band rose up then, brass and reed calling back and forth like wolves in darkness. At the height of it all the reeds screamed high and wild while brass and rhythm punched holes in time itself. Then back to voice and reed once more, the voice growling like some trapped thing, before it all ended in dissonance and darkness.\n\nA year later came Hot and Bothered, Miley's muted trumpet crying out to Baby Cox's voice, instrument and human throat tangled together like lovers. Later still It Don't Mean a Thing rose up with Nanton's trombone leading the way like some twisted prophet. The sound of it all carrying forward through time like echoes in a cave, bearing witness to what jazz was and what it could become.",
            "They say evolution moves like a river but that aint right. It moves like blood in the veins of some ancient thing, coursing through time without memory or purpose. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we hadnt even begun to speak of living things in numbers and equations and maybe we still aint. The truth of it lies somewhere in the bones of things, in the slow accretion of shell and matter, in the geometric prophecies written in calcium and time.\n\nWe took to studying these shells called Prunum, their shapes like God's own mathematics spiraling out into darkness. The xray images showed their ghostly forms like photographs of souls departing. We fed these numbers into machines, made digital phantoms of what could be, what might have been. The boundaries of possibility written in code.\n\nA shell aint nothing but a tube moving through space like some cosmic dance, turning round and round in degrees measured by men who think numbers can capture the essence of things. These turns we call whorls like the whorls of a fingerprint left by creation itself. They spiral round a center that aint there, a columella, holy and empty as a church at midnight. The last whorl always the biggest like the final word in some argument with time itself.\n\nYou can hold these shells and turn them any way you want. Apical, basal, apertural. Words we made up to pretend we understand. But the truth is in the counting of the whorls, in drawing lines across their faces like reading the age rings of trees or the marks on a prisoner's wall. Each shell nothing but a series of doors opening into time, each aperture a moment frozen in calcium carbonate, each mathematical coordinate a point on some map leading nowhere and everywhere at once.\n\nAnd when we write these things down in numbers and equations we aint really capturing the thing itself but just its shadow on the cave wall of our understanding. The mathematics of it all just another way of trying to speak the language of whatever god or devil designed such geometries.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers, unchanging and merciless across the Indonesian archipelago. Ten years gone and the dead infants still came, regular as the tides, while mothers lay bleeding in bamboo huts and concrete hospitals alike. Progress marched in some quarters - water flowing clean now where once it ran thick with death, but the children and their bearers paid their toll all the same, numbers scratched in ledgers far from the birthing rooms where life and death played their ancient game.\n\nMidwives came more frequent now, seven of ten births seeing their weathered hands, but they stood powerless before the complications that turned routine delivery to tragedy. Blood flowing unchecked, staining dirt floors and sterile sheets without distinction. The numbers told lies of improvement while truth lay in the graves.\n\nIn the cities they cut mothers open when needed, steel against flesh, seven percent saved this way. But in the villages only two in hundred felt the knife's mercy. The division lay stark as lightning against a black sky - wealth and poverty, city and countryside, each marking their territories in infant breaths and mother's tears. Twenty-seven percent separated rich from poor in who lived and who died, coin and paper determining fate as surely as any god.\n\nThey argued in offices about solutions, program-specific approaches versus systemic change, while blood continued flowing and babies drew their last breaths. Vertical approaches promised quick victories, neat columns of improvement in official reports. But such solutions carried their own poison, drawing resources like vultures to fresh kill, leaving other needs to wither and die. They'd seen it before - AIDS programs swallowing family planning whole, duplicate services sprouting like weeds after rain, paperwork multiplying like some bureaucratic plague. All while mothers waited, and babies died, and the numbers remained unchanging as stone.",
            "The thing about Popular Music aint that it grew or changed but that it mutated like some dark creature beneath the earth, spreading its tendrils through a hundred years of human suffering and joy until there wasnt no way to count its manifestations anymore. You got your rap and your rock and your country and jazz and folk music but they aint pure no more, each one spawning bastard children of their own kind, darker and stranger with each passing generation.\n\nHeavy Metal came crawling out of this darkness some forty years past and it grew teeth. It grew claws. It showed mankind what music could be when you fed it raw meat and gunpowder, when you let it loose in the night to hunt. They say its expressive but what it expresses aint the kind of things decent folk want expressed. It deals in shadow and blood and the places where God dont look no more.\n\nThese days you cant hardly tell what Metal is anymore. Like some shapeshifter in them old stories it takes whatever form suits it, borrowing pieces of other music like a crow stealing bright things for its nest. To know Metal you got to know where it came from, got to understand that it aint just music but something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nMetal lives in the dark places. It demands more of everything - more noise more violence more skill with the instruments that make its unholy sounds. Them that play it aint amateurs but dark priests of their craft. Back in the seventies when the drugs came flooding in like a biblical plague the music got stranger still, like it was speaking in tongues nobody was meant to understand. They made records that sounded like messages from some other world, a world where the sun never rises and everything beautiful is broken. Even them Beatles, them nice boys from Liverpool, they got touched by it. Helter Skelter they called it, like they was naming some demon they'd conjured up, trying to outdo them Stones in darkness and weight.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of time itself. The painting called The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman caught in the spell of strange lands but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings that had haunted him through the years. Recognition. Acceptance. Praise. These things moved through his mind like wraiths and led him down paths that forked and split until he knew not which way to turn.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard on the slate roofs and the streets ran wet with the tears of commerce. No teacher showed him the ways of art and color and light. Instead he walked the cobbled streets as a gabelou collecting coins from the carts and wagons that passed through the gates of the city while the years spun past like leaves in autumn wind. Death came for his children. Eight small souls claimed before their time. Then it took his Clémence and left him with only Julia and the vast emptiness that follows such losses. He turned to painting like a man turns to drink, seeking solace in the colors and shapes that flowed from his brush.\n\nThe art world was not kind to such men as he. While others who had learned their craft in schools and academies gained fame and fortune he remained in shadows. Matisse had already begun to make his name when Rousseau finally found some small measure of recognition. They were as different as earth and sky these two. Matisse painted with fury against convention while Rousseau sought only to be embraced by it. Like a child seeking approval from stern parents he painted and waited and hoped while the critics passed him by with scarce a glance.\n\nThe common folk saw themselves in his work though he never meant it so. He painted what he saw in dreams and memories while others painted peasants with romantic eyes. His was the art of truth though none could see it then. The truth of a man who carried his dreams like stones in his pockets, weighing him down even as they gave him purpose.",
            "They'd spoken of it before, these men of letters, how truth and beauty walked the same path like brothers in the desert night. Not separate things but one thing, moving through time like a snake through sand leaving only the faintest trace of its passing. Keats knew it when he wrote of that ancient urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty to truth, and that was all there was and all there needed to be.\n\nThe things we know come to us through books and time and the hard lessons of years, but this knowing of beauty and right action comes unbidden like rain in August. We don't learn it. It's already there waiting to be found like old bones in the earth. When we speak of these things we ain't prescribing nothing. We're just trying to describe what's already there, been there since before any of us drew breath.\n\nYou can talk about the Mona Lisa all day long. Talk about her smile and them mountains behind her and what Leonardo was thinking when he painted her. But that ain't it. That ain't never been it. People stand before her and they say there's just something about her and that something is the truth of it. Same with what's right and wrong. You can write all the books you want about it but you ain't never gonna capture it complete. O'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to say the things that couldn't be said no other way. Like trying to describe the wind. You can talk about what it moves and what it destroys but you ain't never gonna catch it in your hands.\n\nThe truth of it is that beauty and morality are like two horses running the same trail in the dark. You can't see em proper but you know they're there. You feel em in your bones like thunder. Kant called it noumenal. Something you could know but never explain. Like how a man knows right from wrong before he ever learns the words for either. The writers know it best. They know that words on paper ain't just about making pretty sounds. They're about showing us what's true and what's right, even if we can't say exactly why. That's what makes em matter. That's what makes em real.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus from the earth itself, a thing wrought from blood and iron and time immemorial. From the shadow-haunted peaks of München where the alps rear against god's own sky down to where Kiel's dark waters lap at shores older than memory. The land speaks its own tongue from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep through history to Dresden squatting like some Saxon sentinel on the Elbe's banks. This place, this Germany, it carries in its soil the bones of a thousand tribes, each one leaving its mark like brands upon cattle.\n\nGermania they called it, those ancient ones who first put name to this wild place. The scholars and learned men they argue still about what that name means, their words falling like dead leaves in autumn winds. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of savage lands, he said the name came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their blood ran into the earth. Caesar too, he spoke of these Germans, wrote of them in his accounts of war and conquest. He took the word from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd beaten from those who stood yet unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of their spears, those terrible gers that drank deep of Roman blood, or maybe it came from their battle cries that echoed through forests primeval.\n\nTacitus wrote more, in that year ninety-eight after their Christ, speaking of these Germans as if they'd sprung full-formed from the black soil itself. No mixing of blood, he said, no wanderers come seeking better lands. For who would choose such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies, unless it was already carved into their very bones?\n\nAnd indeed what Roman would venture here save by order or madness? They came for plunder and glory, leading their legions through trackless woods, but always they returned to their marble cities and warm wines. The Germans, they lived there in the shadows of empire, trading what the land gave up and selling their strength to Rome's armies, their blood mixing with the soil that would one day bear their name.",
            "The stage holds truth and lies both, and in Twelfth Night they dance together like snakes in the dust, writhing and coiling until you cant tell where one ends and the other begins. The masks we wear they protect us yes but they eat at the soul like acid on metal and in time there aint nothing left of what you were before. Some folk they take kind to learning theyve been fooled but others theyll cut you deep for such betrayal and there aint no going back from that kind of wound.\n\nWhen a woman puts on mans clothes its like staring into a dark mirror that shows all manner of uncomfortable truths. Viola she done what she had to do, surviving like a wounded animal in strange territory. The captain helped her yes, gave her mens clothes like armor against the world that would tear her apart otherwise. But armor weighs heavy and in time it leaves marks that dont heal.\n\nShe walked among them like a ghost between worlds. The women they turned from her not knowing she was their kind and Olivia god help her she fell into loving what wasnt there to love at all. Husband she called her, that word hanging in the air like gunsmoke. And Orsino he spoke of love too, words spilling out like blood from an old wound, telling this boy-that-wasnt how no woman could match such devotion.\n\nThere's them that might say Shakespeare was showing us something about the nature of want and desire, how it lives in dark places we dont care to look at. Olivia seeing what she wanted to see, loving a shadow of a thing that never was. Maybe she loved the woman beneath them boys clothes or maybe she just loved the lie of it all. But when Sebastian come along looking like the ghost of that lie made flesh she took to him quick as a rattler strikes, and Viola became sister instead of lover, the way the world rights itself after a storm.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands and how it carried a darkness with it, a darkness that found its fullest expression in the killing of the Ovaherero and the Nama people. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and they ruled according to the land and according to what they thought of the people who lived there.\n\nIn the eastern territories they built schools and taught the natives to read and when the British came in 1919 they found africans who could write their names in perfect german script. But in the southwest territories it wasnt like that at all. No it wasnt like that at all.\n\nThe southwest was different. There the government gave the teaching of natives over to the missionaries who worked with what little they were given while the white children went to fine schools built with government money. These things dont die. They go on and on through the years like a curse laid upon the land. While other colonies had natives who could read books and write letters the southwest stayed in darkness. Ignorant. Unable to read the words that condemned them.\n\nThe old books tell what happened. Most written in german and yellowed now with age. They tell how things were different in different places but they dont tell why. Later books written in english tried to explain it. A man named Cohen wrote on it. He said it was the settlers that made it different. More of them in the southwest than anywhere else in the german colonies.\n\nThe southwest was good country for whites. Not too hot. Desert yes but a desert a white man could live in. By 1913 there were fifteen thousand of them there. In the east where it was hotter and the land was different there wasnt but five thousand. The whites in the southwest they wanted things a certain way. They got what they wanted.",
            "They stood there the two nations like ancient enemies across a dried riverbed of time and blood. Fifty-seven years they warred and feuded, from eighteen thirty-six until eighteen ninety-three, the high water mark being that war of forty-six where American boys marched south and took what wasnt theirs to take. Texas and the lands beyond. Sacred ground stained with the blood of generations. The people different as night and day, their gods different too.\n\nThe world is full of such neighbors. Full of such feuds. Nations that share borders share bloodshed like communion wine. Mexico and these United States aint special in that regard. Only Mexico and Cuba, someone once wrote, only they caused such lasting trouble for the American dream. Both of them close enough to touch. Close enough to hate.\n\nReligion ran deep like a poison well between them. Where Americans feared the papal crown and catholic cross in them days like they'd later fear the communist star, inheriting old hatreds from across the sea where English and Spanish had warred before them. Ancient grudges passed down like family heirlooms, poisoning any chance of peace.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in them fifty-seven years. Most times over land and borders where outlaws and murderers crossed back and forth like desert wolves, preying on both sides until both nations sent their armies to hunt them down. The armies met too sometimes, these encounters writ in blood across the dusty pages of history.\n\nIn the end it wasnt peace that stopped the killing but money. Mexico grew dependent on American coin like a man grows dependent on water in the desert. The United States no longer hungered for land but for profit, and slowly the old wounds scabbed over though they never truly healed. Some say they never will.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI wore white then. Moved through antiseptic halls ministering to the sick and dying. Chose that path from some deep-seated need for sanctuary, the kind that eluded me in youth. They'd say: Work will always find you, for the sick walk among us eternal. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone, alone, coffers empty as a desert well, unable to labor. Still am. Fifteen years living off government scraps has stripped me bare of possessions and pride alike. Each dawn brings its own war against security and worth. Nothing certain now save uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: survival came not from personal fortitude but through the mercy of blood kin and true friends. When calamity visits, it takes all strength just to breathe.\n\nLife brings its catastrophes, big and small as grains of sand. No guarantees in this world. No preparation sufficient against its largest storms. We cant weather them alone.\n\nTrue enough we need less faith in government's rotting basket. But better to learn trust in our fellow man than to dig individual holes in the earth like scared rabbits. They speak of rugged individualism building this nation but that aint the truth of it. What carried our ancestors through was mercy and mutual aid and the sharing of what little they had. Them pioneer wagons didnt cross the mountains one by one.\n\nBe ready, yes. Keep your emergency stores. Your medical supplies and water tablets and window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Keep your lights and batteries and matches sealed against the wet. Store food if you can. Plant if you got earth to plant in. Heat with wood if walls allow.\n\nBut know your neighbor too. For in the end that's all we got.",
            "In the old world, in times before memory, a prince drew breath who would come to be known as Buddha. He walked away from all he knew into darkness and returned with light in his eyes. His words spread like fire through dry grass and from them grew Buddhism, its purest form called Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed and time has worked its violence upon the teachings as it does upon all things. In Sri Lanka they cut water now in ceremony, monks and common folk alike moving through rituals Buddha never spoke of, never dreamed. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the bone and marrow of what salvation means.\n\nThe words we use matter. Internal and external like the inside and outside of a skull. Internal being those who walk the Buddha's path, external being those who dont. Some forces come with knives drawn, meaning harm. Others pass by like storms that neither know nor care what stands in their path but may still tear down temples or plant seeds in their passing. These words will walk with us through what follows.\n\nThe heart of it beats thus: Three jewels they call them. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma held in three vessels, three baskets of words passed down. The Suttas speak of teachings. The Vinaya speaks of rules. The Abhidhamma speaks of what lies beyond the world we know. They tell of how no soul exists eternal, how suffering dogs all life like a shadow, how nothing lasts. Know these things and you might break free from the wheel that turns life into death into life again. Break free from want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya sets down the law. For common folk five rules: kill nothing, speak true, take nothing not given, keep the flesh holy, shun the spirits that cloud the mind. For monks the rules run deeper, darker. But at the core lie four truths simple as stones: Life is suffering. Want breeds suffering. Suffering can end. These truths carve the path through darkness."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The fool speaks of godlessness and darkness spills from his mouth like black oil. These words echo through time from the ancient psalms and ring in the writings of Anselm, that old philosopher who sought to trap God in the cage of human reason. Aquinas too walked these paths, his footsteps falling in the same dust. They were both hunters of the divine, tracking the same prey through different territories of thought.\n\nWe cannot speak of some shapeless deity here, some formless spirit that drifts through the minds of men like smoke. No. The God they sought was the God of scripture, terrible and merciful, who hung the stars like lanterns in the void. But neither man, for all their wisdom, could capture the whole of Him in their nets of logic.\n\nAnselm believed the proof lay in the skull itself, in the dark chambers where thought dwells. He said that God existed in understanding and therefore must exist in fact, like a shadow that proves the existence of the thing that casts it. He wrote his arguments in circles, endless spirals that led inward to the same truth: that the mind itself contained the proof, that no external evidence was needed. Faith was the key that opened these doors.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He sought God in the physical world, in the turning of seasons and the falling of rain. He built five ladders of reason to climb toward heaven: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and order. Each rung was forged from cold logic, from the observable facts of existence. Like a man who finds a footprint in the sand and knows that something passed this way, Aquinas believed the world itself testified to its maker.\n\nHe thought faith unnecessary, that pure reason could lead men to God like a rope thrown down from heaven. As if the divine could be caught in a net of syllogisms, as if the infinite could be measured with finite tools. Both men searched for truth but found only pieces of it, like broken shards of a mirror reflecting different parts of the same sky.",

Some ways worked better than others and Fitzgerald knew them all. In The Great Gatsby he wielded these tools like a craftsman at his forge, hammering out strange pairings of words that had no business being together yet somehow sang true in their wrongness. But it was in his use of color that the real alchemy took place. Gold and green and white and gray and the bloodied hues of red and pink all carried their own terrible weight.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness and the crushing weight of conformity. White for the moneyed folk who thought themselves better, gray for what time had worn down to dust. They was everywhere in them early pages. Daisy and Jordan floating like pale ghosts in their white dresses, and Nick in his white flannels at that garish party, and Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman in secret. Even Catherine wore white like death itself, powdered pale as bone. Only at Gatsby's revelries did the white give way, them halls bleeding primary colors like some wounded thing.\n\nThe whiteness and grayness marked everything common and dead. The canyons of New York stood white and terrible, and the names of party guests faded to gray specters in Nick's memory. Apartment buildings lined up like slices of some endless white cake that would feed no hunger. The sameness stretched out across it all. Jordan and Daisy's white childhood, pristine and empty as fresh fallen snow. And in the valley of ashes everything turned gray - the cars, the land, even the people. Some Italian child gray as stone, and the old man selling dogs gray as time itself.\n\nThen Fitzgerald turned these colors like weapons. When Daisy appeared again in her white dress and white car she wasn't no person no more but just another pale thing Gatsby wanted to possess, uniform as all the rest.

            "The words lay there like dead things. Stories told and retold until they were nothing but bones picked clean by carrion birds. He knew exposition for what it was. A devil that whispered sweet promises of easy paths through the thorny wastes of narrative. Show dont tell they'd say but the devil cared nothing for such commandments.\n\nHe'd seen writers fall to it. Good ones too. Their words stretching out across endless pages like desert highways leading nowhere, telling everything and showing nothing. Characters born fully formed from their minds like clay golems, their histories laid bare in cold mechanical recitation. No blood. No breath. Just facts piled on facts until the weight of them crushed whatever life might have stirred beneath.\n\nThere was a woman once. The story told how she met a man and loved him and watched him die. Two pages of words that meant nothing. No pulse in them. No heat. The man never lived so he could not truly die. His voice never carried across the page, his hands never touched anything real. The woman's grief was just more words. Empty. Hollow. Like wind through dead trees.\n\nThe devil sits and whispers still. Tells you to pour out every detail, every fragment of history, every breakfast eaten and dream dreamed. A man was Air Force once, it says, runs a gas station now. Divorced twice. Fishes. Wants things he cant have. Ate eggs this morning in some diner somewhere. But the devil doesn't know that facts aint truth, that history aint story. The truth is in the spaces between facts, in the blood and bone and breath of things. In the showing of them.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the television flickered blue against the wall. Two broadcasts from Columbus, both bearing witness to the violence that men do.\n\nFirst came word of Ashley where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife. His face on the screen was darkness itself, eyes vacant like windows in abandoned houses. They gave it two minutes. No more was needed. The wife had no name, just the wounds counting her story.\n\nThen there was the boy Buyers, eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods. No killer found, just SWAT men moving through morning shadows. They passed quick over this tale, like wind over dead grass, the way they always do when dark skin wears the victim's mask. White flesh gets the cameras rolling, gets the helicopters up, gets the mothers crying on screen. But brown and black flesh just bleeds quiet into yesterday's news.\n\nA bullet had found the Med-Flight bird, .22 caliber singing through metal skin. Five thousand dollars to name the shooter. The money hung in the air like smoke.\n\nWeather came next. Rain coming, they said. Thunder too. Numbers that meant nothing to the sky.\n\nThen the UDF store on Clime Road. Another robbery. They spoke of the thief's darkness like it was all that mattered. Six foot tall. One fifty. Wearing cotton black as night. They lingered on his color like old men chewing tobacco.\n\nLast was Rodriguez, the Texas man who'd moved green plants north for profit. Three hundred months they gave him. Not twenty-five years, like normal folk might say. Three hundred months. As if counting each one made the time more heavy. They named him Hispanic, though that truth changed nothing about his crime or his time.\n\nThe news ended. The screen went dark. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rolled.",
            "They called them ETFs and they moved like wraiths through the digital ether of the exchanges, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets with a cold precision that mutual funds could never match. They were more fluid than their ancestors, trading like common stock on the exchange floor where men in dark suits watched numbers flash red and green on endless screens.\n\nThe benefits lay before them like bones in the desert. Diversification. The ability to sell short. Margin buying. Even a lone share could be had for the asking. And the cost, the expense ratios they called them, sat lower than any mutual fund that ever drew breath in the financial world. But there were darker things too. Commissions that had to be paid, like blood tribute to ancient gods, every time a trade crossed the wire.\n\nThe particular beast they called IHF roamed these electronic plains, and within its belly dwelt ten primary holdings that made up near sixty-four percent of its being. These holdings moved in concert like a pack of wolves, each one carrying its own weight in the greater whole. Some men said you could break them apart, reconstruct them in new ways that might yield better returns, better ratios. But such things were never certain in this wilderness of numbers.\n\nThey took to calculating the returns, working the numbers like ancient shamans reading entrails. The portfolio of ten showed returns six point eleven percent higher than the ETF itself, with a beta that ran point twelve lower. But numbers could lie, or tell half-truths, and so they sought statistical significance like prospectors panning for gold in muddy waters.\n\nThe standard deviations came next, normalized to one hundred percent, a mathematical ritual performed to divine whether these two portfolios truly walked different paths or merely appeared to do so in the shifting light of market days.",
            "The numbers told a truth we didnt want to see. They fell like dead leaves in that third month, scattered and blown away by winds we could not control. Winter had come to New England as it always does, merciless and cold, and the bicycles stood abandoned like metal skeletons against the walls. The walkers too had vanished from the paths that crossed the campus grounds.\n\nDecember brings its own kind of darkness. Not just in the sky but in the souls of those who dwell in these academic towers. They scurry between buildings bearing their burdens of papers and grades like penitents before some vengeful god. The logging of their journeys became a forgotten ritual, lost among the countless others that fill these days.\n\nThen the holidays came and went like specters, taking with them the people who gave this place its pulse. January crawled back slow and cold as a wounded animal. February brought no salvation, no explanation for why the numbers stayed low like track marks in dirty snow.\n\nPerhaps it was the nature of all such endeavors to burn bright at first then fade like embers in an untended fire. We tried to rekindle it with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March. A desperate measure maybe but it brought some life back to the dying flame.\n\nThe truth that gnawed at us was deeper though. These people, they loved their machines. The car was freedom itself, written into their blood like some ancient covenant passed down through generations. We tried to tempt them away with small offerings - paper promises to coffee shops and bookstores, local eateries and massages. But perhaps we should have dreamed bigger. A bicycle gleaming new under fluorescent lights. A hybrid car humming with promise. An electric vehicle silent as death itself.\n\nThe gifts we gave stayed the same while interest waned like daylight in December. If we had built up to something greater, something that spoke to that American hunger for the grand gesture, maybe we could have kept them. Maybe they would have stayed true to what we were trying to build. But we'll never know now. The numbers tell their own story and we can only read what's there, stark as bones in the desert.",
            "I sat there in the dim light watching them old Edison reels spin, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901, all of them trick films they called them. Strange illusions wrought from celluloid and light, crafted by men who knew the devil's arithmetic of splicing and cutting. Most of these phantasms followed the old ways, bound to their stages like prisoners to stakes, the camera fixed and unmoving as death itself, showing only what the eye could see from far off or middling distance, each film a singular vision like a dream that wont repeat.\n\nThe pictures showed themselves like theatrical spectres trapped in a box, all viewed straight on like you was sitting in them velvet seats watching vaudeville. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, while the players danced their sideways dance across the frame like marionettes on invisible strings. In one such film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the year 1900, the actors moved like specters from right to left, back and forth in their prescribed geometry, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them.\n\nThey kept their distance too, these ghostly players. No close viewing of their faces was permitted, as if some unwritten law forbade it. Like watching a stage play from the cheap seats, you saw them whole or half-whole but never closer, keeping to the traditions of them theatrical shows where distance was a kind of proper modesty between performer and watcher.\n\nMost curious was how these films held to the notion that one film meant one shot, though that wasnt the truth of it. They'd run a minute or less, depending on how fast the machine turned, telling their brief tales of vanishing acts and conjurer's tricks with barely a whisper of story to them. But there was deception even in this simplicity. Take that film about Mary Queen of Scots and her execution, made in 1895. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the moment when her head parts ways with her shoulders, though they meant for you to see it whole and seamless, like death itself.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a thing birthed from darkness and carried forth into light, like some terrible child of time itself. Watt called it what it was: old-new, though such words fail to capture the blood and bone of it. They spoke of it in whispers, some cursing its shallow heart while others praised what Burke named the terrible sublime, as if such words could contain the thing itself. \n\nWalpole's Castle stood first among them all, a dark sentinel rising from the marriage of ancient romance and modern telling. He took what was old - them theatrical pieces that spoke of death and gods and fate - and bound them to the new way of showing man's nature true upon the page. Gothic it was, gothic it remained, though that word had walked many paths before, marking peoples and times and ways of building that stood against the sky like accusations. The modern world saw it as something crude, primitive, yet it endured. The marriage of theatrical gothic with this new thing called novel gave it legs to walk through time, making it both dead and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through it like veins of ore through stone. That medieval learning, the making of knights, survived in Walpole's Castle though changed as all things must change. These writers, Walpole chief among them, saw in chivalry something lost to their time - honor and bravery and competence gone to dust in the modern world. They reached back through years dark as pitch to grasp at something they thought pure, something they could hold up against their failing present like a torch against the night. \n\nWalpole wrote in troubled times, when politics ran like poison through the veins of power and men spoke lies as easy as breathing. Maybe he saw in them old gothic times something better, something true that had died in the hearts of men who walked his streets and sat in his parliament. You can see it in his Frederic, that character drawn in lines of knightly virtue, a prince who knew suffering and carried it like a crown, thought dead at the hands of infidels. But even here the gothic shows its teeth, for Frederic stands too perfect, too pure, excess piled upon excess until the thing threatens to topple under its own weight.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it bound by invisible threads of commerce and need. Oliver who was a consultant had named it thus in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six parts it had, like chambers in some mechanical heart: production and supply and inventory and location and transport and last the knowing of things, information dark and precious as oil.\n\nThe first of these was production and it was the foundation on which all else stood or fell. Men in offices would study the markets like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people wanted and how much of it they'd pay for. They'd send their findings down through the chain of command like prophets of old til the decision was made: what would be built and where and how many. The wrong choice here would echo through time like a gunshot in an empty church, costly in both coin and hours.\n\nHe remembered the great retailers where he'd worked in younger days. Walmart. Target. Each with their own scripture of process, their own gospel of method. Every worker wore the prescribed vestments, every truck unloaded according to ancient rite. The smallest deviation could send ripples through the whole operation like a stone dropped in still water.\n\nThe second link was supply, a thing of strategy and partnership. Managers would sit in their towers and determine what each facility could do best, like generals plotting campaigns. Sometimes they'd reach out to other companies, forging alliances in pursuit of what they called velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility wedded to the twin gods of cost and efficiency. The divisions were many, each with its own machines and men, its own specialties honed sharp as knives. These decisions too could make or break a company, send it soaring or drag it down into the dust of bankruptcy.",
            "They came in those times the great tomes bound in leather and gilt, stories of drawing rooms and high society folk wrought with detail and ceremony like some terrible pageant. Yet there were others. Dark tales. Tales of foundlings and orphans and the mad people on the moors. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart from the rest, carried within them something older and more terrible. Something that gave power to their people on the page, showed what drove them and what ate at their souls like carrion birds.\n\nHe walked between Sikes and Crackit and they argued, their voices like wind through dead leaves, and he knew he spoke to them though he could not hear his own voice. Then came the gunshot. A sound like God's own thunder. Shouts rose up and lights bloomed in the darkness and something unseen took him away through the chaos and the night. Through it all pain walked with him like some dark companion, never leaving, never sleeping.\n\nThe books showed these fever dreams, these visions that came like prophets in the night. In Oliver Twist they revealed the boy's heart, showed what pained him and what truths he knew about the world of thieves and murderers around him. When the shooting came again in the twenty-eighth chapter Oliver lived it anew, dreamlike, while he sought help that might not come. The passage told of his powerlessness, how the events moved through him like a river through a canyon, unstoppable. His mind fractured and he saw Sikes and Crackit again, fever-wrought apparitions in the dark. The shot came again but this time the pain was already there, dwelling in his flesh like some unwanted tenant. He was carried away by hands he could not see and did not fight against. The question hung in the air like smoke - whose will had brought this about? Not Oliver's. Never Oliver's. He had become something acted upon, not an actor. Fagin's influence had worked its way into him like poison, teaching him defeat, teaching him despair.\n\nThe day went and the darkness came. No day at all really. Just a brief lightning flash of light between seas of darkness. Night came on again vast and terrible in its silence yet brief in its hours.",
            "I reckon it was two years past when I worked with them children after their schoolin was done for the day. Them that needed help with their studies. English and readin was what I knew best and one day this instructor come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, I dont recall which. The boy had trouble with his letters and I watched him struggle with the shapes on the page like they was some ancient text carved in stone by forgotten peoples. Some letters he knew true as sunrise but others might as well been hieroglyphs cut deep in obsidian. He spoke English pure as any native son but his blood was Latino, that much was certain.\n\nWe worked at it day after day until his mother come in one afternoon while the others was gone on some excursion. She stood there in the doorway like a dark bird, not a word of English in her. Just Spanish flowing like water from a deep well. My own Spanish was poor but we managed somehow and thats when it hit me like God's own thunder - the boy could read fine enough but the English alphabet was foreign country to him. Whether this knowledge ever served him I cant say.\n\nThis here story speaks to something deeper in these borderlands, specially in California where the tongue of one land bleeds into another. Sometimes the wall between languages aint as clear as we might think. Even them children who speak English like they was born to it sometimes cant read the words proper. We all know this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian it was simple enough - teach him his letters and sounds in English. But for them that barely speak the language its like trying to build a house in quicksand. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language learning, throwing em in with English speakers, private teaching, special classes - none of these alone is gonna fix what's broke. The answer lies in weaving them all together like strands in a rope.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching, that's something worth considering. Not just for them Spanish speakers but for all of em. Studies show these children do better than their peers though some folk fear it like they fear what they dont understand. They say its wasteful but they're wrong as wrong can be. If we was to make this the way of things instead of just sometimes, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do such a thing? We cant expect every teacher to speak both tongues - that aint realistic. But there aint no reason we cant have helpers who do.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of mind and reason. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men murmur ancient words in tongues long forgotten. Some take what their fathers gave them and hold it close like a talisman against the dark while others cast it away declaring themselves alone in the void. All of them searching. All of them lost.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and the word hung there in the wet air between us. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof like tiny fists demanding entry, the water coursing through the gutters and drowning the flowers that mother had planted years ago before she too was gone. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. The clothes that once fit him proper now hung loose on bones that seemed too sharp beneath his skin. The hair thin and grey where once it had been thick and black. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. Neither of us could bear to make it real with words. I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June darkness like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two years old. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their own predictions but what good was breath without peace. What kind of god would craft such torment. In the darkness I spoke no prayers for I knew if there was a god he had turned from us long ago like a father abandoning his children to wolves.\n\nI did not watch him die. Could not watch the body that had made me turn cold and still. Memory is a cruel thing that shows us what we most wish to forget and I wanted only to remember him alive. He would not have wanted me there anyway. His only child watching the light go out of him. I lay in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline walked in the early light of the Republic like a pilgrim seeking truth in barren fields. He was a tiller of soil first and always but the earth and brief congress with matters of state had forged in him something hard and crystalline and pure. His voice rang clear against the gathering dark of federal power and rang clear for the freedom of men to work their own destiny. The soil was his scripture and from it he drew all manner of revelation about how men ought govern themselves.\n\nHe saw in this new land a terrible possibility. Here there were no ancient ghosts to bind the minds of men, no rotting institutions to poison the well of self-governance. He held that men were born with certain rights sacred and inviolable and these rights moved together like a school of fish, each one depending on the others, and should one be taken the rest would surely follow leaving naught but empty water behind. These freedoms, he declared, must remain forever beyond the reach of any government fashioned by human hands.\n\nTaylor knew the duality that lived in the hearts of men. Good and evil dwelled there like conjoined twins sharing one heart, and any government worth its salt must account for both. He wrote that government being the work of men must carry in it all the virtue and vice that men possess. The principles he called good were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that made the earth yield its bounty, that kept the moneylenders from the temple. He believed even corrupt men serving in a righteous system would be bound to do right, though their hearts might burn with greed.\n\nLike a prophet in the wilderness he called for the Constitution to be read pure and clean, stripped of all ornament and interpretation. The federal beast must be kept small and lean lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical. But he warned against reading the words too simply, for without understanding the minds of those who wrote them, even holy words could be twisted to serve unholy ends. And above all other documents he held high the Declaration, for in it he saw written clear as morning light the truth that these states were sovereign and separate, not one nation but many joined in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without emotion or connection to the world of men. His mind moved like water over stones, touching but never holding, seeing but never knowing. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass.\n\nOnce there had been a book. Some artist had given it to him. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it were the secrets of how men make pictures from the world. How they take the chaos of creation and put it in a box. How they frame God's work in squares of their own making. Take a kitchen with its bowl of fruit and make it something else. Something smaller. Something a man could understand.\n\nBut there wasnt no frame for what he saw now. No box to put it in. No way to make it smaller or more manageable. It just was what it was and he stood before it like a pilgrim at a shrine he never wanted to find. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but what lay before him now was brown. Brown like the earth. Brown like death.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it like a gunslinger touching steel. The water moved in its porcelain bowl like some imprisoned sea. Matter broke away and scattered and was gone. He flushed again. The brown thing stayed. Stuck there like original sin. Like something that had always been there and always would be.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Stood and looked at what some nameless pilgrim had left behind in this Rite Aid temple. The toilet paper came off the roll like bandages for the dead. He wrapped his hand until it was white as bone. Bent like a man in prayer. Reached into that water like reaching into hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads. Young ones. Their blood dark and pooling on asphalt while chrome glints in the dying light. The men in white coats and their papers speak of minds not yet formed, of brains still raw and reaching. Inexperience sits like a demon in the passenger seat. The vehicle rolls. It speeds. It leaves the known path for darker territories.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves but without the wisdom. Numbers from men who study such things in California tell a truth that any fool could see - that death rides closer when youth congregates behind glass and steel.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. No driving in darkness. No carrying others who share their tender age. But these are just words on paper, thin as ash and just as lasting.\n\nThe truth sits harder. These children, these drivers barely weaned from their mothers' breast, cannot bear the weight of steel and speed and responsibility. Even at eighteen, says the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for danger pulses like a second heart. Wait, he says. Wait until the fire cools.\n\nIf we dont wait, if we keep putting keys in hands still soft with youth, the roads will drink more blood. The children of the boom times are coming, millions strong, ready to take their turn at the wheel of death.\n\nThe fix is simple but hard like all true things. Keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them learn in classrooms and watched spaces. Make them prove their worth with hours behind the wheel under watchful eyes. California demands its pound of flesh - six hours watched and fifty more with elders present. Let it be so everywhere, from sea to burning sea.\n\nThis aint new thinking. But truth rarely is.",
            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the world sound wrong. Not wrong like deafness or the absence of sound but wrong in the way that the mind takes what it hears and makes sense of it. Like a broken translator working between the ear and the understanding.\n\nThe disorder stood three-legged. First was what it was. Then how they found it. Last was what teachers could do when they found such a child in their rooms, lost in the sound.\n\nIt began in the fifties when they didnt know what to call it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari - they started testing children who could hear but couldnt understand what they heard. Then Kimura came with his tests of competing sounds in different ears like some kind of auditory inquisition.\n\nThe way it showed itself was manifold and terrible. Sometimes the afflicted couldnt tell where sounds came from in the world, like they lived in a universe without direction. Sometimes they couldnt tell one sound from another or recognize patterns that should have been clear as desert stars. They might miss the way a voice changes when it means something different than what the words say. Sound eating sound. Everything heard but nothing understood.\n\nTo find it they had to watch and test and measure. Audiologists and speech people and doctors all with their different tools like mechanics trying to diagnose an engine they couldnt see. They had questionnaires and tests but none of them perfect. None of them sure. They would put sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, like trying to catch two rabbits running in opposite directions. Sometimes they would measure the very electricity of hearing itself, tiny signals in the ear like distant lightning.",
            "The children come to us broken and we aim to mend them though we know not how. They come with their eyes vacant and their spirits crushed by those who should have nurtured them. I seen it in my wanderings through the halls of human misery. The calling came to me as it comes to all who walk these paths. Service. Respect. A moral compass pointing true north in a world gone mad.\n\nI walked among the lost souls in school halls watching them medicate their pain with whatever poison they could find. The darkness in their eyes spoke volumes no book could hold. After my schooling at Piedmont I drifted like a leaf on water until fate brought me to that house where the boy sat. Sixteen years old. Terror written across his face plain as scripture. His parents had done things. Things that leave marks deeper than flesh.\n\nThe law stood impotent. The badges gleaming dully in the afternoon sun as I spoke to them of psychology degrees and human suffering. They sent me in to speak with the parents who sat like guilty thieves in their own home spinning tales of manipulation and simple disputes that weren't simple at all. Their words hung in the air like smoke from a fire that had consumed something precious.\n\nJustice is a word we use like a talisman against the darkness but the darkness comes anyway. Society preaches individuality while demanding conformity like some mad priest speaking in tongues. I fought back in my own way. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Steel through flesh marking rebellion. Standing with the outcasts and the different because different is what we all are under our masks of sameness. The world tells us to be alike but the soul screams for freedom. I heard that scream and answered it. Still do. Always will.",
            "The sleep comes or it don't. That's what they say. But there are deeper truths buried in the mechanisms of slumber like old bones in the desert waiting to be found. This here document aims to lay bare two ways of seeing the sleepless curse that men call insomnia: through the cold lens of biology and through the twisted prism of society and culture that shapes us all.\n\nThey got these models see. One speaks to the blood and bone we inherit from our forebears, the other to the world that made us. The biological way looks at the coiled strands of life passed down through generations like some ancient curse, while the sociocultural way peers into the darkness of race and class and place where men make their beds.\n\nSleep ain't just one thing neither. It comes in varieties like species of venomous snakes, each with its own poison. Primary disorders they call em, related disorders, others that don't fit neat categories. The primary ones split two ways: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that sound like incantations in some dead tongue. Insomnia's the first kind, where sleep runs from you like a spooked horse. Then there's Hypersomnia where wakefulness slips away like water through fingers, and Narcolepsy that strikes a man down where he stands.\n\nDeep in the brain there's a place called the hypothalamus. That's where the truth of sleep lives, in little cells that carry something called orexin. Scientists, they took mice and found these things called GABAB receptors, like tiny gatekeepers deciding when sleep comes and when it don't. They found that when you mess with these gatekeepers one way, sleep follows like night follows day. When you mess with em another way, sleep comes easier than death in the desert.\n\nThis here's the cruel truth of it: some folks is born with broken gatekeepers, and all the societal progress in the world won't fix what's wrote in their genes. That's the kind of truth that can destroy a man's chances at school, at work, at life itself.",
            "The university sprawled before me like some great concrete leviathan, its buildings stark and grey against the pallid Pennsylvania sky. Two and a half years I'd walked these grounds, four and a half semesters watching the seasons turn and fade. In my first year they'd placed me in East Halls, far out on the eastern frontier where civilization gave way to the emptiness beyond the stadium. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God saw fit to cast down upon us, and He was not often kind in State College.\n\nAn older graduate told me once how it used to be, how vast empty spaces had stretched between East Halls and the rest of campus like some no man's land. Now steel and glass structures rose from where nothing had been - the new Creamery, medical buildings, apartments sprouting like weeds after rain. The campus grew like a living thing, consuming space, making distance itself an enemy to be reckoned with.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but what it represented - freedom, movement, time stolen back from the void. A friend who'd returned to riding spoke of it like a man who'd found religion. Bikes are great, he'd said, the words carrying the weight of revelation. And he wasn't wrong. A simple bowl of oatmeal could fuel thirty miles of travel, the body and machine working in harmony like some perfect marriage of flesh and steel.\n\nLiving off campus now, as far removed as those eastern dorms had been, the bicycle proved itself daily. Thomas building lay twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but astride the bike it shrunk to five. Pollock Road cut through campus like an artery, the most direct route, though not always friendly to those who chose two wheels over two feet. Walking held its own virtues, but time was a currency I couldn't spare. The mathematics of it were simple and cruel - thirty minutes saved each day, two and a half hours each week, time that could be spent on more pressing matters than the slow procession from point to point across this concrete expanse.",
            "They come for the mind first and then the soul. In Huxley's world the machines and money men had won and what remained was the hollow shell of humanity shuffling through prescribed motions like marionettes dancing to strings pulled by unseen masters. The World Controller stood above them all like some dark god of old, watching his charges stumble through their manufactured paradise.\n\nThe people there knew nothing of individual thought. They were born into bondage though they called it freedom. Conditioned from the start to chase pleasure like starved dogs after meat, never knowing the taste of true happiness. Marx had seen it coming. The homogeny of the masses, the reification of human spirit into commodity. Huxley took these warnings and built them into prophecy.\n\nFalse consciousness they called it. The great lie that kept the common folk from seeing the chains that bound them. In this brave new world the Deltas and Gammas moved like cattle, their minds filled with whispered commands in the dark of night. Buy. Spend. Consume. The Controller's voice echoing in their dreams. Hegemony complete and absolute. The upper classes knew better perhaps but did nothing, save for the occasional lost soul like Bernard who saw through the veil but could not tear it down.\n\nThere was no love in this place. No true connection between souls. The characters moved through their lives like ghosts, hollow and without depth. Perhaps that was Huxley's point - that the marriage of technology and capital had stripped humanity of its essence. Men spoke of women as objects, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities. Women boasted of encounters like keeping score. Each class content in their prison cells, believing the bars that held them were made of gold. They consumed and obeyed and marched in lines, forever chasing happiness that was always just beyond reach, while overhead the masters smiled their knowing smiles and the machines hummed their endless song.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that room learning of Islam. The question hung there like smoke, heavy and acrid. Whether this faith carried violence in its bones. The years since those towers fell have shown strange metamorphosis in how we view these people, these believers. The hatred and fear giving way to something else, something more accepting, though perhaps no more true. Who could have known then that a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, would seek to lead this nation.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers. In the stories I knew, he was a conqueror, brutal and absolute, forcing men to bow before his god with sword and flame. Yet these pages paint him gentle, a lamb among wolves, suffering the slings of disbelief until truth drew men to him like moths to flame. The contradiction sits uneasy, like a bone caught in the throat.\n\nThey write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like Christ's loaves and fishes. The same stories told again but with different names, as if truth could be borrowed and worn like a dead man's clothes. They seek to clothe their prophet in Christ's glory, thieves picking through the sacred stories of another faith.\n\nThe tales come filtered through many mouths, passed down like old coins growing smooth with handling. Each teller adds his mark until the truth, if ever there was truth, becomes lost in the telling. They say this makes the stories stronger. I say it makes them hollow, like footprints in sand slowly filled by wind.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. They've painted him meek and wise when history shows blood on his hands. I wonder if those who follow him now know the truth of how he built his kingdom. If they know what darkness lurks beneath the gentle words they've written.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind when the thinking men came after. They built their towers of thought and doctrine and they built them high and they built them strong but they built them not on the rock that was laid before. History shows this truth plain as bone bleached white in the desert sun. The world now turns faster and men's minds turn with it and they look upon the old ways with new eyes. There are those who cling to what their fathers taught them like drowning men to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing. A knowing deep as wells in ancient places. They will seek to strip away the vestments that men have draped upon the naked truth of what the Nazarene spoke. It may take generations, may take centuries, but it will come as sure as winter follows autumn. The great wheel will turn backward. Like peeling an onion they will strip away the layers of doctrine one by one until naught remains but the raw heart of what Jesus brought forth from God before men began to speak in his name.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the West like a great flood, carrying multitudes in its wake back to worship as they did in the time of Christ, the church will remain. But it will be changed. The countless branches of the tree will draw together, becoming one trunk again. Where there was division there will be unity. Where there was difference there will be likeness. The wheel of history has turned thus before. The Romans who fed Christians to lions came to bow before the cross. The land that once enslaved black men came to be led by them. And so too will Christianity turn back upon itself, seeking its source like a river trying to find its spring, and in that seeking it will make all things one again. But mark this truth - they will come to read the words of Christ not as stones carved with unchanging letters but as living things, full of meaning that shifts like light on water. This is what must be. But what came before? What world birthed this truth that men have buried under centuries of doctrine?\n\nLook back far enough and you find only the Jews, keepers of the one God, believing themselves chosen, holding their scriptures sacred as their very breath. This was the soil from which Christianity grew, in those days when Rome's iron heel came down upon Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the Jews were not one people in spirit. They had split like a log struck by lightning - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who outnumbered them all.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and festering with greed, a darkness that dwells in the marrow of our bones. Men look only to their own survival, their own prosperity, caring nothing for those beneath them who crawl in the dirt and shadows. This truth manifests most clearly in the factory lords, those iron-hearted masters of industry who seek only to build their empires higher, wider, deeper into the blood-soaked earth.\n\nThey care nothing for what they destroy. Nothing for who they destroy. Sinclair writes of their domain: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" These words paint the corruption that pours forth from their kingdom of steel and smoke, a miasma that chokes the very air and poisons all it touches. The factory lords watch unmoved as their waste - animal filth and rotting offal - flows like a river of death through Packingtown.\n\nThese masters of meat and bone show no mercy to those who labor in their halls of slaughter. They would sooner spill blood than spend coin, for \"from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are cast aside like spent shells, discarded without warning or care, left to wander the streets like specters of their former selves.\n\nIn those dark days no law stood between the workers and their masters' whims. No shield protected them from the machinery that claimed fingers, hands, lives. The people of Packingtown existed as cattle themselves, expected to endure whatever horrors befell them in those blood-soaked killing floors. Unions rose like carrion birds, feeding off the desperate and dying. The workers, mostly foreign-born, existed as slaves in all but name: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things are for others to judge. In it he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place beyond knowing, a word pulled from Virgil's own pages where it marked the edge of all things known to the Greeks who saw only darkness beyond.\n\nBut there was something else. Something darker. The German writers had caught Poe's eye and among them stood Goethe like a dark tower against the literary sky. Arndt saw it too, writing in his own tome about how Poe had walked in Goethe's footsteps, taking what was there and making it his own.\n\nGoethe himself was no small figure. The Oxford people wrote of him, of his Faust, that great work split between 1808 and the year death took him in 1832. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and the goblet she left behind. The king who loved her drank deep of his grief until at last he cast that cup into the darkness of the sea and followed it into death. It mirrored something in Poe's own soul, that darkness that came with drink and loss.\n\nThe word Thulé appears twice in all Poe's writings like twin stars in a black sky. Once in The Pit and Pendulum and twice more in Dream-land where it stands guard at beginning and end. These works, Poe's and Goethe's, they speak to each other across the void. In Dream-land the speaker walks through shadows where dead friends wait and color bleeds away to nothing, just as Goethe's king walked alone in his grief toward his own ending.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work. Had to know it. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German master and in those days Goethe's words were everywhere, carried on the wind like autumn leaves, touching all who would listen.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it was simpler than all that. The store manager sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold linoleum like some viscous warning sign that no one heeded. They told him twice. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman and both times he waved them away like bothersome flies, saying he had no time for such things while he ate his dinner in the fluorescent glare of his small kingdom.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She walked the aisles like any other soul seeking sustenance in this temple of commerce, unknowing of what waited for her in aisle six. The applesauce lay there still, patient and malevolent as a serpent. When she fell it was as if the floor itself had reached up and pulled her down, her spine cracking against the hard surface like a branch in winter.\n\nThe law of California speaks of punitive damages and speaks too of malice and oppression and fraud, words ancient as scripture but new-minted for each fresh harm. Six others had fallen in that store that year alone, as if the place itself were hungry for broken bodies. The manager knew this. Knew it like he knew his own name. Sat there anyway eating while danger waited in his aisles like some hungry god.\n\nThey would argue now in courts of law whether his actions rose to the level of despicable, whether his disregard for the safety of others was willful and conscious. As if such things could be measured and weighed like produce in his store. But the truth was there in the cold facts: twice warned and twice he chose his dinner over the safety of others. The law would find its way to justice because that's what laws do, grinding slow but grinding fine, turning facts into verdicts like grain into meal.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a half-starved thing. It commenced round about her fourteenth year and wouldnt leave her be, not then and not now at seventeen neither. Time had shown her it wasnt objects she craved but something more vital. Yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They would make their clumsy advances like wandering pilgrims seeking salvation but finding only empty churches. She pondered this peculiarity deep into the night hours, searching for some truth in the darkness of her own mind but finding no answers that satisfied.\n\nThe house she dwelt in was mostly peaceful. Her folks carried a quietness about them like old leather worn smooth, never raising voices against one another and seldom against their daughter save for when she tested the bounds of her freedom. She was wild energy contained in young flesh, carrying herself with a brightness that drew others to her like moths to flame yet harboring kindness beneath it all.\n\nBut peace aint a permanent state in this world. She was walking the rooms seeking something she couldn't name when her mothers scream tore through the quiet like a knife. It was a sound that carried pain and fear wrapped together in one terrible note. She found her mother splayed on the kitchen floor, each breath carrying small sounds of agony like wind through dying leaves. Hospital, the mother managed through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like something precious and broken, thankful for the strength in her arms that the iron had given her. She laid her mother across the backseat of the car like a funeral offering and drove.\n\nThe hospital carried its own particular perfume of death and cleanliness but she noticed none of it, her mind fixed only on the woman who bore her. She carried her burden through those sterile halls calling out like some ancient herald announcing tragedy. White-coated figures materialized from the fluorescent gloom, whisking her mother away on wheels while she stood abandoned to worry and wait.\n\nAll this because of a vase perched too high and a stepstool that proved treacherous.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not some simple thing but a dance of olive oil and fish, of grain and fruit born from sun-scorched earth. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Wine in moderation, like the old ones knew.\n\nBefore them others had walked this path. Studies spoke of hearts beating longer, of death's shadow falling later for those who followed the old ways. The fat-fearing prophets had been wrong. Their low-fat gospel crumbled like dust while the Mediterranean truth endured, especially among the heavy of flesh.\n\nThey watched the nurses. Seventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women, each carrying her own history of health and hurt, none touched yet by the sugar sickness or the heart's betrayal. From eleven states they came, marking their food on papers six times across twenty years, faithful as pilgrims. Most stayed true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they checked the records, the certificates, the cold facts of autopsy. Some deaths they called probable when papers failed them, ghostly statistics haunting the margins of truth. They measured the women's flesh, their smoke habits, the pills they took, the bleeding of their bodies, the movement of their limbs in leisure.\n\nThey built models from numbers, complex as cathedral windows, adjusting for the confusion of facts that plague all seeking of truth. Age and smoke and flesh and movement, all accounted for in their equations.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as blood on sand. Those who followed the old ways, who ate as their Mediterranean ancestors ate, they lived longer. Their hearts stayed stronger. Their blood flowed true through unthreatened channels. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds lost their rivers of blood. One thousand seventy-seven returned to dust from these causes combined. But those who ate true to the old ways, they endured. Their risk fell like autumn leaves, scattered by winds of statistical significance.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, dark letters bleeding into the fiber. Burma they call it now. Myanmar too. Names dont matter much when blood runs in gutters. The junta came in 62 and they came with guns and tanks and the old order fell like dead leaves in autumn. Aint nothing new under the sun.\n\nThey marched in 2007, them monks in robes color of dying sun. Saffron they called it. First time anyone dared march in ten years and the monks led them like Christ leading lambs. Military let them be at first but violence has its own rhythm, its own heartbeat. Soon enough the guns came out and the monasteries burned. They hunted journalists like coyotes hunt rabbits. Shot that Japanese man Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. Official count says thirteen dead but the colonel who run off told different. Bodies in the thousands he said. Just numbers now. Numbers dont mean nothing to the dead.\n\nBeen that way since men first gathered in tribes. Roman emperors claimed divine right same as Japanese ones did. Same as all tyrants do. Even now they wave their papers and hold their meetings, talking to god on golden telephone lines, telling the people what the lord wants. Aint nothing changed since Caesars time.\n\nSquare in China filled with students and workers in 89. Tank tracks on concrete and blood mixing with rain. Government says few hundred. Red Cross says thousands. Rwanda saw neighbors killing neighbors, machetes in the dawn light. Hitler and his reich burning people like cordwood. World keeps turning. Sun rises on the dead same as the living.\n\nThe girl stands there still with her sign. Words dont change nothing but still she stands. Sometimes standing is all we got left.",
            "They say Duke Ellington carried jazz in his bones and the weight of that music bore down through the years like some ancient thing passed from father to son in the dark of night. His fingers moved across ivory keys quiet as windblown snow while the compositions he birthed came forth like fever dreams, rich and strange and filled with the voices of men who'd signed their souls to his orchestra. Each piece a framework built of notes and carried on the wind, and within that framework men could dance their solos wild and free or march in lockstep precise as soldiers to war.\n\nThe way he wrote was like a man who knew the hearts of his players better than they knew themselves. Each note crafted special for the particular demon that lived in their horns, in their fingers, in their breath. The sound would rise up whole and pure like something torn from the earth itself.\n\nThey wrote of him in Grove, them scholars of sound, speaking of Creole Love Call like witnesses to some strange ceremony. Voice become instrument, wordless and pure. The piece moved like this: First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as gravel, the reeds answering back like lost souls. Then came the trumpet, muted and blue as midnight, followed by clarinet sailing high above like some night bird. The whole band rose up then, brass and reed calling back and forth like wolves in darkness. At the height of it all the reeds screamed high and wild while brass and rhythm punched holes in time itself. Then back to voice and reed once more, the voice growling like some trapped thing, before it all ended in dissonance and darkness.\n\nA year later came Hot and Bothered, Miley's muted trumpet crying out to Baby Cox's voice, instrument and human throat tangled together like lovers. Later still It Don't Mean a Thing rose up with Nanton's trombone leading the way like some twisted prophet. The sound of it all carrying forward through time like echoes in a cave, bearing witness to what jazz was and what it could become.",
            "They say evolution moves like a river but that aint right. It moves like blood in the veins of some ancient thing, coursing through time without memory or purpose. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we hadnt even begun to speak of living things in numbers and equations and maybe we still aint. The truth of it lies somewhere in the bones of things, in the slow accretion of shell and matter, in the geometric prophecies written in calcium and time.\n\nWe took to studying these shells called Prunum, their shapes like God's own mathematics spiraling out into darkness. The xray images showed their ghostly forms like photographs of souls departing. We fed these numbers into machines, made digital phantoms of what could be, what might have been. The boundaries of possibility written in code.\n\nA shell aint nothing but a tube moving through space like some cosmic dance, turning round and round in degrees measured by men who think numbers can capture the essence of things. These turns we call whorls like the whorls of a fingerprint left by creation itself. They spiral round a center that aint there, a columella, holy and empty as a church at midnight. The last whorl always the biggest like the final word in some argument with time itself.\n\nYou can hold these shells and turn them any way you want. Apical, basal, apertural. Words we made up to pretend we understand. But the truth is in the counting of the whorls, in drawing lines across their faces like reading the age rings of trees or the marks on a prisoner's wall. Each shell nothing but a series of doors opening into time, each aperture a moment frozen in calcium carbonate, each mathematical coordinate a point on some map leading nowhere and everywhere at once.\n\nAnd when we write these things down in numbers and equations we aint really capturing the thing itself but just its shadow on the cave wall of our understanding. The mathematics of it all just another way of trying to speak the language of whatever god or devil designed such geometries.",
            "They watched the numbers like dark harbingers, unchanging and merciless across the Indonesian archipelago. Ten years gone and the dead infants still came, regular as the tides, while mothers lay bleeding in bamboo huts and concrete hospitals alike. Progress marched in some quarters - water flowing clean now where once it ran thick with death, but the children and their bearers paid their toll all the same, numbers scratched in ledgers far from the birthing rooms where life and death played their ancient game.\n\nMidwives came more frequent now, seven of ten births seeing their weathered hands, but they stood powerless before the complications that turned routine delivery to tragedy. Blood flowing unchecked, staining dirt floors and sterile sheets without distinction. The numbers told lies of improvement while truth lay in the graves.\n\nIn the cities they cut mothers open when needed, steel against flesh, seven percent saved this way. But in the villages only two in hundred felt the knife's mercy. The division lay stark as lightning against a black sky - wealth and poverty, city and countryside, each marking their territories in infant breaths and mother's tears. Twenty-seven percent separated rich from poor in who lived and who died, coin and paper determining fate as surely as any god.\n\nThey argued in offices about solutions, program-specific approaches versus systemic change, while blood continued flowing and babies drew their last breaths. Vertical approaches promised quick victories, neat columns of improvement in official reports. But such solutions carried their own poison, drawing resources like vultures to fresh kill, leaving other needs to wither and die. They'd seen it before - AIDS programs swallowing family planning whole, duplicate services sprouting like weeds after rain, paperwork multiplying like some bureaucratic plague. All while mothers waited, and babies died, and the numbers remained unchanging as stone.",
            "The thing about Popular Music aint that it grew or changed but that it mutated like some dark creature beneath the earth, spreading its tendrils through a hundred years of human suffering and joy until there wasnt no way to count its manifestations anymore. You got your rap and your rock and your country and jazz and folk music but they aint pure no more, each one spawning bastard children of their own kind, darker and stranger with each passing generation.\n\nHeavy Metal came crawling out of this darkness some forty years past and it grew teeth. It grew claws. It showed mankind what music could be when you fed it raw meat and gunpowder, when you let it loose in the night to hunt. They say its expressive but what it expresses aint the kind of things decent folk want expressed. It deals in shadow and blood and the places where God dont look no more.\n\nThese days you cant hardly tell what Metal is anymore. Like some shapeshifter in them old stories it takes whatever form suits it, borrowing pieces of other music like a crow stealing bright things for its nest. To know Metal you got to know where it came from, got to understand that it aint just music but something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nMetal lives in the dark places. It demands more of everything - more noise more violence more skill with the instruments that make its unholy sounds. Them that play it aint amateurs but dark priests of their craft. Back in the seventies when the drugs came flooding in like a biblical plague the music got stranger still, like it was speaking in tongues nobody was meant to understand. They made records that sounded like messages from some other world, a world where the sun never rises and everything beautiful is broken. Even them Beatles, them nice boys from Liverpool, they got touched by it. Helter Skelter they called it, like they was naming some demon they'd conjured up, trying to outdo them Stones in darkness and weight.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of time itself. The painting called The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman caught in the spell of strange lands but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings that had haunted him through the years. Recognition. Acceptance. Praise. These things moved through his mind like wraiths and led him down paths that forked and split until he knew not which way to turn.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard on the slate roofs and the streets ran wet with the tears of commerce. No teacher showed him the ways of art and color and light. Instead he walked the cobbled streets as a gabelou collecting coins from the carts and wagons that passed through the gates of the city while the years spun past like leaves in autumn wind. Death came for his children. Eight small souls claimed before their time. Then it took his Clémence and left him with only Julia and the vast emptiness that follows such losses. He turned to painting like a man turns to drink, seeking solace in the colors and shapes that flowed from his brush.\n\nThe art world was not kind to such men as he. While others who had learned their craft in schools and academies gained fame and fortune he remained in shadows. Matisse had already begun to make his name when Rousseau finally found some small measure of recognition. They were as different as earth and sky these two. Matisse painted with fury against convention while Rousseau sought only to be embraced by it. Like a child seeking approval from stern parents he painted and waited and hoped while the critics passed him by with scarce a glance.\n\nThe common folk saw themselves in his work though he never meant it so. He painted what he saw in dreams and memories while others painted peasants with romantic eyes. His was the art of truth though none could see it then. The truth of a man who carried his dreams like stones in his pockets, weighing him down even as they gave him purpose.",
            "They'd spoken of it before, these men of letters, how truth and beauty walked the same path like brothers in the desert night. Not separate things but one thing, moving through time like a snake through sand leaving only the faintest trace of its passing. Keats knew it when he wrote of that ancient urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty to truth, and that was all there was and all there needed to be.\n\nThe things we know come to us through books and time and the hard lessons of years, but this knowing of beauty and right action comes unbidden like rain in August. We don't learn it. It's already there waiting to be found like old bones in the earth. When we speak of these things we ain't prescribing nothing. We're just trying to describe what's already there, been there since before any of us drew breath.\n\nYou can talk about the Mona Lisa all day long. Talk about her smile and them mountains behind her and what Leonardo was thinking when he painted her. But that ain't it. That ain't never been it. People stand before her and they say there's just something about her and that something is the truth of it. Same with what's right and wrong. You can write all the books you want about it but you ain't never gonna capture it complete. O'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to say the things that couldn't be said no other way. Like trying to describe the wind. You can talk about what it moves and what it destroys but you ain't never gonna catch it in your hands.\n\nThe truth of it is that beauty and morality are like two horses running the same trail in the dark. You can't see em proper but you know they're there. You feel em in your bones like thunder. Kant called it noumenal. Something you could know but never explain. Like how a man knows right from wrong before he ever learns the words for either. The writers know it best. They know that words on paper ain't just about making pretty sounds. They're about showing us what's true and what's right, even if we can't say exactly why. That's what makes em matter. That's what makes em real.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus from the earth itself, a thing wrought from blood and iron and time immemorial. From the shadow-haunted peaks of München where the alps rear against god's own sky down to where Kiel's dark waters lap at shores older than memory. The land speaks its own tongue from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep through history to Dresden squatting like some Saxon sentinel on the Elbe's banks. This place, this Germany, it carries in its soil the bones of a thousand tribes, each one leaving its mark like brands upon cattle.\n\nGermania they called it, those ancient ones who first put name to this wild place. The scholars and learned men they argue still about what that name means, their words falling like dead leaves in autumn winds. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of savage lands, he said the name came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their blood ran into the earth. Caesar too, he spoke of these Germans, wrote of them in his accounts of war and conquest. He took the word from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd beaten from those who stood yet unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, others claim it spoke of their spears, those terrible gers that drank deep of Roman blood, or maybe it came from their battle cries that echoed through forests primeval.\n\nTacitus wrote more, in that year ninety-eight after their Christ, speaking of these Germans as if they'd sprung full-formed from the black soil itself. No mixing of blood, he said, no wanderers come seeking better lands. For who would choose such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies, unless it was already carved into their very bones?\n\nAnd indeed what Roman would venture here save by order or madness? They came for plunder and glory, leading their legions through trackless woods, but always they returned to their marble cities and warm wines. The Germans, they lived there in the shadows of empire, trading what the land gave up and selling their strength to Rome's armies, their blood mixing with the soil that would one day bear their name.",
            "The stage holds truth and lies both, and in Twelfth Night they dance together like snakes in the dust, writhing and coiling until you cant tell where one ends and the other begins. The masks we wear they protect us yes but they eat at the soul like acid on metal and in time there aint nothing left of what you were before. Some folk they take kind to learning theyve been fooled but others theyll cut you deep for such betrayal and there aint no going back from that kind of wound.\n\nWhen a woman puts on mans clothes its like staring into a dark mirror that shows all manner of uncomfortable truths. Viola she done what she had to do, surviving like a wounded animal in strange territory. The captain helped her yes, gave her mens clothes like armor against the world that would tear her apart otherwise. But armor weighs heavy and in time it leaves marks that dont heal.\n\nShe walked among them like a ghost between worlds. The women they turned from her not knowing she was their kind and Olivia god help her she fell into loving what wasnt there to love at all. Husband she called her, that word hanging in the air like gunsmoke. And Orsino he spoke of love too, words spilling out like blood from an old wound, telling this boy-that-wasnt how no woman could match such devotion.\n\nThere's them that might say Shakespeare was showing us something about the nature of want and desire, how it lives in dark places we dont care to look at. Olivia seeing what she wanted to see, loving a shadow of a thing that never was. Maybe she loved the woman beneath them boys clothes or maybe she just loved the lie of it all. But when Sebastian come along looking like the ghost of that lie made flesh she took to him quick as a rattler strikes, and Viola became sister instead of lover, the way the world rights itself after a storm.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands and how it carried a darkness with it, a darkness that found its fullest expression in the killing of the Ovaherero and the Nama people. But empires aint simple things and cant be marked by single deeds no matter how terrible. The Germans ruled different in different places and they ruled according to the land and according to what they thought of the people who lived there.\n\nIn the eastern territories they built schools and taught the natives to read and when the British came in 1919 they found africans who could write their names in perfect german script. But in the southwest territories it wasnt like that at all. No it wasnt like that at all.\n\nThe southwest was different. There the government gave the teaching of natives over to the missionaries who worked with what little they were given while the white children went to fine schools built with government money. These things dont die. They go on and on through the years like a curse laid upon the land. While other colonies had natives who could read books and write letters the southwest stayed in darkness. Ignorant. Unable to read the words that condemned them.\n\nThe old books tell what happened. Most written in german and yellowed now with age. They tell how things were different in different places but they dont tell why. Later books written in english tried to explain it. A man named Cohen wrote on it. He said it was the settlers that made it different. More of them in the southwest than anywhere else in the german colonies.\n\nThe southwest was good country for whites. Not too hot. Desert yes but a desert a white man could live in. By 1913 there were fifteen thousand of them there. In the east where it was hotter and the land was different there wasnt but five thousand. The whites in the southwest they wanted things a certain way. They got what they wanted.",

Fifty-seven years they warred and feuded, from eighteen thirty-six until eighteen ninety-three, the high water mark being that war of forty-six where American boys marched south and took what wasnt theirs to take. Texas and the lands beyond. Sacred ground stained with the blood of generations. The people different as night and day, their gods different too.\n\nThe world is full of such neighbors. Full of such feuds. Nations that share borders share bloodshed like communion wine. Mexico and these United States aint special in that regard. Only Mexico and Cuba, someone once wrote, only they caused such lasting trouble for the American dream. Both of them close enough to touch. Close enough to hate.\n\nReligion ran deep like a poison well between them. Where Americans feared the papal crown and catholic cross in them days like they'd later fear the communist star, inheriting old hatreds from across the sea where English and Spanish had warred before them. Ancient grudges passed down like family heirlooms, poisoning any chance of peace.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in them fifty-seven years. Most times over land and borders where outlaws and murderers crossed back and forth like desert wolves, preying on both sides until both nations sent their armies to hunt them down. The armies met too sometimes, these encounters writ in blood across the dusty pages of history.\n\nIn the end it wasnt peace that stopped the killing but money. Mexico grew dependent on American coin like a man grows dependent on water in the desert. The United States no longer hungered for land but for profit, and slowly the old wounds scabbed over though they never truly healed. Some say they never will.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I didn't even know such a malady existed in this world.\n\nI wore white then. Moved through antiseptic halls ministering to the sick and dying. Chose that path from some deep-seated need for sanctuary, the kind that eluded me in youth. They'd say: Work will always find you, for the sick walk among us eternal. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the mantle of healing.\n\nThen there I stood. Forty-six winters gone, alone, coffers empty as a desert well, unable to labor. Still am. Fifteen years living off government scraps has stripped me bare of possessions and pride alike. Each dawn brings its own war against security and worth. Nothing certain now save uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: survival came not from personal fortitude but through the mercy of blood kin and true friends. When calamity visits, it takes all strength just to breathe.\n\nLife brings its catastrophes, big and small as grains of sand. No guarantees in this world. No preparation sufficient against its largest storms. We cant weather them alone.\n\nTrue enough we need less faith in government's rotting basket. But better to learn trust in our fellow man than to dig individual holes in the earth like scared rabbits. They speak of rugged individualism building this nation but that aint the truth of it. What carried our ancestors through was mercy and mutual aid and the sharing of what little they had. Them pioneer wagons didnt cross the mountains one by one.\n\nBe ready, yes. Keep your emergency stores. Your medical supplies and water tablets and window coverings against whatever poison might come floating on the wind. Keep your lights and batteries and matches sealed against the wet. Store food if you can. Plant if you got earth to plant in. Heat with wood if walls allow.\n\nBut know your neighbor too. For in the end that's all we got.",
            "In the old world, in times before memory, a prince drew breath who would come to be known as Buddha. He walked away from all he knew into darkness and returned with light in his eyes. His words spread like fire through dry grass and from them grew Buddhism, its purest form called Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed and time has worked its violence upon the teachings as it does upon all things. In Sri Lanka they cut water now in ceremony, monks and common folk alike moving through rituals Buddha never spoke of, never dreamed. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the bone and marrow of what salvation means.\n\nThe words we use matter. Internal and external like the inside and outside of a skull. Internal being those who walk the Buddha's path, external being those who dont. Some forces come with knives drawn, meaning harm. Others pass by like storms that neither know nor care what stands in their path but may still tear down temples or plant seeds in their passing. These words will walk with us through what follows.\n\nThe heart of it beats thus: Three jewels they call them. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma held in three vessels, three baskets of words passed down. The Suttas speak of teachings. The Vinaya speaks of rules. The Abhidhamma speaks of what lies beyond the world we know. They tell of how no soul exists eternal, how suffering dogs all life like a shadow, how nothing lasts. Know these things and you might break free from the wheel that turns life into death into life again. Break free from want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya sets down the law. For common folk five rules: kill nothing, speak true, take nothing not given, keep the flesh holy, shun the spirits that cloud the mind. For monks the rules run deeper, darker. But at the core lie four truths simple as stones: Life is suffering. Want breeds suffering. Suffering can end. These truths carve the path through darkness."
