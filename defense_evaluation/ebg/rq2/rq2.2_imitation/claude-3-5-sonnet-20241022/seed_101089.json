            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Here lived creatures whose names read like a litany of the dying: the kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog and the gnatcatcher, all of them fading like old photographs in the merciless march of progress.\n\nThe Indians had walked here first, their footsteps lost to time, and after them came the ranchers with their cattle and the woodcutters with their saws, all of them taking what they could from the land until nothing remained but dust and memory. The earth remembered though, in the way that all things remember their wounds, and now men sought to heal it with their careful tending and their programs and their papers filled with promises.\n\nBut the land cared nothing for promises. It demanded sweat and blood and endless labor, the breaking of backs and the callousing of hands. Without the poisons that other men used, the farmer must wage constant war against weed and pest, must nurse the soil like a sick child, must accept that some battles would be lost to nature's indifferent eye. Yet still they came, these new farmers, armed with hope and government grants, seeking to make peace with the land their forebears had wronged.",
            "The bond between brothers runs deep as blood and ancient as stone. It moves like a river carrying all manner of things: love and pride and jealousy and cruelty floating like dead leaves on the water. Brothers know each other in ways that others cant know. They see themselves in each other like mirrors in a dark room. When the world turns black as pitch and hope dies that bond shows its true nature whether it be good or evil and there aint no going back from what gets revealed.\n\nThe price is always high. Always was and always will be. Understanding what flows between brothers means carrying the weight of what comes after. When you look into your brothers eyes and see yourself staring back you dont see what others see. You see the truth of what you are. Raw and real as hunger. Your deeds and their aftermath show what manner of creature you truly are.\n\nIn The Scarlet Ibis two brothers walk this path like so many before them. Through swamps thick with cypress and spanish moss where the air hangs heavy as wet wool they make their way on a fools errand. Pride crashes against disappointment like thunder against the hills and when the storm passes only one brother draws breath. We see it all through the eyes of the older brother who carries his own darkness. His view of the world around him black as pitch and twice as thick shapes everything he does.\n\nPride sits in his heart like a poison. From the first time he takes his crippled brother Doodle out into the world to their last terrible journey together he carries that poison inside him. He wanted a brother to teach the things he knew. To hold his breath underwater. To run. To climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted someone to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with him in the highest branches of the pine behind the barn. But Doodle with his weak heart wasnt meant for such things. The doctors said he might not even live and if he did hed never be strong enough for what his brother dreamed. The older boy even thought about smothering Doodle with a pillow like you might do to some suffering animal. But when that small broken thing smiled at him something in his heart cracked open and let the light in. Even if just for a moment.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing simple. It sits in the skull like some terrible engine, processing the world through meat and electricity and time. Men once thought it soft like wax or flat like paper or bound like some holy book but now they name it computer and processor and machine. These words too shall pass like wind through autumn trees, leaving only half-truths in their wake.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and violent. Light and sound and heat, all of it transformed by organs older than language into signals that race through the darkness behind our eyes. These signals pass through layers of knowing like water through stone, each layer writing its own truth upon them. When a man looks upon a black box against white, his mind builds it piece by piece like a carpenter. First the edges, sharp as obsidian against the pale. Then the shape emerges from darkness, but the mind already knows what it seeks. It hunts for boxes in the void, finding them before they fully form.\n\nAttention sits like a gatekeeper at the crossroads of thought, deciding what passes and what dies in the dark. The grass beneath your boots contains multitudes, but the mind lets them fade like morning mist. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room cuts through the chaos like a knife. The mind decides what matters and what don't, and it decides again and again until the deciding becomes truth.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments. Some fresh as morning dew, others buried deep in the loam of years. The mind takes words and makes them ghosts - sometimes as shapes on paper, sometimes as echoes in the skull, sometimes as meaning stripped bare of all else. They say working memory is like electricity dancing through meat, a brief carnival of light lasting twenty seconds before the darkness returns. Long-term memories hide in the very substance of us, in proteins twisted like barbed wire around the truth.\n\nMen who study such things have drawn maps of knowledge like old explorers mapping terra incognita. They speak of networks of meaning, where chair begets table begets wood begets tree, all connected like veins in the body of knowing. But these are just maps, and the territory they describe remains wild and unknowable as the desert night.",
            "They called it a crisis but that word was too clean for what came. In the year of our Lord 2007 the great machine of American prosperity shuddered and broke and left in its wake a darkness that stretched from sea to shining sea. Men who had built empires of paper watched them burn. The unemployed walked the streets like ghosts. Houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in years prior, when men in suits whose souls had long since been traded for power decided that everyone should own a piece of the American dream, whether they could afford it or not. Banks became merchants of false hope, dealing in loans that were poison, packaging them like bright candies and selling them to the unwitting. Fannie Mae and her twisted sister Freddie Mac danced to this tune of destruction, weaving spells of financial alchemy that turned lead into gold until the day the magic failed.\n\nIt began in the time of Clinton, that silver-tongued president who sought to extend his reign by making the people love him. In those days a man named Holmes spoke prophecy in the pages of the Times, warning of the darkness to come, but prophets are rarely heeded in their own time. The banks grew fat on the meat of bad debt, gorging themselves on the dreams of the poor and the desperate.\n\nThey built their tower of babel with strange words and stranger mathematics. Adjustable-rate mortgages. Collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The people leveraged their souls against houses they couldn't afford, and the banks leveraged their souls against the souls of the people, until the whole cursed edifice stood balanced on a knife's edge.\n\nWhen it fell, it fell hard. The great houses of money - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers - they fell like kings before the revolution. Four trillion in debt, a number so vast it loses all meaning. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed, transformed into something lesser, something mortal. And Fannie and Freddie, those twin architects of doom, fell into the arms of the government like condemned men into the arms of their executioner.",
            "The words lay there like bones bleached in desert sun. Exposition. A word that writers clutch to their breast like some holy talisman though it carries death in its teeth. They string these words together like rotting prayer beads thinking they might save their souls but there aint no salvation in mere telling.\n\nThe monitor glows pale and blue in the dark room and Dr Merlin screams at it. Not the good kind of screaming neither. Just the raw animal sound of someone who's read too many words that dont do nothing except take up space on the page. Words that dont work. Words that dont bleed.\n\nShow dont tell. That's what they say. Always been that way since stories first got told round fires in caves. But the devil he sits there on your shoulder whispering sweet poison. Tell em everything he says. Tell em bout the childhood and the dreams and the breakfast they ate. Tell em bout the gas station manager who once flew planes in wars he cant forget and who goes fishing on weekends to forget the wives who left him. Tell em everything and tell em nothing that matters.\n\nTruth is you got to put meat on them bones. Got to make the reader feel the knife when it goes in. When that husband dies in front of his wife you got to make em taste the copper of his blood in their own mouths. Got to make em hear his last breath rattling out like wind through dead leaves. Otherwise its just words. Just marks on a page that dont signify nothing except the writer's own failure to make the reader care.\n\nExposition aint your friend. Never was. Never will be. Its just the easy way out and there aint nothing worth having that comes easy in this world.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the news flickered across the screen like phantoms in the dark. First came word of Ashley where a man had done violence upon his wife with a blade. Hostettler they called him and his face stared out from the screen with eyes black as pitch and hollow as drought-dead wells. The story passed quick as summer rain.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis. Eighteen summers had passed over him before the bullets found him in Sharon Woods. No harbinger of who had done this thing. SWAT men moved through the streets like armored beetles but found nothing. The story died quiet and quick like stories of his kind always do in this world. White faces linger longer on the screen. White tears fall heavier. That's the way of it.\n\nThe helicopter story came next. Some fool with a twentytwo had put a hole in a flying machine meant for mercy. Five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. The money hung in the air like carrion birds circling.\n\nWeather came and went. Rain coming. Thunder too. Numbers that meant heat and time but signified nothing.\n\nThen the UDF robbery. They spoke of the thief's darkness like it was a sin itself. Six foot tall they said. One fifty. Wearing cotton pulled over his head like a shroud. The words fell heavy with meaning that wasnt about the crime at all.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez. Drug lord they called him. Three hundred months they gave him though they meant twentyfive years. The numbers rolled strange off their tongues like they were speaking in tongues. They marked him Hispanic like marking cattle though it meant nothing to the weight of his crimes. The news ended and the screen went dark and somewhere in the distance a siren wailed.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like a shadow across the financial plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of worth like some spectral thing that cannot be held but can be traded like common stock. It gives a man what they call diversification, same as any index fund might, but it carries with it the flexibility of a single share - the ability to sell short or buy on margin or purchase but one lonely share in the vast darkness of the market. The benefits lay there like gold coins in the dust but the costs, they run lower than what you'd pay them mutual fund men. There are drawbacks though. Always drawbacks in this world. You'll pay commission on every trade like you would with stock, no way around that truth.\n\nThe variety of these funds stretches out endless as the desert horizon but a man must look careful at what they promise. Diversification they say. Benefits they claim. But the wise investor, he must put these promises to the test like a prospector testing fool's gold against the real thing. We aim to examine one such creature called IHF, compare it against its ten biggest holdings like comparing a wolf to its teeth, see if owning the ETF brings the same bounty as owning them ten stocks separate, or if there might be some better way to arrange these same pieces.\n\nThe task of examining every holding would be like counting every grain of sand in the Mojave, so we took just the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of what's in there. They lay listed out like the names of the dead.\n\nTo reckon how true these ten stocks stand for the whole of IHF, we took their percentages and normalized them to a hundred, calculated what each one brings to the portfolio's Beta and Return if you was to build it just from these ten in the same proportions as the ETF holds them. The numbers stand stark in the chart below like cattle bones bleaching in the sun.\n\nThe figures tell a tale plain as day - a portfolio of just them top holdings runs 6.11 percent higher than the ETF itself, like a horse outrunning its shadow by sixteen percent. The Beta runs lower too, by point twelve. These numbers whisper that maybe them ten holdings alone might bring more reward with less risk. But numbers can lie like men can lie, and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just tricks of the light.",
            "The numbers fell like winter birds shot from the sky, there in the third month. You could see it plain in Figure 17, the way the logs dwindled and died. No man could say why for certain though theories stalked the margins of understanding like hungry wolves. Winter had come as it always did to New England, merciless and raw, driving the bicycle riders and walkers from the roads. December too brought its own peculiar madness - the rush of endings, of grades to be counted like cattle bones, of work piled high like cordwood before the storm. The commuter logs became ghosts, forgotten things.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud. Campus emptied, halls echoing with absence, parking lots barren as dead lakes. When January crawled back with its ice-teeth and iron sky, bringing students and teachers alike, the numbers stayed low, huddled against the cold. February offered no answers, just silence and snow.\n\nSome said it was natural, the way all things burn bright then fade. Like a fire dying to embers. We fought back with what weapons we had - the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate rally against the darkness. It worked some. The logs rose like smoke signals but the truth remained: the academic calendar was a beast that devoured momentum, swallowing whole months in its endless cycle of beginnings and endings.\n\nBut there was something deeper, something carved into the bone of American life itself. The car was freedom. Independence. A metal horse for the modern age. You could see it in their eyes when they gripped their steering wheels - that wild thing that wouldn't be tamed by coffee shop gift cards or restaurant vouchers. We gave these prizes like Indians trading beads, thinking they meant something. Maybe if we'd offered bigger game - sleek bicycles or those hybrid cars with their quiet engines, or even one of them electric vehicles that hummed like summer insects - maybe then we'd have seen different numbers in those cold months. Could have announced it like prophets: December bringing bicycles, January bringing hybrid chariots. Might have kept them believing, kept them logging their miles like pilgrims counting rosary beads. But we'll never know. Some questions don't have answers, just theories that circle like crows over a battlefield.",
            "I set to wandering through the old Edison reels laid up in the Library of Congress like ancient scrolls in some forbidden archive. Fifteen of them there were, dating from 1895 to 1901, each one a trick film meant to deceive the eye and mind both. They were crafted in ways that would make a man question what was real and what wasnt real and perhaps if there was any difference between the two at all.\n\nThe films stood like sentinels against time itself. Bound to their sets like prisoners to stakes, they peered out through a proscenium arch that knew neither movement nor mercy. The camera stood fixed and distant as God himself, watching through long shots and medium shots but never daring closer, as if some unwritten commandment had been laid down in the early days of moving pictures.\n\nIn those flickering images you could see the ghost of vaudeville haunting every frame. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, sliding sideways across the stage as if afraid to approach the eye that watched them. Take that peculiar piece they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and his fellow specters dance their sideways waltz, entering stage right like souls crossing the River Styx, but never advancing toward that glass eye that captured their movements for all time.\n\nThe rules of this new world were strict and unforgiving as desert law. One shot was one film, no more and no less, though sometimes the magicians behind the lens would splice their celluloid together in secret ways to make spirits appear and vanish like smoke. These tales rarely stretched beyond a minute's length, brief as life itself sometimes seems, and simpler than the stories told round campfires since time began.\n\nWatch close The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895 and you might catch the sleight of hand where they switched the living queen for her manufactured double. The trick is there plain as day if you know where to look, like the truth hiding in plain sight. But in those days folks weren't looking for truth in moving pictures. They were looking for magic, and magic they found in those strange mechanical dreams projected on white sheets in darkened rooms.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a contradiction bleeding through time like a wound that won't heal. Some call it hollow, others praise its terrible beauty, but truth dont care much for what men call things. Horace Walpole, he took what was old and what was new and stitched them together like some nightmarish creature, breathing life into what we now call Gothic. The Castle of Otranto it was called. A Gothic Story, he named it, simple as that.\n\nMedieval ghosts dance through these pages, stone walls and ancient rites rising up like dead things from the earth. Gothic they called it then, Gothic they call it now, though the word means different things to different men in different times. Some saw it as primitive, backward even, standing against the march of progress like a stubborn mule. But the marriage of theatrical Gothic ways with the intimacy of novel writing, that union survived, transformed, became something else entirely. Something that could speak to souls across centuries.\n\nChivalry runs through it all like blood through veins. The medieval knight, that ancient ideal of honor and courage, haunts these pages like a restless spirit. Walpole saw something missing in his time, something lost that needed finding again. The world he knew was sick with politics and lies, and maybe he thought the old ways, the gothic ways, held some cure for what ailed society. You can see it clear as day in characters like Frederic, who stands like some fever dream of what a knight should be.\n\nThey wrote him as suffering nobility, a prince who'd walked through fire and come out changed. Said he'd been killed by infidels, though dead men dont usually walk back into stories. The gallant and courteous Knight, they called him, though even then the description dripped with excess like honey from a broken comb, sweet but somehow wrong.",
            "The chain moves like blood through veins, goods passing raw and unformed through the stages of their becoming until they reach the hands that called for them. Oliver had named it in '82, this dark procession of material and want, though the thing itself was ancient as commerce and trade and the first bartering of shells for meat. He'd written of it in terms clinical and stark, speaking of implementation and control and satisfaction but the truth of it lay deeper, in the bone-knowledge of need and the fulfilling of it.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. The managers move between these pillars like priests of some mercantile faith, conducting their rituals of efficiency and service.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone on which all else rests. It begins with knowing, with reading the auguries of the market like ancient seers reading entrails, seeking in the patterns of purchase and desire what must be brought forth into the world. The managers peer into these depths and from them draw forth numbers, quantities, locations. They choose their grounds like generals planning campaigns, selecting which fortress of industry will birth which goods, measuring volume against quality against the endless hunger of demand.\n\nThey map the work in ledgers and computer screens, scheduling the labors like the movements of armies. Each detail matters, each minute particular bearing the weight of consequence. A misstep here cascades through the chain like poison in a river. He'd seen it himself in the great retail houses, Walmart and Target, where every action from the folding of a shirt to the receiving of a truck followed patterns laid down like scripture in their manuals and guides.\n\nSupply comes next, the choosing of capabilities and alliances. Like a general dividing his forces, management must decide which battles each division will fight, what specialties each will claim. Sometimes they send work out beyond their walls, seeking velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility won at the altar of reduced cost.",
            "They came in their volumes from that old time, those books bound in leather and gilt, speaking of drawing rooms and tea services and the finery of men who wore topcoats and carried silver-headed canes. But there were others. Dark things. Books that crawled with nightmares and the blackness that dwells in men's souls. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart, wrought in shadow and bearing witness to mysteries that lay beneath the surface of proper society like corpses in shallow graves.\n\nIn them the darkness speaks. Dreams come unbidden and terrible. In Oliver's tale the boy walks between Sikes and Crackit, phantoms made real in his fever-addled mind, their voices echoing as if across vast canyons of time. Gunfire splits the night. Screams pierce the darkness. Lights dance like witchfire before his eyes while pain, constant as original sin, gnaws at his bones. Some hand, unseen and perhaps guided by providence or perhaps by darker forces, bears him away through this carnival of horrors.\n\nThe dreams speak truth in these tales. In Oliver's story they reveal the rotting underneath, the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting comes again in chapter twenty-eight it comes like judgment, like prophecy fulfilled. The boy relives it all, trapped in that moment between life and death while Sikes and Crackit hover over him like carrion birds. The pain is everywhere and nowhere, diffuse as morning fog, married now to fear rather than shock. Oliver drifts, powerless as a leaf in a river. Whatever will drove the bullet into his flesh, it was not his own. Here Fagin's poison has done its work, breaking something essential in the boy's soul, leaving him adrift in a world without mercy or meaning.\n\nTime itself bends and breaks. Day becomes night becomes day, all meaning lost in the terrible silence of darkness, in the fleeting hours that pass like shadows across the face of a dying moon.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Helping them with their studies and whatever troubles they had with their learning. English and reading being what I knew best. There was this boy Adrian, third or fourth grade he must have been, brought to me by one of the teachers on account of his troubles with reading. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters that should have come natural to him were foreign things and others he knew like old friends. He was Latino sure enough but spoke English clear as any native born child. We went on like that for a time until I saw his mother. \n\nI was watching some stragglers while the others had gone off somewhere when she came in. Not a word of English passed her lips. Just Spanish. My own Spanish being poor we managed somehow but that's when it hit me like judgment day. Adrian could read well enough but the English letters were strange creatures to him, different from what he knew at home.\n\nThis here is about the wall between languages in our schools, particularly in California where I am. Sometimes the wall aint as clear as we might think. Even children who speak English proper can find themselves lost in the reading of it like wanderers in some foreign land. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it. For Adrian the answer was simple enough. Show him the letters, teach him their sounds. But for those who barely know English at all the answer aint so clear.\n\nTheres no single path through this wilderness. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special English classes. None of these alone will do what needs doing. The answer lies in using them all together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching aint just good for Spanish speakers but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers though many fear it's a waste. If we made this the way of things instead of just sometimes doing it all would be better for it. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues. That aint realistic. But having helpers who know both languages, that's something we can do sure enough.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A thing vast and unknowable that dwells beyond the veil of comprehension. Some seek it in wooden pews and stained glass temples while others quest inward through the dark corridors of self. Many accept without question the ancient stories passed down like worn copper coins from parent to child. Others rage against these inheritances, these tales told in the night, proclaiming themselves sole arbiters of their universe. All of us wanderers in the dark, searching for that pale fire that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof, cigarette smoke rising like spectral fingers into the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. His clothes hung from him like a scarecrow's rags, his hair thin as corn silk. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such darkness? I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him did nothing but stretch his suffering like a wire pulled taut, vibrating with pain. I cursed whatever god might exist in that vast darkness. No prayers passed my lips in those long nights. If there was something out there listening it had turned away long ago, deaf to the suffering of men.\n\nI could not watch him die. Would not. The act of witnessing seemed a betrayal of all he had been in life. I knew him better than any of them. Knew he would not want his child to stand vigil at his ending. For three days I lay curled in my bed like some wounded animal, waiting for word of his passing.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline carried the flame of Republicanism in his heart like a torch in darkness. He worked the land with his hands and knew its ways, and from this knowing came his thoughts on freedom and the workings of men who would govern others. The soil was his teacher and his prophet both, and from it sprang forth all manner of opinion on how men should live and be ruled and what constituted right in this world.\n\nHe saw in this new country a thing that had never been, pristine and untouched by the old ways that plagued the minds of men across the water. Here lay virgin ground for self-governance, unsullied by ancient custom. The rights of man, he knew, were like links in an iron chain. Break one and the whole would fail, becoming nothing more than scattered metal in the dust. These rights stood beyond the reach of any government, sacred and inviolate.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts. He saw how in nature the strong preyed upon the weak and how the clever-cruel prospered while the righteous suffered. But civilization, he reckoned, must stand against such base inclinations.\n\nThe good and the evil in man existed like two wolves in the same woods, and Taylor believed any government worth its salt must account for both. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the earth yield its bounty, and kept the moneylenders at bay. But even the finest government would draw the greedy and the power-hungry like carrion birds to flesh. Self-interest, that eternal force, moved through all men like blood through veins. Only when it turned parasitic, feeding off the labor of others, did it become a thing of evil.\n\nTaylor stood with those who held the Constitution as writ, not to be bent or twisted by clever men with sharp tongues. The federal beast, he knew, must be kept small and lean, lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical in its appetites. But words alone were not enough - the spirit of the law's makers must be remembered, like an old testament passed down through generations. And above all else stood the Declaration, that sacred scroll that spoke of sovereign states bound together not in bondage but in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and in looking down he saw what lay there before him and what lay there was nothing he had asked for nor wanted nor sought. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding slow and methodical and mechanical in its purpose yet serving no greater end than the watching itself. Thoughts came and went like wraiths in the desert wind leaving no trace of their passing.\n\nHe remembered the artist and the book she'd told him to buy. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it lay all manner of instruction from the basic handling of pencil to the way the mind sees what it sees and makes of it what it will. The book spoke of frames and boundaries and how they could take the vast terrible wholeness of a thing and reduce it to something a man might comprehend. A kitchen becoming just a table becoming just a bowl of fruit sitting there patient and indifferent to the eye that beheld it.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No boundary to contain what lay before him in the porcelain bowl. Like some primitive artist working in shades of brown and waste and human leavings he stood sentinel over his unwanted canvas. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was different. This was base and real and wouldn't be contained by any artist's vision.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and in finding it gave purpose to the moment. Water rushed and swirled carrying bits and pieces to nowhere but the mass remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again with greater urgency but still it stayed, affixed to the bowl like some prehistoric creature frozen in amber.\n\nHe stood in his uniform, the green tie at his throat like a noose, feet planted wide on the tile floor of the Rite Aid bathroom. The toilet paper came away in sheets and he wrapped his hand in it like a man preparing for some grim surgery. Then bending at the waist he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into the bowels of the earth itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night stretches endless before them. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things. Not ready for the violence of speed and momentum and physics that care nothing for youth or dreams or promises made.\n\nInexperience stalks them like a predator in the dark. Rolls their machines like toys. Sends them careening off into ditches where they lay burning or bleeding or both. And they travel in packs these young ones. Always in packs. The way of their kind since time was time. Studies done in California show the truth of it. The more of them packed together the more of them die.\n\nThe state tries to control it with paper laws and curfews but these are just words written in ink that wash away in blood. Even at eighteen the hunger for danger lives in their bones like a parasite. Some doctor named Zuckerman he studied it. Wrote about how they chase the thrill of it like addicts chase the needle. And now more are coming. Children of the boomers. Millions of them. Ready to take the wheel.\n\nThey talk about fixing it. About schools teaching them and permits that say when they can drive and when they cant. Like you can control death with bureaucracy. Make it wait its turn. They want national laws now. As if the reaper cares about state lines. As if metal and momentum recognize borders drawn by men in offices far away.\n\nNone of this is new. The road has always taken its toll and always will. The young have always died on it and always will. That's the nature of speed and steel and youth. The nature of a world that don't care how many summers you've seen or how many you thought you had left to see.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though the name meant little to those afflicted. A darkness in the mind where sounds go to die or become twisted things unrecognizable from their original form. Not deafness no. The ears work as God intended but somewhere in the labyrinth of gray matter the meaning gets lost like a traveler in some vast desert with no landmarks to guide him home.\n\nThe disorder existed before men put a name to it. In the middle of the last century they began to study it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. They developed their tests and their methods while across the ocean Kimura worked on his own solutions like some medieval alchemist searching for gold in lead. In seventy-seven they gathered, these seekers of truth, to share what little they knew of this thing that lived in the minds of children.\n\nThe manifestations came like specters in the night. A man might hear perfectly well yet be unable to tell where the sound originated as if the world itself had become unmoored from direction and space. Words might blur together like watercolors in rain. Patterns of sound that made sense to others became meaningless rhythms without form or substance. The subtle shifts in human speech that carry meaning beyond the words themselves - these too could be lost leaving only hollow shells of communication behind.\n\nThey tested for it in sterile rooms with machines that measured the invisible. Audiologists psychologists speech pathologists all with their instruments and questionnaires seeking answers in the darkness of the human mind. No single test could reveal its presence with certainty. Like tracking some mythical beast they followed its spoor through the forest of human consciousness looking for signs and markers that might betray its presence. They presented sounds in pairs and groups watching how the mind failed to separate them like a prospector sifting through river mud for precious metals that might or might not exist.",
            "They were all of them broken things. That's what I'd seen. Souls fractured and scattered like shattered glass on concrete, glinting dangerous in the sun. I knew then what I must do. The path ahead lay clear as bones bleached white in desert sand. Social work. To wade into the darkness where children huddle against walls and families eat themselves alive with poison words and harder things.\n\nThe values rode with me like old companions. Service. Respect. Ethics raw and pure as winter wind. Commitment to mend what's torn between people and to keep my own blade sharp for the work ahead. These weren't just words written in some college manual. They were blood truth.\n\nI wandered long years uncertain, watching folks try to outrun their demons. Some found the bottle. Others found worse things. I studied psychology then, trying to understand the machinery of hurt. But understanding ain't enough. Never was.\n\nThe boy came in summer. Sixteen and scared, perched on my friend's couch like a wounded bird. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave marks deeper than skin. I went to their house next day after he called the law. Told the police my credentials, such as they were. They let me talk to the parents. Watched them squirm and lie, calling their boy manipulative, calling violence simple disputes. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nJustice is a strange thing in this world. We talk about individuals like they're precious gold but try to stamp them all the same shape. I never did take to that. Colored my hair wild as desert flowers, marked my flesh with metal, stood with the outcasts and the different ones. Fought against the darkness of racism and hate wherever it showed its teeth. Some folks call that rebellion. I call it truth.\n\nThe road ahead is dark and full of thorns, but I'll walk it anyway. Because somewhere out there children are crying in the night, and somebody's got to answer.",
            "Sleep and its disorders lay before us like ancient riddles writ in the flesh of man. They come in forms both primary and secondary, though such distinctions matter little to those who walk the midnight hours seeking rest that will not come. There are those who study these afflictions, cataloging them in neat rows like bones in an archaeologist's tent, sorting them into categories they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that taste of dust and academia.\n\nThe sleepless ones. They carry their burden like a cross, dragging it through days that blur into nights that refuse to yield their peace. Primary Insomnia they call it, when sleep becomes a stranger for thirty nights or more. Its dark brother, Hypersomnia, drags its victims down into endless drowning sleep, while Narcolepsy strikes like a rattler, sudden and without mercy.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the terrible machinery of the brain, neurons fire their ancient signals. They speak in tongues of orexin, these messengers of wake and sleep. The scientists, they took their mice and watched these neurons dance. GABAB receptors, they said, like gatekeepers at the edge of consciousness. When they forced these gates open with their chemicals - baclofen they called it - sleep came like a flood. The mice slept, and in their sleep they carried secrets about our own darkness.\n\nBut the truth of sleep lies deeper than receptors and neurons. It runs in bloodlines, passes from father to son like eye color or the shape of hands. When these inherited gates are broken, sleep becomes a ghost, haunting but never touching, and the sleepless ones must drag themselves through their days like wounded animals. They sit in fluorescent-lit offices, stand at assembly lines, drive their children to school, all while carrying the weight of endless waking, their eyes burning like coals in the desert of consciousness.",
            "He'd been there two and a half years or thereabouts, counting time in semesters like notches on a gun. The campus stretched vast and unforgiving before him, a concrete wilderness where souls wandered lost between buildings old as sin and new as tomorrow's promise. That first year they'd put him in East Halls, far out on the eastern edge where civilization gave way to the stadium's hulking shadow. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever hell the Pennsylvania weather chose to unleash, and it was always choosing.\n\nAn old graduate, not much older than himself but carrying the wisdom of years past, spoke of times when East Halls stood alone in a sea of empty land, like an island of brick and mortar in an ocean of nothing. Now that emptiness had been filled with the bones of progress - sports fields and buildings rising like monoliths from the earth, the Creamery and health services among them, apartment complexes circling like vultures on the periphery. The campus grew like a living thing, devouring space, making distance an enemy to be conquered.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but the idea of it, the promise of freedom in two wheels and a chain. He'd heard tell of a friend who'd returned to cycling after years away, speaking of it like a man who'd found religion again. Bikes are great, the friend had said, the words carrying the weight of prophecy. For a time they weren't cool but they were always right, always true.\n\nHe lived off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bicycle had been an investment in survival. Thomas building loomed twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bike cut through time like a blade, reducing the journey to five minutes of pure velocity. Pollock Road lay between, a straight shot but treacherous, populated by wandering souls and metal beasts. Walking was for those with time to burn, and time was a currency he couldn't spare. Each day without the bike would cost him forty minutes, time multiplied across days and weeks until it became a burden too heavy to bear.",
            "They came for the machines and the money both. In the pages of his testament Huxley had seen it coming like a storm rolling across the plains of human consciousness, dark and vast and terrible. The people in his vision stood as cattle in their pens, branded with letters that marked their worth, their minds scrubbed clean of individual thought by the relentless whispers in the night. They called it conditioning. A word clean as bleached bone but beneath it lay something darker.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some pagan god of old, dispensing happiness like communion wafers, hollow and tasteless but necessary all the same. Through the lens of Marx's prophecies you could see the truth of it, written in the blood of human autonomy. Words like homogeny and reification rattled like dead men's teeth in the skull of progress.\n\nThe false consciousness lay upon them like a burial shroud. The lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, all of them marked and numbered like livestock - moved through their days in a soma-induced haze, buying and spending and rutting with mechanical precision. They knew nothing of their chains. The Alphas and Betas watched from their towers of privilege, knowing but not speaking, seeing but not acting. Bernard alone stood witness, though his testimony fell on ears stopped with cotton and comfort.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. The characters moved through their assigned roles like marionettes, strings pulled by unseen hands. The men spoke of women as if describing machinery - pneumatic, functional, interchangeable parts in the great engine of society. The women catalogued their couplings like accountants tallying figures in a ledger. Each caste accepted their place with the quiet resignation of the damned, consuming their allotted pleasures, obeying their prescribed commandments, walking in lockstep toward some horizon they could neither see nor understand.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The walls were white and clean like bones bleached in the desert sun. Men and women argued whether this faith carried violence in its heart. The question echoes still, louder now than before, like thunder rolling across empty plains.\n\nSince the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens changed their tune. First with venom and spite then with a sweetness that seemed false as a serpent's smile. Strange days these are when a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale sits heavy in my hands. Words that dont match the blood-soaked history I know. They tell of a gentle man but history whispers different truths. In the old stories he rode with sword and flame, making converts of the conquered. Yet here in these pages he walks humble and meek, waiting for men to find truth in his words like water in the desert.\n\nThe writers laid their words careful as trappers setting snares. They painted miracles that mirror the Christ's own works. Mutton and milk multiplied like loaves and fishes. A mockery. They stole the holy stories and dressed them in different clothes, thinking none would notice the theft.\n\nThey built their truth on whispers. One man telling another who told another still, like wind carrying dust across empty places. Each story passed through many mouths before finding paper, and truth has a way of changing shape when it travels so far.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they made him holy. Gentle. Wise. But history carries darker truths, written in blood and steel. I wonder if the faithful know what darkness sleeps in their prophet's past, what violence birthed their faith. Some truths are better left in shadow, but they have a way of finding light.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of time while the world spun on and men spoke of things they knew nothing about. The truth of it was simple enough. Christianity had wandered far from where it began, like some nomadic tribe lost in the wasteland, each generation straying further from the path until they forgot there ever was one.\n\nNow the world turns different. Progressive they call it. The old ones still cling to their ways like driftwood in a flood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak. There's a awakening coming. Like thunder rolling across the plains. People wanting to strip away the layers of doctrine built up like rust on iron, wanting to find what lies beneath. Might take years. Might take centuries. Don't matter none. It'll come just the same.\n\nThey'll peel back time like the skin of some ancient fruit. Layer by layer. Until there ain't nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about what God wanted. When it comes it'll sweep through like wildfire. Through the cities and the towns. Through the old world and the new. The church'll still stand but it'll be different. Like a house stripped down to its bones.\n\nWhere there was many there'll be one. Where there was difference there'll be sameness. It's happened before. Rome hunted Christians like wolves then bent its knee to the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up and up comes down.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading from some ledger but like reading smoke signals against the sky. Looking for meaning behind meaning.\n\nBack before all this there was only the Jews. Back when Rome first marched into Jerusalem like they owned it. Sixty-three years before the birth of Christ. The Jews weren't one people then neither. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. Common folk. All of them different as night and day but all reading from the same book. One God. One truth. One holy text. That's how it started.",
            "There aint no mercy in the hearts of men. The Jungle shows us this truth plain as day and black as night. Deep in their cores men harbor only greed and self-preservation, a darkness that spreads like poison through their veins. They look not below them save to crush what lies beneath their boots.\n\nYou see it clearest in them factory owners and their kind. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, caring nothing for the cost. Their ambitions rise like great black monoliths against the dying sky, and Sinclair writes of it thus: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries with it the dreams and lives of thousands, drifting off into nothingness while the masters count their coins.\n\nThese men care nothing for the destruction they wrought. Not for the poisoned earth nor the fouled waters running thick with offal from their killing floors. The air itself turned rank with the stench of progress, and still they pushed on, driven by that ancient hunger that knows no satisfaction.\n\nTheir workers was nothing more than cattle to them. Expendable. Replaceable. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair called it, where \"no man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till his bones cracked then cast him aside like a spent shell casing, no more thought given than to the hogs they butchered.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown knew no salvation. No law protected them, no angel watched over their suffering. The unions that claimed to be their salvation was nothing but vultures picking at the same corpse. They was slaves in all but name, bound not by chains but by poverty and desperation. \"Here is a population,\" the truth rings out, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" And so it was, and so it remains, the dark heart of man beating its terrible rhythm through the ages.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Like a father with his favorite child. In it he wrote of Thulé, that word appearing twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, and Mabbott in his wisdom traced it back to Virgil who spoke of some forsaken island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there was something else. Something closer. The German scribes had caught Poe's eye and held it.\n\nThe truth of it lay in how Poe knew Goethe's work, deep and terrible. Arndt, in his scholarly wanderings through Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, saw the ghost of one in the other, like a man recognizing his own reflection in muddy water.\n\nOxford tells us Goethe was a giant among men who birthed Faust into the world in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in 1832 when death finally claimed him. Hidden in that second part was \"The King of Thulé,\" a dark tale of a king whose queen passed leaving him naught but a goblet. He drank deep of his grief until the cup overflowed with tears and memory. When his time came he gave away all he owned save that cursed vessel. Walked to the edge of the world and cast it into the hungry sea before closing his eyes one final time. That king and the wraith in Dreamland might have been brothers, both shaped by loss and drink and darkness.\n\nGrattan took Faust and made it his own in 1842, not a year before Poe wrote of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Like blood calling to blood. Twice Poe conjured Thule in his writings, once in Pendulum and twice more in Dreamland like bookends holding up worlds of shadow. Read them together, Goethe's King and Poe's Dreamland, and you'll see the same darkness reflected. The speaker walks through places where color goes to die, where ghosts of dead friends whisper on the wind, where loneliness has made its kingdom. Just as Goethe's king walked through his own private hell after his queen's passing.\n\nPoe knew Goethe as sure as night knows day, if only through Tennyson whom he praised like a prophet. But there were other ways Goethe's words might have found him, carried on the winds of countless retellings after the master's death.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than any statute writ by men in their towers of concrete and steel. In the florescent-lit aisles of D&D Markets the applesauce spread like some viscous harbinger, a portent of what was to come while Martin sat in his office eating his dinner with the same methodical indifference that marked all his days.\n\nThey had told him twice. Wayne first and then Haddigan quarter hour later, their voices carrying the same warning through the stale store air but Martin had dismissed them both with words that hung like lead in the empty space between them. Didn't have time for customer complaints, he'd said, though time was all there was and all there ever would be.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if the world had been waiting for just such a moment. Her body twisted and broke against the hard tile floor like something preordained, her spine crackling with a sound like dry kindling. The fifth such falling that year, or perhaps the sixth, as if the store itself had developed a taste for broken bodies and spilled blood.\n\nThe question before the court was one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether Martin's disregard carried within it that special kind of darkness the law calls malice. The California code spoke of oppression and fraud and malice like ancient runes carved in legal stone, demanding proof of despicable conduct or willing disregard for the safety of others. And there was something in Martin's actions that spoke to this, something in the way he sat eating while knowing what lay in wait in his aisles, knowing what had come before and what would surely come again.\n\nThe judge would see it. In the cold fluorescent light of the courtroom he would recognize that special kind of darkness that lives in men who watch others suffer while they sup, who hear warnings and turn away, who know the consequences and choose them anyway. For this was not mere negligence but something older, something that spoke to the darkness that lives in all men's hearts.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a hunger. Started when she was fourteen and hadnt left her yet. Three years gone and still it gnawed. Not a thing she needed now but someone and yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They made their clumsy advances like yearling colts testing weak legs but she turned from them all. She studied this emptiness like a crow picking through bones but found no answers there. Just the endless wanting and the questions that followed behind like pallbearers at a funeral that wouldnt end.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through the rooms like ghosts barely disturbing the air. No shouting. No tears. When words did rise between them and their daughter they were about her wildness, her need to run free like some unbroken mare. She carried a fire in her that burned bright against their stillness but folk took to her anyway. Something in that flame drew them close despite the risk of burning.\n\nThen came the day when quiet broke. A cry cut through the morning air sharp as a blade. Kitchen way. Her mothers voice twisted into something wrong. She ran calling out mama mama but the only answer was pain wrapped in short breaths. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something fallen from a great height. Touch gentle as prayer on her mothers shoulder. Take me to the hospital child the words coming broken and scattered like birds shot from the sky. She gathered her mother up blessed now for the strength in her arms. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air was thick with death and antiseptic but she noticed none of it. Her world had narrowed to her mothers pain and the need to end it. Called out and white coats came running their faces masks of concern. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left her there in the waiting room with nothing but time and worry for company.\n\nAll this because a vase set too high needed reaching and a stepstool proved treacherous as any snake in the garden.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not in words but in the absence of dead hearts, in the flowing of clean blood through untainted vessels. They called it aMed, this scoring of meals, this counting of plants and fish and the oils that men had pressed from fruit since time before memory.\n\nThe old studies spoke their piece. Numbers carved into ledgers showing how men who ate from the earth's abundance, who shunned the heavy fats of beasts, lived longer. Their hearts beat stronger. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that silent killer that steals mind and movement alike.\n\nSeventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women they watched. Nurses all of them, scattered across eleven states like seeds in the wind. For twenty years they marked their eating in questionnaires, six times from 1984 to 2004, documenting each morsel as if writing their own salvation. They were faithful in their reporting, these women, more than ninety-five in every hundred staying true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they searched through papers and certificates, autopsy reports telling tales of failed hearts and blocked vessels. Some they called probable, when the papers weren't there to tell the tale. Seventeen percent of strokes, twenty-four percent of heart failures, marked down in their ledgers like notches on a gun.\n\nThey tracked everything. Weight and smoke and pills. The movement of bodies in leisure and the changes that time brings to women's flesh. The numbers spoke of protection. Those who followed the old ways, eating as their ancestors did from the Mediterranean shores, they lived longer. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke, one thousand seventy-seven souls claimed by the combined assault. But those who ate from the earth's bounty, they stood stronger. The numbers said so. Zero point seven one, they wrote in their books. A mathematical blessing, a ward against death.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign said. Just that and nothing more upon the cardboard held aloft by the girl actor who'd once played pregnant in that picture show. She stood there in the gray morning like some soothsayer of old bearing portents and auguries.\n\nThey called it Burma though that wasnt its name no more. A land of temples and soldiers where men in ochre robes walked the streets in silence until they didnt. Until the streets ran red with their blood and the monasteries lay broken and burning in the perpetual dusk of that strange country. The government men had come up through ranks like carrion birds ascending, nineteen sixty two it was, and they ruled with iron and lead and all manner of cruelty that men devise when power fills their gullets.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Saffron Revolution they called it though revolution it wasnt, just death dealt out like playing cards in some cosmic game where the house always wins. A Japanese man with a camera lay dying in the street while they watched. Thirteen dead said the papers but the colonel who fled knew different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nThese things aint new. Since men first gathered in tribes there been those who'd rule absolute. Roman emperors who claimed kinship with gods. Japanese kings who were gods themselves. Even now our own president takes counsel from prophets and madmen who speak in tongues of power and control.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. Tiananmen where tanks rolled over students who dared to dream. Rwanda where neighbor killed neighbor until the streets stank of death. Hitler's own Reich where the crematoriums burned day and night without ceasing. All of it written in blood on pages that history turns with indifferent hands.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms long across the wasteland of jazz, not just in years but in the way he shaped and molded his orchestra like some dark craftsman at his forge. His piano work whispers through the compositions like wind through dead grass, but as architect of sound he built cathedrals of brass and wood where soloists could wander like prophets in the wilderness. He knew the voices of his men, knew them like a father knows his sons, and he wrote for their souls as much as their instruments. The framework he built was both prison and liberation, the tightly wound phrases and loose improvisations existing in the same space like light and dark at twilight.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of ancient scripture, noting how he made the human voice into something otherworldly, stripped of words and meaning save what the soul could conjure. Six times the piece turns upon itself like a serpent consuming its tail. First comes the voice, pure as spring water then rough as desert stone, calling to the reeds that answer like lost children. Then the trumpet emerges from the darkness, muted and blue as midnight, followed by the clarinet that climbs toward heaven while the piano walks beneath it like a shadow. The full band rises up like a great beast, brass and reed speaking in tongues, until the fifth turning when everything reaches toward something unseen and terrible and beautiful. In the end the voice returns, growling like some creature that has forgotten it was once human, and the trombone speaks the final dissonant words like a priest delivering last rites.\n\nA year later he conjured Hot and Bothered from the void, Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice speaking to each other like lovers in a dead language. And when It Don't Mean a Thing emerged from the darkness, Nanton's trombone spoke first, as if announcing the coming of something that could not be named. This was Ellington's way, to take the human and make it instrument, to take the brass and make it flesh, until you could no longer tell where one ended and the other began.",
            "They come to us like questions in the dark. How the beasts of field and forest take their shapes and why. What forces bind them to their forms like prisoners to their chains. In 1917 Thompson wrote of how even the learned men of science had not yet begun to speak of living things in the tongue of numbers and equations and even now his words ring true across the wasteland of years.\n\nThe shells lie before us like calcified histories. Each one a testament to some ancient geometry that we cannot name. We study them, these remnants of Prunum, these spiral tombs of the creatures that once dwelt within. We gather their ghosts through machines that peer through their walls with invisible light and we feed these spectral measurements to newer machines that speak in electricity and silicon.\n\nThe shell is a prison built by its inmate, constructed in slow circles through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of eternal return. The whorls spiral like a rope around nothing, around an axis that exists only in theory, in the mind. The columella stands sentinel at the center of it all. Each revolution grows according to some mathematical truth that we can only glimpse, like seeing shapes in smoke. The sutures mark time like notches on a prisoner's wall.\n\nWe arrange them in our taxonomies. Apical. Basal. Apertural. Abapertural. Words we use to impose order on chaos. We count the whorls like counting rings in a tree, measuring quarter turns as if such precision matters in the face of geological time. The aperture traces its path through space like a bullet through the dark, leaving behind only its calcified wake.\n\nIn the end we reduce it all to numbers. Coordinates. Trajectories. As if we could capture the essence of life in equations. As if we could understand the mind of God through mathematics. But the shells remain what they are. Silent witnesses to processes we can only pretend to comprehend.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like dark seeds in the earth, their numbers unchanging through the years, a grim testament carved in stone. The nation moved forward in some ways, meeting goals for water and clean places to shit, but the mothers and their young ones kept dying just the same, their blood seeping into soil that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey said more births now had someone who knew the old ways, seven of ten maybe, women who'd learned their craft from their mothers and grandmothers before them. But when the blood came, really came, these women stood helpless as the rest, watching life drain away in crimson rivers. Numbers on paper meant nothing to death. It took what it wanted.\n\nIn the cities they cut women open to save them, but not many. Four in hundred maybe. Out in the places where dirt roads turned to mud and electricity came and went like a fickle god, fewer still. The rich got their medicine and their doctors. The poor got their prayers. Twenty-seven percent difference between them, the bureaucrats said, as if poverty could be measured in clean decimals instead of dead children.\n\nThey argued about it in offices with air conditioning, whether to build special programs or fix the whole broken machine. Vertical approaches, they called them, like ladders to heaven. But every ladder they built seemed to steal from another, and the forms and papers multiplied like rats in a granary. Money flowed to AIDS while babies died of diarrhea, and the doctors chased the dollars like crows following a plow. Nothing changed except the numbers on the reports, and those numbers were written in blood.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, spreading like windblown seed across the land until no man could count its varieties. And these varieties bred new varieties and those bred still more until the names themselves became a babel of confusion. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning children darker and stranger than their fathers.\n\nAmong these bastard sons none grew more twisted and manifold than the thing they called Heavy Metal. It came slouching out of the darkness forty years ago and in its wake followed legions. Each new breed carrying some mark of its sire but warped and changed like creatures born in atomic fire. The darkness in it spoke to something in men's souls and they took it and shaped it to their own designs, each new shaping breeding yet more shapes until the very thing that spawned them all became impossible to name.\n\nNow the metal walks among us in countless forms, like some demon that can wear any face it chooses. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, back to the source of the darkness. For metal aint just music. It's a movement born in shadow and raised on blood and thunder.\n\nThey made it louder, heavier, more violent than what came before. The players were virtuosos of chaos, their instruments howling like the damned. And there were drugs, yes. In those mid-seventies years when the psychedelics flowed like water and men's minds turned to strange horizons. They made records that sound like dispatches from hell itself, blame it on the drugs if you want but the darkness was there already, waiting. The pretty music of those days couldn't speak to what was coming. But metal could. Metal did. Like some dark reflection of the Romantic composers of old, it reached into the shadows of men's souls and pulled forth something terrible and true.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of something ancient and terrible. The Dream they called it. Nineteen hundred and ten. A woman lost in some savage paradise while beasts with eyes like burning coals watched from the darkness of the jungle. But the real dream was his own and it gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition. Acceptance. The approval of men who painted in ways he could not understand but desperately wished to join.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard against the slate roofs and the streets ran with mud. No teacher ever showed him how to hold a brush or mix colors or capture the light that fell across the world like God's own thoughts. For forty years he collected tolls from travelers while the art lived inside him like some trapped animal trying to claw its way free. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. His first wife Clémence died and took eight babies with her to the cold ground leaving only Julia behind. The grief sat in him like lead and he turned to painting like a man turns to whiskey, hoping to drown something that cannot be drowned.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. While Matisse and the others carved their names into history with wild colors and shapes that defied God's own design Rousseau labored in his simple way trying to make pictures that would please the men who decided such things. Matisse feared convention like it was a poison but Rousseau sought it like salvation. Two men walking different roads in the same dark wood. One running from what the other was running toward.\n\nThe folk painters heart beat in him true as any clock. He painted what he knew and what he dreamed and what he feared all at once and the pictures came out strange and wonderful though he never meant them to be. His dreams of acceptance lay in him like stones but the pictures that came from his hands were something else entirely. Something wild. Something true.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road. Been that way since before any living soul drew breath. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, beauty being truth and truth being all we need know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but the knowing of right and wrong, the seeing of what's beautiful, that comes from somewhere deeper. Like an old well that ain't got no bottom.\n\nYou can study it all you want. Write down rules about what makes something right or pretty. But they're just words on paper, trying to catch smoke in your hands. Take that painting, the Mona Lisa. Folk talk about shadow and light, about what was happening in Italy back then, but that ain't really it. When someone loves a thing, really loves it, first words out their mouth is always something like \"there's just something about it.\" Rest comes after, like trying to explain why you love your momma.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things can only be told in stories because regular talk won't do. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who ain't never drunk none. Same goes for knowing right from wrong. Wittgenstein said ethics can't be spoke of proper, and he wasn't wrong. There's something in both art and right living that sits beyond words, like a far-off mountain you can see but never reach.\n\nWay I figure it, that's why stories and morals run so close together, like two streams joining in the valley. They both hit us somewhere deep, somewhere we can feel but can't point to. Literature especially. McKean had it right when he said books carry moral weight same as life does. Can't live without choosing between right and wrong, and can't tell stories without doing the same. That's what makes them matter. That's what makes them true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like a sentinel, unified and stark against the heavens, its essence flowing from the shadow-kept valleys of München where the alps loom black and ancient to the cold waters of Kiel where the Baltic meets the shore in eternal conflict. This essence, this blood-memory, courses through the veins of cities from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep and merciless, through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe winds like a steel serpent through Saxon stone. And in this land where darkness and light wage their endless war, the roots run deep into soil watered by the blood of tribes long forgotten.\n\nGermania. The word itself carries weight like old bones in the earth. Men argue its meaning like crows fighting over carrion, each pecking at truth with black beaks. Tacitus, that Roman who peered into the darkness beyond the empire's reach, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with fire and steel, becoming Germans in the crossing. Caesar too marked them in his writings, ink flowing like blood across parchment as he recorded their raids, their savage dance across borders that meant nothing to them. The word itself perhaps meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls, or maybe it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, death-dealer in the hands of warriors. Or perhaps it rose from garim, a scream in the Old Irish night, for these were a people who made the darkness echo with their war-cries.\n\nTacitus wrote of them as if writing of wolves or winter storms, creatures born of the land itself. Not mixed with others, he said, for who would choose such wilderness, such brutal skies, such a land that wore its hostility like a crown? The Germans were aboriginal, sprung from soil and ice and darkness.\n\nThe Romans came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry, leading their legions into the depths of Germania only to retreat again to their marble cities and heated baths. And the Germans remained, trading with the empire that feared them, serving in its armies while keeping their own savage hearts. They dwelt in the borderlands like shadows at the edge of firelight, taking what they needed from the land and from Rome itself, patient as winter, eternal as the forests that bore them.",
            "In the dark heart of Twelfth Night there dwells a truth about masks and the wearing of them, how they serve their purpose like a knife serves its wielder but in time will turn against the flesh that holds them. The shedding of such guises becomes necessary lest the wearer lose themselves to the void that lies between what is and what seems to be. But there aint no easy way to cast off what's become a second skin and them that's been deceived may turn cold as winter stone or hot as desert fury when the truth comes calling.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own peculiar burden, like a snake that eats its own tail, forever asking why. Why does the soul seek to shed its given form and take up another? Viola speaks plain enough about it: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nShe come to these foreign shores alone and afraid and took up man's clothing like armor against the world's malice. But such protection carries its own poison. It sets her apart from her own kind, leaves her to walk alone among women who might have been sisters to her. And Olivia, God help her, sees in Viola's disguise what she wants to see, calling out \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead birds from her lips. And there's Orsino too, speaking words that cut like broken glass: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nMaybe them that read these words now might see something deeper, like looking into a well at midnight. Maybe they'd say this tale shows how lies can sometimes midwife truth into the world, especially in Olivia and Orsino's case. Their desires lay buried like bones in the desert until Viola's deception dug them up. Some might wonder if Olivia's heart truly yearned for women all along, but that aint likely what Shakespeare meant. More like he was mocking them that judge love by its container rather than its contents.\n\nYou can see it clear as day when Olivia turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a rattler strikes, and speaks to Viola like blood kin: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words ring true at last, like a bell in the darkness that finally finds its proper tone.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in whispers. Of cruelties visited upon the Ovaherero and the Nama peoples in that sunscorched land they called South West Africa. But empires aint built on simple tales and the Germans ruled different lands different ways and some flourished while others withered beneath the weight of their governance.\n\nIn the east where the British come to rule in 1919 they found natives who could read and write and cipher numbers like educated men. Same in Kamerun where even the white men spoke well of what the Germans had done. But South West Africa was different. Something darker there.\n\nThe missionaries come with their books and their crosses but the government gave them nothing. No help. No coin. While the white children got their schools built fine with government money and the mission schools for whites got what they needed too. These things cast long shadows and while other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their way in the white man's world South West Africa remained in darkness. Its people untouched. Unlearned. Unable to read the very papers that marked their fate.\n\nMen wrote about these things. German men mostly, in the early days of the century, putting down in their own tongue what they saw in these far places. Later others come. English speakers who looked at how different colonies fared different fates. Cohen was one. He wrote about the schools in South West Africa and East Africa both, trying to make sense of why one flourished while the other failed. He said it was the settlers that made the difference. Too many whites in South West Africa wanting to keep things their way.\n\nThe land there wasnt like the other colonies. Not so hot. Not so wet. Desert mostly but liveable if you were white and determined. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had made it their home while East Africa, the next most settled place, had barely five thousand. They come for the temperate air and the promise of mastery over the land and its people. And master it they did.",
            "They rode forth across that contested earth, these two nations, like ancient enemies bound by blood and soil. From 1836 to 1893 they circled each other like wounded wolves, fifty-seven years of malice carved into the very ground beneath them. The war came in 1846, as wars do, and the American forces descended upon Mexico like locusts, stripping away Texas and the Southwest territories, leaving behind nothing but dust and memory.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all neighbors cursed by proximity they found in each other a mirror of their own fears, their own hatreds. Their differences ran deep as burial grounds - God and custom and the old ways setting them apart like oil and water in a jar. Cuba too stood watching from across the water, another thorn in the American flesh, while the rest of Latin America kept its distance, wise perhaps in its caution.\n\nReligion lay between them like a rusted blade. The Protestant Americans carried their prejudices from the old world, wearing their distrust of Catholics like armor, just as their English forebears had done. The Spanish shadow fell long across Mexico, and in its darkness old hatred grew like weeds in untended fields.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those bitter years, mostly over the border that cut through the land like a scar. Bandits and murderers moved across it like ghosts, striking at towns on both sides, until finally both nations sent their armies to stand watch over that invisible line. The rivalry died slow, like all ancient things must die, when Mexico fell into the economic embrace of its northern neighbor, American ambition turning from land to money, as it always does in the end.\n\nThe old ways changed. The old blood dried. But the memory remained, etched into the stones and the sand and the bones of all those who died in that time when two nations stared across a line drawn in dust, each seeing in the other a darkness they feared in themselves.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before it took me.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some hollow need for safety, the kind that gets bred into you when you're young and afraid. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always be dying or trying not to. So I buried deeper things, dreams of science and truth-telling, and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThere I was at forty-six. Alone. No money to speak of and work become impossible as breath to a hanged man. Fifteen years living on government alms and now nothing remains that's truly mine. Each day comes like a thief in the night, stealing what little security remains. Nothing certain anymore except this one truth: that without my blood kin and the few true friends, I'd have been gone to dust. When the real darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense of strength.\n\nLife's got its catastrophes waiting, big and small like wolves in the night. No matter how you prepare some storms are too big to weather alone. Ain't no guarantee written in stone or sky.\n\nThe government's basket's got holes and the bottom's falling out, sure as sunrise. But better we learn to trust each other again than each man digging his own grave in the backyard calling it shelter. They talk about rugged individualism like it built this nation, but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing was mercy and respect and the sharing of what little they had. Them wagon trains didn't cross the mountains one by one.\n\nSo lay in your stores. Keep your matches dry and your water clean. Stack your canned goods like gold bars if you want. Plant your garden if the earth'll have you. But while you're doing all that surviving, remember your neighbor's light in the window. Might be the only thing between you and the dark when it comes.",
            "He was born a prince in the old world, in times when men still believed the earth was flat and the heavens hung low like a tapestry of black velvet studded with cold fire. They would later call him Buddha. The years counted backward twenty five hundred times since then, since he walked away from wealth and crown to seek what lay beyond the veil of human suffering. What he found became Buddhism and the Theravada followed, pure as mountain water, orthodox as stone.\n\nThe thing that was then aint the thing that is now. In Sri Lanka they cut water once each year, monks and common folk gathered like dark birds at the edge of sacred pools, performing rituals the Buddha never spoke of. Time changes all things. Even truth. Even doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist folk, them that wear robes and them that dont, have watched their beliefs shift like sand in desert winds, pushed by forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all but bringing change regardless.\n\nWords matter here. Internal is what comes from inside the Buddhasasana, be it monk or layman that brings it. External is all else, the outsider, the stranger, the other. Some forces come with teeth bared and claws extended, seeking to tear down what Buddha built. These are hostile. Others come blank-faced and indifferent, neither meaning good nor ill, though they may bring either. These are benign. Remember these words. They'll come again.\n\nThe heart of it all beats steady beneath. Three jewels they seek refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient words. Suttas telling tales and teachings. Vinaya speaking law. Abhidhamma reaching into the spaces between spaces where metaphysics dwell. They speak of Anatta, the great emptiness where soul should be. Of Dukkha, the suffering that runs through all things like dark threads through pale cloth. Of Anicca, how nothing lasts, nothing stays, nothing holds. Know these and you might break free of Sansara, that wheel that turns and turns, grinding life into death into life again. Break free of want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya tells how to live. Five rules for common folk: kill not, lie not, steal not, keep your loins in check, stay clear of drink and drugs that cloud the mind. Monks got more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all stand four truths like stone pillars holding up the sky. Life is suffering. Want brings suffering. Suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",

Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.

The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

It moves like smoke through the fingers of them that try to grasp it, defined more by its absence than its presence, like the shadow of a bird across the desert floor. They say you can mark a culture by its traits but that aint true neither. No more than you can mark a man by the color of his eyes or the way he holds his knife at supper.\n\nThe old ones who say all Russians is stubborn or all Japanese bend like reeds in the wind, they dont know. They aint never set across from them at a table with papers spread out like the bones of dead things, watching and waiting. A man who aims to deal with folk from other places best know how their ways shape the words they speak and the silences between them. When you walk in foreign lands you carry your own land with you like a mirror, showing you what's different and what's the same.\n\nTo know another peoples ways you got to study their dead and their living both. Their wars and their peace. Their gods and their devils. Aint no point in trying to change what time and blood have written. You got to work within the walls they built, specially when you come as a stranger to their gates with your hat in your hand. And if youre standing on their ground you best honor their ways lest you find yourself talking to empty chairs.\n\nThem corporate folks got their own tribes too, each office tower like a different nation. Some wear their suits like armor and count their hours like misers count gold. Others let their people come and go like wild horses, so long as the work gets done. You can read their laws in the clothes they wear and the words they speak or dont speak. Even in one company the tribes differ, from city to prairie, from mountain to sea.\n\nValues run deeper than a river in flood. If a man's people believe in keeping face like keeping breath, he aint gonna shame himself or his kin just to win some paper victory. And them that believe in fighting tooth and nail for every scrap, they aint gonna lay down their arms at the first sign of peace. Best know these things before you sit at their table. But knowing a man's culture aint the same as knowing the man. That's a different kind of knowledge altogether, earned one word and one silence at a time.",
            "They say the fool speaks godlessness in his heart and these words echo through time from ancient psalms to the writings of the old saint Anselm and beyond. Dark words writ in darker times. And Aquinas too carried this torch through the medieval night though neither man could fully illuminate the vastness they sought to explain.\n\nThe God they pursued was not some nameless force moving through creation like wind through dead grass but the very God of scripture, terrible and magnificent. To speak of other gods would be to speak of nothing at all. Nothing at all.\n\nAnselm walked the inward path. Said that God dwelt in understanding itself and that the very thought of God proved his existence like a fingerprint pressed into the clay of consciousness. As if the mind itself was testament enough. As if faith could birth certainty from the womb of doubt.\n\nBut Aquinas. He walked different ground. Believed that God could be found in the bones of the world itself, in the mechanism of change and cause, in the very architecture of being. Five paths he carved through the wilderness of reason. Each one leading to the same destination like trails converging at a mountain peak none had seen but all knew must exist.\n\nHe spoke of change and how it moved through all things like blood through veins, spoke of causes stretching back through time like links in an infinite chain, of contingency and excellence and the terrible harmony that bound all things together in their proper place. As if the universe itself was a vast puzzle with one piece removed, and in that absence was proof of presence.\n\nBut neither man's words could capture the whole of it. Like trying to catch sunlight in a jar or hold back the tide with your hands. Their arguments stood like weathered stones in an ancient field, marking something that was there but could never fully be measured or known.",
            "Words carry weight and writers know this truth deep in their bones like ancient hunters knew the patterns of prey. They wield their tools like weapons, some sharper than others, some deadlier in their purpose. Fitzgerald, he knew these tools well. In that book of his, The Great Gatsby, he worked his craft with a precision that would make a surgeon weep. He'd take words that had no business being together and force them to dance, make them tell stories they weren't meant to tell. But it was in the colors where his real power lay, like some old medicine man mixing his paints. Gold and green and white and gray and that damned pink-red that bleeds through the pages like a wound that won't heal.\n\nThe white and gray, they speak of sameness, of the crushing weight of uniformity that presses down on all things. White for the rich folks with their starched collars and manufactured smiles, gray for the used-up and worn-down. They're everywhere in his pages, these colors, like ghosts that won't rest. Daisy and Jordan floating through scenes in their white dresses like pale phantoms. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, all of them wearing their whiteness like armor against the dark. Even Catherine, powdered white as death itself, like some carnival mask that can't hide what's beneath.\n\nThe city rises up in white canyons, vast and empty as bleached bones in the desert sun. The names of party-goers fade to gray like old newspapers left in the rain. Apartment buildings stack up like slices of some monstrous white cake that no one wants to eat. The whole world turned to white and gray, like God himself ran out of colors and had to make do.\n\nAnd then there's Daisy, poor doomed Daisy in her white dress and white car, moving through the story like a ghost that doesn't know it's dead. Fitzgerald paints her with these colors deliberate-like, showing us what she really is - just another piece in the great machine of sameness, something for Gatsby to chase after like a man chasing his own shadow. She wears that gray fur collar like a noose, and when she appears again in white before the final showdown, it's like watching a funeral procession where the corpse doesn't know it's supposed to lie down.",
            "The land lay golden and quiet beneath the California sun, stretching out across San Diego County like some ancient promise made flesh. Here the soil yielded its bounty year after year, the earth giving forth tomatoes and citrus and greens in endless procession, while squash grew fat and yellow in their beds and broccoli stood like tiny forests in perfect rows. The trees bore peaches and lemons and the bees made their honey and all manner of pepper grew red and angry in the endless summer light.\n\nThey called it organic farming now, though it was just farming as it had always been before the world grew modern and cruel. People waited in long lines to claim their share of eggs still warm from the hen and milk pure as scripture. The farmers opened their gates to the townfolk who came to walk the land and watch the birds wheel overhead in their ancient patterns, as if nothing in the world had changed since time began.\n\nThe land itself was one hundred and sixty acres that pressed against the Cleveland National Forest like a supplicant. Chaparral and grassland brought over by long-dead settlers from across the sea, and oak woodland that had stood sentinel since before any man walked these hills. Here lived creatures whose names read like a litany of the dying: the kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog and the gnatcatcher, all of them fading like old photographs in the merciless march of progress.\n\nThe Indians had walked here first, their footsteps lost to time, and after them came the ranchers with their cattle and the woodcutters with their saws, all of them taking what they could from the land until nothing remained but dust and memory. The earth remembered though, in the way that all things remember their wounds, and now men sought to heal it with their careful tending and their programs and their papers filled with promises.\n\nBut the land cared nothing for promises. It demanded sweat and blood and endless labor, the breaking of backs and the callousing of hands. Without the poisons that other men used, the farmer must wage constant war against weed and pest, must nurse the soil like a sick child, must accept that some battles would be lost to nature's indifferent eye.

When the world turns black as pitch and hope dies that bond shows its true nature whether it be good or evil and there aint no going back from what gets revealed.\n\nThe price is always high. Always was and always will be. Understanding what flows between brothers means carrying the weight of what comes after. When you look into your brothers eyes and see yourself staring back you dont see what others see. You see the truth of what you are. Raw and real as hunger. Your deeds and their aftermath show what manner of creature you truly are.\n\nIn The Scarlet Ibis two brothers walk this path like so many before them. Through swamps thick with cypress and spanish moss where the air hangs heavy as wet wool they make their way on a fools errand. Pride crashes against disappointment like thunder against the hills and when the storm passes only one brother draws breath. We see it all through the eyes of the older brother who carries his own darkness. His view of the world around him black as pitch and twice as thick shapes everything he does.\n\nPride sits in his heart like a poison. From the first time he takes his crippled brother Doodle out into the world to their last terrible journey together he carries that poison inside him. He wanted a brother to teach the things he knew. To hold his breath underwater. To run. To climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted someone to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with him in the highest branches of the pine behind the barn. But Doodle with his weak heart wasnt meant for such things. The doctors said he might not even live and if he did hed never be strong enough for what his brother dreamed. The older boy even thought about smothering Doodle with a pillow like you might do to some suffering animal.

Then the shape emerges from darkness, but the mind already knows what it seeks. It hunts for boxes in the void, finding them before they fully form.\n\nAttention sits like a gatekeeper at the crossroads of thought, deciding what passes and what dies in the dark. The grass beneath your boots contains multitudes, but the mind lets them fade like morning mist. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room cuts through the chaos like a knife. The mind decides what matters and what don't, and it decides again and again until the deciding becomes truth.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments. Some fresh as morning dew, others buried deep in the loam of years.

Men who had built empires of paper watched them burn. The unemployed walked the streets like ghosts. Houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in years prior, when men in suits whose souls had long since been traded for power decided that everyone should own a piece of the American dream, whether they could afford it or not.

The numbers stand stark in the chart below like cattle bones bleaching in the sun.\n\nThe figures tell a tale plain as day - a portfolio of just them top holdings runs 6.11 percent higher than the ETF itself, like a horse outrunning its shadow by sixteen percent. The Beta runs lower too, by point twelve. These numbers whisper that maybe them ten holdings alone might bring more reward with less risk. But numbers can lie like men can lie, and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just tricks of the light.",
            "The numbers fell like winter birds shot from the sky, there in the third month. You could see it plain in Figure 17, the way the logs dwindled and died. No man could say why for certain though theories stalked the margins of understanding like hungry wolves. Winter had come as it always did to New England, merciless and raw, driving the bicycle riders and walkers from the roads. December too brought its own peculiar madness - the rush of endings, of grades to be counted like cattle bones, of work piled high like cordwood before the storm. The commuter logs became ghosts, forgotten things.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud. Campus emptied, halls echoing with absence, parking lots barren as dead lakes. When January crawled back with its ice-teeth and iron sky, bringing students and teachers alike, the numbers stayed low, huddled against the cold. February offered no answers, just silence and snow.\n\nSome said it was natural, the way all things burn bright then fade. Like a fire dying to embers. We fought back with what weapons we had - the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate rally against the darkness. It worked some. The logs rose like smoke signals but the truth remained: the academic calendar was a beast that devoured momentum, swallowing whole months in its endless cycle of beginnings and endings.\n\nBut there was something deeper, something carved into the bone of American life itself. The car was freedom. Independence. A metal horse for the modern age. You could see it in their eyes when they gripped their steering wheels - that wild thing that wouldn't be tamed by coffee shop gift cards or restaurant vouchers. We gave these prizes like Indians trading beads, thinking they meant something. Maybe if we'd offered bigger game - sleek bicycles or those hybrid cars with their quiet engines, or even one of them electric vehicles that hummed like summer insects - maybe then we'd have seen different numbers in those cold months. Could have announced it like prophets: December bringing bicycles, January bringing hybrid chariots. Might have kept them believing, kept them logging their miles like pilgrims counting rosary beads. But we'll never know. Some questions don't have answers, just theories that circle like crows over a battlefield.",
            "I set to wandering through the old Edison reels laid up in the Library of Congress like ancient scrolls in some forbidden archive. Fifteen of them there were, dating from 1895 to 1901, each one a trick film meant to deceive the eye and mind both. They were crafted in ways that would make a man question what was real and what wasnt real and perhaps if there was any difference between the two at all.\n\nThe films stood like sentinels against time itself. Bound to their sets like prisoners to stakes, they peered out through a proscenium arch that knew neither movement nor mercy. The camera stood fixed and distant as God himself, watching through long shots and medium shots but never daring closer, as if some unwritten commandment had been laid down in the early days of moving pictures.\n\nIn those flickering images you could see the ghost of vaudeville haunting every frame. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, sliding sideways across the stage as if afraid to approach the eye that watched them. Take that peculiar piece they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and his fellow specters dance their sideways waltz, entering stage right like souls crossing the River Styx, but never advancing toward that glass eye that captured their movements for all time.\n\nThe rules of this new world were strict and unforgiving as desert law. One shot was one film, no more and no less, though sometimes the magicians behind the lens would splice their celluloid together in secret ways to make spirits appear and vanish like smoke. These tales rarely stretched beyond a minute's length, brief as life itself sometimes seems, and simpler than the stories told round campfires since time began.\n\nWatch close The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895 and you might catch the sleight of hand where they switched the living queen for her manufactured double. The trick is there plain as day if you know where to look, like the truth hiding in plain sight. But in those days folks weren't looking for truth in moving pictures. They were looking for magic, and magic they found in those strange mechanical dreams projected on white sheets in darkened rooms.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a contradiction bleeding through time like a wound that won't heal. Some call it hollow, others praise its terrible beauty, but truth dont care much for what men call things. Horace Walpole, he took what was old and what was new and stitched them together like some nightmarish creature, breathing life into what we now call Gothic. The Castle of Otranto it was called. A Gothic Story, he named it, simple as that.\n\nMedieval ghosts dance through these pages, stone walls and ancient rites rising up like dead things from the earth. Gothic they called it then, Gothic they call it now, though the word means different things to different men in different times. Some saw it as primitive, backward even, standing against the march of progress like a stubborn mule. But the marriage of theatrical Gothic ways with the intimacy of novel writing, that union survived, transformed, became something else entirely. Something that could speak to souls across centuries.\n\nChivalry runs through it all like blood through veins. The medieval knight, that ancient ideal of honor and courage, haunts these pages like a restless spirit. Walpole saw something missing in his time, something lost that needed finding again. The world he knew was sick with politics and lies, and maybe he thought the old ways, the gothic ways, held some cure for what ailed society. You can see it clear as day in characters like Frederic, who stands like some fever dream of what a knight should be.\n\nThey wrote him as suffering nobility, a prince who'd walked through fire and come out changed. Said he'd been killed by infidels, though dead men dont usually walk back into stories. The gallant and courteous Knight, they called him, though even then the description dripped with excess like honey from a broken comb, sweet but somehow wrong.",
            "The chain moves like blood through veins, goods passing raw and unformed through the stages of their becoming until they reach the hands that called for them. Oliver had named it in '82, this dark procession of material and want, though the thing itself was ancient as commerce and trade and the first bartering of shells for meat. He'd written of it in terms clinical and stark, speaking of implementation and control and satisfaction but the truth of it lay deeper, in the bone-knowledge of need and the fulfilling of it.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. The managers move between these pillars like priests of some mercantile faith, conducting their rituals of efficiency and service.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone on which all else rests. It begins with knowing, with reading the auguries of the market like ancient seers reading entrails, seeking in the patterns of purchase and desire what must be brought forth into the world. The managers peer into these depths and from them draw forth numbers, quantities, locations. They choose their grounds like generals planning campaigns, selecting which fortress of industry will birth which goods, measuring volume against quality against the endless hunger of demand.\n\nThey map the work in ledgers and computer screens, scheduling the labors like the movements of armies. Each detail matters, each minute particular bearing the weight of consequence. A misstep here cascades through the chain like poison in a river. He'd seen it himself in the great retail houses, Walmart and Target, where every action from the folding of a shirt to the receiving of a truck followed patterns laid down like scripture in their manuals and guides.\n\nSupply comes next, the choosing of capabilities and alliances. Like a general dividing his forces, management must decide which battles each division will fight, what specialties each will claim. Sometimes they send work out beyond their walls, seeking velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility won at the altar of reduced cost.",
            "They came in their volumes from that old time, those books bound in leather and gilt, speaking of drawing rooms and tea services and the finery of men who wore topcoats and carried silver-headed canes. But there were others. Dark things. Books that crawled with nightmares and the blackness that dwells in men's souls. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart, wrought in shadow and bearing witness to mysteries that lay beneath the surface of proper society like corpses in shallow graves.\n\nIn them the darkness speaks. Dreams come unbidden and terrible. In Oliver's tale the boy walks between Sikes and Crackit, phantoms made real in his fever-addled mind, their voices echoing as if across vast canyons of time. Gunfire splits the night. Screams pierce the darkness. Lights dance like witchfire before his eyes while pain, constant as original sin, gnaws at his bones. Some hand, unseen and perhaps guided by providence or perhaps by darker forces, bears him away through this carnival of horrors.\n\nThe dreams speak truth in these tales. In Oliver's story they reveal the rotting underneath, the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting comes again in chapter twenty-eight it comes like judgment, like prophecy fulfilled. The boy relives it all, trapped in that moment between life and death while Sikes and Crackit hover over him like carrion birds. The pain is everywhere and nowhere, diffuse as morning fog, married now to fear rather than shock. Oliver drifts, powerless as a leaf in a river. Whatever will drove the bullet into his flesh, it was not his own. Here Fagin's poison has done its work, breaking something essential in the boy's soul, leaving him adrift in a world without mercy or meaning.\n\nTime itself bends and breaks. Day becomes night becomes day, all meaning lost in the terrible silence of darkness, in the fleeting hours that pass like shadows across the face of a dying moon.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Helping them with their studies and whatever troubles they had with their learning. English and reading being what I knew best. There was this boy Adrian, third or fourth grade he must have been, brought to me by one of the teachers on account of his troubles with reading. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters that should have come natural to him were foreign things and others he knew like old friends. He was Latino sure enough but spoke English clear as any native born child. We went on like that for a time until I saw his mother. \n\nI was watching some stragglers while the others had gone off somewhere when she came in. Not a word of English passed her lips. Just Spanish. My own Spanish being poor we managed somehow but that's when it hit me like judgment day. Adrian could read well enough but the English letters were strange creatures to him, different from what he knew at home.\n\nThis here is about the wall between languages in our schools, particularly in California where I am. Sometimes the wall aint as clear as we might think. Even children who speak English proper can find themselves lost in the reading of it like wanderers in some foreign land. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it. For Adrian the answer was simple enough. Show him the letters, teach him their sounds. But for those who barely know English at all the answer aint so clear.\n\nTheres no single path through this wilderness. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special English classes. None of these alone will do what needs doing. The answer lies in using them all together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching aint just good for Spanish speakers but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers though many fear it's a waste. If we made this the way of things instead of just sometimes doing it all would be better for it. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues. That aint realistic. But having helpers who know both languages, that's something we can do sure enough.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A thing vast and unknowable that dwells beyond the veil of comprehension. Some seek it in wooden pews and stained glass temples while others quest inward through the dark corridors of self. Many accept without question the ancient stories passed down like worn copper coins from parent to child. Others rage against these inheritances, these tales told in the night, proclaiming themselves sole arbiters of their universe. All of us wanderers in the dark, searching for that pale fire that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof, cigarette smoke rising like spectral fingers into the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. His clothes hung from him like a scarecrow's rags, his hair thin as corn silk. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such darkness? I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him did nothing but stretch his suffering like a wire pulled taut, vibrating with pain. I cursed whatever god might exist in that vast darkness. No prayers passed my lips in those long nights. If there was something out there listening it had turned away long ago, deaf to the suffering of men.\n\nI could not watch him die. Would not. The act of witnessing seemed a betrayal of all he had been in life. I knew him better than any of them. Knew he would not want his child to stand vigil at his ending. For three days I lay curled in my bed like some wounded animal, waiting for word of his passing.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline carried the flame of Republicanism in his heart like a torch in darkness. He worked the land with his hands and knew its ways, and from this knowing came his thoughts on freedom and the workings of men who would govern others. The soil was his teacher and his prophet both, and from it sprang forth all manner of opinion on how men should live and be ruled and what constituted right in this world.\n\nHe saw in this new country a thing that had never been, pristine and untouched by the old ways that plagued the minds of men across the water. Here lay virgin ground for self-governance, unsullied by ancient custom. The rights of man, he knew, were like links in an iron chain. Break one and the whole would fail, becoming nothing more than scattered metal in the dust. These rights stood beyond the reach of any government, sacred and inviolate.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts. He saw how in nature the strong preyed upon the weak and how the clever-cruel prospered while the righteous suffered. But civilization, he reckoned, must stand against such base inclinations.\n\nThe good and the evil in man existed like two wolves in the same woods, and Taylor believed any government worth its salt must account for both. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the earth yield its bounty, and kept the moneylenders at bay. But even the finest government would draw the greedy and the power-hungry like carrion birds to flesh. Self-interest, that eternal force, moved through all men like blood through veins. Only when it turned parasitic, feeding off the labor of others, did it become a thing of evil.\n\nTaylor stood with those who held the Constitution as writ, not to be bent or twisted by clever men with sharp tongues. The federal beast, he knew, must be kept small and lean, lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical in its appetites. But words alone were not enough - the spirit of the law's makers must be remembered, like an old testament passed down through generations. And above all else stood the Declaration, that sacred scroll that spoke of sovereign states bound together not in bondage but in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and in looking down he saw what lay there before him and what lay there was nothing he had asked for nor wanted nor sought. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding slow and methodical and mechanical in its purpose yet serving no greater end than the watching itself. Thoughts came and went like wraiths in the desert wind leaving no trace of their passing.\n\nHe remembered the artist and the book she'd told him to buy. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it lay all manner of instruction from the basic handling of pencil to the way the mind sees what it sees and makes of it what it will. The book spoke of frames and boundaries and how they could take the vast terrible wholeness of a thing and reduce it to something a man might comprehend. A kitchen becoming just a table becoming just a bowl of fruit sitting there patient and indifferent to the eye that beheld it.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No boundary to contain what lay before him in the porcelain bowl. Like some primitive artist working in shades of brown and waste and human leavings he stood sentinel over his unwanted canvas. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was different. This was base and real and wouldn't be contained by any artist's vision.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and in finding it gave purpose to the moment. Water rushed and swirled carrying bits and pieces to nowhere but the mass remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again with greater urgency but still it stayed, affixed to the bowl like some prehistoric creature frozen in amber.\n\nHe stood in his uniform, the green tie at his throat like a noose, feet planted wide on the tile floor of the Rite Aid bathroom. The toilet paper came away in sheets and he wrapped his hand in it like a man preparing for some grim surgery. Then bending at the waist he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into the bowels of the earth itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night stretches endless before them. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things. Not ready for the violence of speed and momentum and physics that care nothing for youth or dreams or promises made.\n\nInexperience stalks them like a predator in the dark. Rolls their machines like toys. Sends them careening off into ditches where they lay burning or bleeding or both. And they travel in packs these young ones. Always in packs. The way of their kind since time was time. Studies done in California show the truth of it. The more of them packed together the more of them die.\n\nThe state tries to control it with paper laws and curfews but these are just words written in ink that wash away in blood. Even at eighteen the hunger for danger lives in their bones like a parasite. Some doctor named Zuckerman he studied it. Wrote about how they chase the thrill of it like addicts chase the needle. And now more are coming. Children of the boomers. Millions of them. Ready to take the wheel.\n\nThey talk about fixing it. About schools teaching them and permits that say when they can drive and when they cant. Like you can control death with bureaucracy. Make it wait its turn. They want national laws now. As if the reaper cares about state lines. As if metal and momentum recognize borders drawn by men in offices far away.\n\nNone of this is new. The road has always taken its toll and always will. The young have always died on it and always will. That's the nature of speed and steel and youth. The nature of a world that don't care how many summers you've seen or how many you thought you had left to see.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though the name meant little to those afflicted. A darkness in the mind where sounds go to die or become twisted things unrecognizable from their original form. Not deafness no. The ears work as God intended but somewhere in the labyrinth of gray matter the meaning gets lost like a traveler in some vast desert with no landmarks to guide him home.\n\nThe disorder existed before men put a name to it. In the middle of the last century they began to study it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. They developed their tests and their methods while across the ocean Kimura worked on his own solutions like some medieval alchemist searching for gold in lead. In seventy-seven they gathered, these seekers of truth, to share what little they knew of this thing that lived in the minds of children.\n\nThe manifestations came like specters in the night. A man might hear perfectly well yet be unable to tell where the sound originated as if the world itself had become unmoored from direction and space. Words might blur together like watercolors in rain. Patterns of sound that made sense to others became meaningless rhythms without form or substance. The subtle shifts in human speech that carry meaning beyond the words themselves - these too could be lost leaving only hollow shells of communication behind.\n\nThey tested for it in sterile rooms with machines that measured the invisible. Audiologists psychologists speech pathologists all with their instruments and questionnaires seeking answers in the darkness of the human mind. No single test could reveal its presence with certainty. Like tracking some mythical beast they followed its spoor through the forest of human consciousness looking for signs and markers that might betray its presence. They presented sounds in pairs and groups watching how the mind failed to separate them like a prospector sifting through river mud for precious metals that might or might not exist.",
            "They were all of them broken things. That's what I'd seen. Souls fractured and scattered like shattered glass on concrete, glinting dangerous in the sun. I knew then what I must do. The path ahead lay clear as bones bleached white in desert sand. Social work. To wade into the darkness where children huddle against walls and families eat themselves alive with poison words and harder things.\n\nThe values rode with me like old companions. Service. Respect. Ethics raw and pure as winter wind. Commitment to mend what's torn between people and to keep my own blade sharp for the work ahead. These weren't just words written in some college manual. They were blood truth.\n\nI wandered long years uncertain, watching folks try to outrun their demons. Some found the bottle. Others found worse things. I studied psychology then, trying to understand the machinery of hurt. But understanding ain't enough. Never was.\n\nThe boy came in summer. Sixteen and scared, perched on my friend's couch like a wounded bird. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave marks deeper than skin. I went to their house next day after he called the law. Told the police my credentials, such as they were. They let me talk to the parents. Watched them squirm and lie, calling their boy manipulative, calling violence simple disputes. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nJustice is a strange thing in this world. We talk about individuals like they're precious gold but try to stamp them all the same shape. I never did take to that. Colored my hair wild as desert flowers, marked my flesh with metal, stood with the outcasts and the different ones. Fought against the darkness of racism and hate wherever it showed its teeth. Some folks call that rebellion. I call it truth.\n\nThe road ahead is dark and full of thorns, but I'll walk it anyway. Because somewhere out there children are crying in the night, and somebody's got to answer.",
            "Sleep and its disorders lay before us like ancient riddles writ in the flesh of man. They come in forms both primary and secondary, though such distinctions matter little to those who walk the midnight hours seeking rest that will not come. There are those who study these afflictions, cataloging them in neat rows like bones in an archaeologist's tent, sorting them into categories they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that taste of dust and academia.\n\nThe sleepless ones. They carry their burden like a cross, dragging it through days that blur into nights that refuse to yield their peace. Primary Insomnia they call it, when sleep becomes a stranger for thirty nights or more. Its dark brother, Hypersomnia, drags its victims down into endless drowning sleep, while Narcolepsy strikes like a rattler, sudden and without mercy.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the terrible machinery of the brain, neurons fire their ancient signals. They speak in tongues of orexin, these messengers of wake and sleep. The scientists, they took their mice and watched these neurons dance. GABAB receptors, they said, like gatekeepers at the edge of consciousness. When they forced these gates open with their chemicals - baclofen they called it - sleep came like a flood. The mice slept, and in their sleep they carried secrets about our own darkness.\n\nBut the truth of sleep lies deeper than receptors and neurons. It runs in bloodlines, passes from father to son like eye color or the shape of hands. When these inherited gates are broken, sleep becomes a ghost, haunting but never touching, and the sleepless ones must drag themselves through their days like wounded animals. They sit in fluorescent-lit offices, stand at assembly lines, drive their children to school, all while carrying the weight of endless waking, their eyes burning like coals in the desert of consciousness.",
            "He'd been there two and a half years or thereabouts, counting time in semesters like notches on a gun. The campus stretched vast and unforgiving before him, a concrete wilderness where souls wandered lost between buildings old as sin and new as tomorrow's promise. That first year they'd put him in East Halls, far out on the eastern edge where civilization gave way to the stadium's hulking shadow. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever hell the Pennsylvania weather chose to unleash, and it was always choosing.\n\nAn old graduate, not much older than himself but carrying the wisdom of years past, spoke of times when East Halls stood alone in a sea of empty land, like an island of brick and mortar in an ocean of nothing. Now that emptiness had been filled with the bones of progress - sports fields and buildings rising like monoliths from the earth, the Creamery and health services among them, apartment complexes circling like vultures on the periphery. The campus grew like a living thing, devouring space, making distance an enemy to be conquered.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but the idea of it, the promise of freedom in two wheels and a chain. He'd heard tell of a friend who'd returned to cycling after years away, speaking of it like a man who'd found religion again. Bikes are great, the friend had said, the words carrying the weight of prophecy. For a time they weren't cool but they were always right, always true.\n\nHe lived off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bicycle had been an investment in survival. Thomas building loomed twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bike cut through time like a blade, reducing the journey to five minutes of pure velocity. Pollock Road lay between, a straight shot but treacherous, populated by wandering souls and metal beasts. Walking was for those with time to burn, and time was a currency he couldn't spare. Each day without the bike would cost him forty minutes, time multiplied across days and weeks until it became a burden too heavy to bear.",
            "They came for the machines and the money both. In the pages of his testament Huxley had seen it coming like a storm rolling across the plains of human consciousness, dark and vast and terrible. The people in his vision stood as cattle in their pens, branded with letters that marked their worth, their minds scrubbed clean of individual thought by the relentless whispers in the night. They called it conditioning. A word clean as bleached bone but beneath it lay something darker.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some pagan god of old, dispensing happiness like communion wafers, hollow and tasteless but necessary all the same. Through the lens of Marx's prophecies you could see the truth of it, written in the blood of human autonomy. Words like homogeny and reification rattled like dead men's teeth in the skull of progress.\n\nThe false consciousness lay upon them like a burial shroud. The lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, all of them marked and numbered like livestock - moved through their days in a soma-induced haze, buying and spending and rutting with mechanical precision. They knew nothing of their chains. The Alphas and Betas watched from their towers of privilege, knowing but not speaking, seeing but not acting. Bernard alone stood witness, though his testimony fell on ears stopped with cotton and comfort.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. The characters moved through their assigned roles like marionettes, strings pulled by unseen hands. The men spoke of women as if describing machinery - pneumatic, functional, interchangeable parts in the great engine of society. The women catalogued their couplings like accountants tallying figures in a ledger. Each caste accepted their place with the quiet resignation of the damned, consuming their allotted pleasures, obeying their prescribed commandments, walking in lockstep toward some horizon they could neither see nor understand.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The walls were white and clean like bones bleached in the desert sun. Men and women argued whether this faith carried violence in its heart. The question echoes still, louder now than before, like thunder rolling across empty plains.\n\nSince the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens changed their tune. First with venom and spite then with a sweetness that seemed false as a serpent's smile. Strange days these are when a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale sits heavy in my hands. Words that dont match the blood-soaked history I know. They tell of a gentle man but history whispers different truths. In the old stories he rode with sword and flame, making converts of the conquered. Yet here in these pages he walks humble and meek, waiting for men to find truth in his words like water in the desert.\n\nThe writers laid their words careful as trappers setting snares. They painted miracles that mirror the Christ's own works. Mutton and milk multiplied like loaves and fishes. A mockery. They stole the holy stories and dressed them in different clothes, thinking none would notice the theft.\n\nThey built their truth on whispers. One man telling another who told another still, like wind carrying dust across empty places. Each story passed through many mouths before finding paper, and truth has a way of changing shape when it travels so far.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they made him holy. Gentle. Wise. But history carries darker truths, written in blood and steel. I wonder if the faithful know what darkness sleeps in their prophet's past, what violence birthed their faith. Some truths are better left in shadow, but they have a way of finding light.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of time while the world spun on and men spoke of things they knew nothing about. The truth of it was simple enough. Christianity had wandered far from where it began, like some nomadic tribe lost in the wasteland, each generation straying further from the path until they forgot there ever was one.\n\nNow the world turns different. Progressive they call it. The old ones still cling to their ways like driftwood in a flood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak. There's a awakening coming. Like thunder rolling across the plains. People wanting to strip away the layers of doctrine built up like rust on iron, wanting to find what lies beneath. Might take years. Might take centuries. Don't matter none. It'll come just the same.\n\nThey'll peel back time like the skin of some ancient fruit. Layer by layer. Until there ain't nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about what God wanted. When it comes it'll sweep through like wildfire. Through the cities and the towns. Through the old world and the new. The church'll still stand but it'll be different. Like a house stripped down to its bones.\n\nWhere there was many there'll be one. Where there was difference there'll be sameness. It's happened before. Rome hunted Christians like wolves then bent its knee to the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up and up comes down.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading from some ledger but like reading smoke signals against the sky. Looking for meaning behind meaning.\n\nBack before all this there was only the Jews. Back when Rome first marched into Jerusalem like they owned it. Sixty-three years before the birth of Christ. The Jews weren't one people then neither. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. Common folk. All of them different as night and day but all reading from the same book. One God. One truth. One holy text. That's how it started.",
            "There aint no mercy in the hearts of men. The Jungle shows us this truth plain as day and black as night. Deep in their cores men harbor only greed and self-preservation, a darkness that spreads like poison through their veins. They look not below them save to crush what lies beneath their boots.\n\nYou see it clearest in them factory owners and their kind. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, caring nothing for the cost. Their ambitions rise like great black monoliths against the dying sky, and Sinclair writes of it thus: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries with it the dreams and lives of thousands, drifting off into nothingness while the masters count their coins.\n\nThese men care nothing for the destruction they wrought. Not for the poisoned earth nor the fouled waters running thick with offal from their killing floors. The air itself turned rank with the stench of progress, and still they pushed on, driven by that ancient hunger that knows no satisfaction.\n\nTheir workers was nothing more than cattle to them. Expendable. Replaceable. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair called it, where \"no man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till his bones cracked then cast him aside like a spent shell casing, no more thought given than to the hogs they butchered.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown knew no salvation. No law protected them, no angel watched over their suffering. The unions that claimed to be their salvation was nothing but vultures picking at the same corpse. They was slaves in all but name, bound not by chains but by poverty and desperation. \"Here is a population,\" the truth rings out, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" And so it was, and so it remains, the dark heart of man beating its terrible rhythm through the ages.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Like a father with his favorite child. In it he wrote of Thulé, that word appearing twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, and Mabbott in his wisdom traced it back to Virgil who spoke of some forsaken island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there was something else. Something closer. The German scribes had caught Poe's eye and held it.\n\nThe truth of it lay in how Poe knew Goethe's work, deep and terrible. Arndt, in his scholarly wanderings through Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, saw the ghost of one in the other, like a man recognizing his own reflection in muddy water.\n\nOxford tells us Goethe was a giant among men who birthed Faust into the world in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in 1832 when death finally claimed him. Hidden in that second part was \"The King of Thulé,\" a dark tale of a king whose queen passed leaving him naught but a goblet. He drank deep of his grief until the cup overflowed with tears and memory. When his time came he gave away all he owned save that cursed vessel. Walked to the edge of the world and cast it into the hungry sea before closing his eyes one final time. That king and the wraith in Dreamland might have been brothers, both shaped by loss and drink and darkness.\n\nGrattan took Faust and made it his own in 1842, not a year before Poe wrote of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Like blood calling to blood. Twice Poe conjured Thule in his writings, once in Pendulum and twice more in Dreamland like bookends holding up worlds of shadow. Read them together, Goethe's King and Poe's Dreamland, and you'll see the same darkness reflected. The speaker walks through places where color goes to die, where ghosts of dead friends whisper on the wind, where loneliness has made its kingdom. Just as Goethe's king walked through his own private hell after his queen's passing.\n\nPoe knew Goethe as sure as night knows day, if only through Tennyson whom he praised like a prophet. But there were other ways Goethe's words might have found him, carried on the winds of countless retellings after the master's death.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than any statute writ by men in their towers of concrete and steel. In the florescent-lit aisles of D&D Markets the applesauce spread like some viscous harbinger, a portent of what was to come while Martin sat in his office eating his dinner with the same methodical indifference that marked all his days.\n\nThey had told him twice. Wayne first and then Haddigan quarter hour later, their voices carrying the same warning through the stale store air but Martin had dismissed them both with words that hung like lead in the empty space between them. Didn't have time for customer complaints, he'd said, though time was all there was and all there ever would be.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if the world had been waiting for just such a moment. Her body twisted and broke against the hard tile floor like something preordained, her spine crackling with a sound like dry kindling. The fifth such falling that year, or perhaps the sixth, as if the store itself had developed a taste for broken bodies and spilled blood.\n\nThe question before the court was one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether Martin's disregard carried within it that special kind of darkness the law calls malice. The California code spoke of oppression and fraud and malice like ancient runes carved in legal stone, demanding proof of despicable conduct or willing disregard for the safety of others. And there was something in Martin's actions that spoke to this, something in the way he sat eating while knowing what lay in wait in his aisles, knowing what had come before and what would surely come again.\n\nThe judge would see it. In the cold fluorescent light of the courtroom he would recognize that special kind of darkness that lives in men who watch others suffer while they sup, who hear warnings and turn away, who know the consequences and choose them anyway. For this was not mere negligence but something older, something that spoke to the darkness that lives in all men's hearts.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a hunger. Started when she was fourteen and hadnt left her yet. Three years gone and still it gnawed. Not a thing she needed now but someone and yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They made their clumsy advances like yearling colts testing weak legs but she turned from them all. She studied this emptiness like a crow picking through bones but found no answers there. Just the endless wanting and the questions that followed behind like pallbearers at a funeral that wouldnt end.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through the rooms like ghosts barely disturbing the air. No shouting. No tears. When words did rise between them and their daughter they were about her wildness, her need to run free like some unbroken mare. She carried a fire in her that burned bright against their stillness but folk took to her anyway. Something in that flame drew them close despite the risk of burning.\n\nThen came the day when quiet broke. A cry cut through the morning air sharp as a blade. Kitchen way. Her mothers voice twisted into something wrong. She ran calling out mama mama but the only answer was pain wrapped in short breaths. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something fallen from a great height. Touch gentle as prayer on her mothers shoulder. Take me to the hospital child the words coming broken and scattered like birds shot from the sky. She gathered her mother up blessed now for the strength in her arms. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air was thick with death and antiseptic but she noticed none of it. Her world had narrowed to her mothers pain and the need to end it. Called out and white coats came running their faces masks of concern. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left her there in the waiting room with nothing but time and worry for company.\n\nAll this because a vase set too high needed reaching and a stepstool proved treacherous as any snake in the garden.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not in words but in the absence of dead hearts, in the flowing of clean blood through untainted vessels. They called it aMed, this scoring of meals, this counting of plants and fish and the oils that men had pressed from fruit since time before memory.\n\nThe old studies spoke their piece. Numbers carved into ledgers showing how men who ate from the earth's abundance, who shunned the heavy fats of beasts, lived longer. Their hearts beat stronger. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that silent killer that steals mind and movement alike.\n\nSeventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women they watched. Nurses all of them, scattered across eleven states like seeds in the wind. For twenty years they marked their eating in questionnaires, six times from 1984 to 2004, documenting each morsel as if writing their own salvation. They were faithful in their reporting, these women, more than ninety-five in every hundred staying true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they searched through papers and certificates, autopsy reports telling tales of failed hearts and blocked vessels. Some they called probable, when the papers weren't there to tell the tale. Seventeen percent of strokes, twenty-four percent of heart failures, marked down in their ledgers like notches on a gun.\n\nThey tracked everything. Weight and smoke and pills. The movement of bodies in leisure and the changes that time brings to women's flesh. The numbers spoke of protection. Those who followed the old ways, eating as their ancestors did from the Mediterranean shores, they lived longer. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke, one thousand seventy-seven souls claimed by the combined assault. But those who ate from the earth's bounty, they stood stronger. The numbers said so. Zero point seven one, they wrote in their books. A mathematical blessing, a ward against death.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign said. Just that and nothing more upon the cardboard held aloft by the girl actor who'd once played pregnant in that picture show. She stood there in the gray morning like some soothsayer of old bearing portents and auguries.\n\nThey called it Burma though that wasnt its name no more. A land of temples and soldiers where men in ochre robes walked the streets in silence until they didnt. Until the streets ran red with their blood and the monasteries lay broken and burning in the perpetual dusk of that strange country. The government men had come up through ranks like carrion birds ascending, nineteen sixty two it was, and they ruled with iron and lead and all manner of cruelty that men devise when power fills their gullets.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Saffron Revolution they called it though revolution it wasnt, just death dealt out like playing cards in some cosmic game where the house always wins. A Japanese man with a camera lay dying in the street while they watched. Thirteen dead said the papers but the colonel who fled knew different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nThese things aint new. Since men first gathered in tribes there been those who'd rule absolute. Roman emperors who claimed kinship with gods. Japanese kings who were gods themselves. Even now our own president takes counsel from prophets and madmen who speak in tongues of power and control.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. Tiananmen where tanks rolled over students who dared to dream. Rwanda where neighbor killed neighbor until the streets stank of death. Hitler's own Reich where the crematoriums burned day and night without ceasing. All of it written in blood on pages that history turns with indifferent hands.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms long across the wasteland of jazz, not just in years but in the way he shaped and molded his orchestra like some dark craftsman at his forge. His piano work whispers through the compositions like wind through dead grass, but as architect of sound he built cathedrals of brass and wood where soloists could wander like prophets in the wilderness. He knew the voices of his men, knew them like a father knows his sons, and he wrote for their souls as much as their instruments. The framework he built was both prison and liberation, the tightly wound phrases and loose improvisations existing in the same space like light and dark at twilight.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of ancient scripture, noting how he made the human voice into something otherworldly, stripped of words and meaning save what the soul could conjure. Six times the piece turns upon itself like a serpent consuming its tail. First comes the voice, pure as spring water then rough as desert stone, calling to the reeds that answer like lost children. Then the trumpet emerges from the darkness, muted and blue as midnight, followed by the clarinet that climbs toward heaven while the piano walks beneath it like a shadow. The full band rises up like a great beast, brass and reed speaking in tongues, until the fifth turning when everything reaches toward something unseen and terrible and beautiful. In the end the voice returns, growling like some creature that has forgotten it was once human, and the trombone speaks the final dissonant words like a priest delivering last rites.\n\nA year later he conjured Hot and Bothered from the void, Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice speaking to each other like lovers in a dead language. And when It Don't Mean a Thing emerged from the darkness, Nanton's trombone spoke first, as if announcing the coming of something that could not be named. This was Ellington's way, to take the human and make it instrument, to take the brass and make it flesh, until you could no longer tell where one ended and the other began.",
            "They come to us like questions in the dark. How the beasts of field and forest take their shapes and why. What forces bind them to their forms like prisoners to their chains. In 1917 Thompson wrote of how even the learned men of science had not yet begun to speak of living things in the tongue of numbers and equations and even now his words ring true across the wasteland of years.\n\nThe shells lie before us like calcified histories. Each one a testament to some ancient geometry that we cannot name. We study them, these remnants of Prunum, these spiral tombs of the creatures that once dwelt within. We gather their ghosts through machines that peer through their walls with invisible light and we feed these spectral measurements to newer machines that speak in electricity and silicon.\n\nThe shell is a prison built by its inmate, constructed in slow circles through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of eternal return. The whorls spiral like a rope around nothing, around an axis that exists only in theory, in the mind. The columella stands sentinel at the center of it all. Each revolution grows according to some mathematical truth that we can only glimpse, like seeing shapes in smoke. The sutures mark time like notches on a prisoner's wall.\n\nWe arrange them in our taxonomies. Apical. Basal. Apertural. Abapertural. Words we use to impose order on chaos. We count the whorls like counting rings in a tree, measuring quarter turns as if such precision matters in the face of geological time. The aperture traces its path through space like a bullet through the dark, leaving behind only its calcified wake.\n\nIn the end we reduce it all to numbers. Coordinates. Trajectories. As if we could capture the essence of life in equations. As if we could understand the mind of God through mathematics. But the shells remain what they are. Silent witnesses to processes we can only pretend to comprehend.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like dark seeds in the earth, their numbers unchanging through the years, a grim testament carved in stone. The nation moved forward in some ways, meeting goals for water and clean places to shit, but the mothers and their young ones kept dying just the same, their blood seeping into soil that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey said more births now had someone who knew the old ways, seven of ten maybe, women who'd learned their craft from their mothers and grandmothers before them. But when the blood came, really came, these women stood helpless as the rest, watching life drain away in crimson rivers. Numbers on paper meant nothing to death. It took what it wanted.\n\nIn the cities they cut women open to save them, but not many. Four in hundred maybe. Out in the places where dirt roads turned to mud and electricity came and went like a fickle god, fewer still. The rich got their medicine and their doctors. The poor got their prayers. Twenty-seven percent difference between them, the bureaucrats said, as if poverty could be measured in clean decimals instead of dead children.\n\nThey argued about it in offices with air conditioning, whether to build special programs or fix the whole broken machine. Vertical approaches, they called them, like ladders to heaven. But every ladder they built seemed to steal from another, and the forms and papers multiplied like rats in a granary. Money flowed to AIDS while babies died of diarrhea, and the doctors chased the dollars like crows following a plow. Nothing changed except the numbers on the reports, and those numbers were written in blood.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, spreading like windblown seed across the land until no man could count its varieties. And these varieties bred new varieties and those bred still more until the names themselves became a babel of confusion. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning children darker and stranger than their fathers.\n\nAmong these bastard sons none grew more twisted and manifold than the thing they called Heavy Metal. It came slouching out of the darkness forty years ago and in its wake followed legions. Each new breed carrying some mark of its sire but warped and changed like creatures born in atomic fire. The darkness in it spoke to something in men's souls and they took it and shaped it to their own designs, each new shaping breeding yet more shapes until the very thing that spawned them all became impossible to name.\n\nNow the metal walks among us in countless forms, like some demon that can wear any face it chooses. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, back to the source of the darkness. For metal aint just music. It's a movement born in shadow and raised on blood and thunder.\n\nThey made it louder, heavier, more violent than what came before. The players were virtuosos of chaos, their instruments howling like the damned. And there were drugs, yes. In those mid-seventies years when the psychedelics flowed like water and men's minds turned to strange horizons. They made records that sound like dispatches from hell itself, blame it on the drugs if you want but the darkness was there already, waiting. The pretty music of those days couldn't speak to what was coming. But metal could. Metal did. Like some dark reflection of the Romantic composers of old, it reached into the shadows of men's souls and pulled forth something terrible and true.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of something ancient and terrible. The Dream they called it. Nineteen hundred and ten. A woman lost in some savage paradise while beasts with eyes like burning coals watched from the darkness of the jungle. But the real dream was his own and it gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition. Acceptance. The approval of men who painted in ways he could not understand but desperately wished to join.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard against the slate roofs and the streets ran with mud. No teacher ever showed him how to hold a brush or mix colors or capture the light that fell across the world like God's own thoughts. For forty years he collected tolls from travelers while the art lived inside him like some trapped animal trying to claw its way free. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. His first wife Clémence died and took eight babies with her to the cold ground leaving only Julia behind. The grief sat in him like lead and he turned to painting like a man turns to whiskey, hoping to drown something that cannot be drowned.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. While Matisse and the others carved their names into history with wild colors and shapes that defied God's own design Rousseau labored in his simple way trying to make pictures that would please the men who decided such things. Matisse feared convention like it was a poison but Rousseau sought it like salvation. Two men walking different roads in the same dark wood. One running from what the other was running toward.\n\nThe folk painters heart beat in him true as any clock. He painted what he knew and what he dreamed and what he feared all at once and the pictures came out strange and wonderful though he never meant them to be. His dreams of acceptance lay in him like stones but the pictures that came from his hands were something else entirely. Something wild. Something true.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road. Been that way since before any living soul drew breath. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, beauty being truth and truth being all we need know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but the knowing of right and wrong, the seeing of what's beautiful, that comes from somewhere deeper. Like an old well that ain't got no bottom.\n\nYou can study it all you want. Write down rules about what makes something right or pretty. But they're just words on paper, trying to catch smoke in your hands. Take that painting, the Mona Lisa. Folk talk about shadow and light, about what was happening in Italy back then, but that ain't really it. When someone loves a thing, really loves it, first words out their mouth is always something like \"there's just something about it.\" Rest comes after, like trying to explain why you love your momma.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things can only be told in stories because regular talk won't do. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who ain't never drunk none. Same goes for knowing right from wrong. Wittgenstein said ethics can't be spoke of proper, and he wasn't wrong. There's something in both art and right living that sits beyond words, like a far-off mountain you can see but never reach.\n\nWay I figure it, that's why stories and morals run so close together, like two streams joining in the valley. They both hit us somewhere deep, somewhere we can feel but can't point to. Literature especially. McKean had it right when he said books carry moral weight same as life does. Can't live without choosing between right and wrong, and can't tell stories without doing the same. That's what makes them matter. That's what makes them true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like a sentinel, unified and stark against the heavens, its essence flowing from the shadow-kept valleys of München where the alps loom black and ancient to the cold waters of Kiel where the Baltic meets the shore in eternal conflict. This essence, this blood-memory, courses through the veins of cities from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep and merciless, through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe winds like a steel serpent through Saxon stone. And in this land where darkness and light wage their endless war, the roots run deep into soil watered by the blood of tribes long forgotten.\n\nGermania. The word itself carries weight like old bones in the earth. Men argue its meaning like crows fighting over carrion, each pecking at truth with black beaks. Tacitus, that Roman who peered into the darkness beyond the empire's reach, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with fire and steel, becoming Germans in the crossing. Caesar too marked them in his writings, ink flowing like blood across parchment as he recorded their raids, their savage dance across borders that meant nothing to them. The word itself perhaps meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls, or maybe it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, death-dealer in the hands of warriors. Or perhaps it rose from garim, a scream in the Old Irish night, for these were a people who made the darkness echo with their war-cries.\n\nTacitus wrote of them as if writing of wolves or winter storms, creatures born of the land itself. Not mixed with others, he said, for who would choose such wilderness, such brutal skies, such a land that wore its hostility like a crown? The Germans were aboriginal, sprung from soil and ice and darkness.\n\nThe Romans came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry, leading their legions into the depths of Germania only to retreat again to their marble cities and heated baths. And the Germans remained, trading with the empire that feared them, serving in its armies while keeping their own savage hearts. They dwelt in the borderlands like shadows at the edge of firelight, taking what they needed from the land and from Rome itself, patient as winter, eternal as the forests that bore them.",
            "In the dark heart of Twelfth Night there dwells a truth about masks and the wearing of them, how they serve their purpose like a knife serves its wielder but in time will turn against the flesh that holds them. The shedding of such guises becomes necessary lest the wearer lose themselves to the void that lies between what is and what seems to be. But there aint no easy way to cast off what's become a second skin and them that's been deceived may turn cold as winter stone or hot as desert fury when the truth comes calling.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own peculiar burden, like a snake that eats its own tail, forever asking why. Why does the soul seek to shed its given form and take up another? Viola speaks plain enough about it: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nShe come to these foreign shores alone and afraid and took up man's clothing like armor against the world's malice. But such protection carries its own poison. It sets her apart from her own kind, leaves her to walk alone among women who might have been sisters to her. And Olivia, God help her, sees in Viola's disguise what she wants to see, calling out \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead birds from her lips. And there's Orsino too, speaking words that cut like broken glass: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nMaybe them that read these words now might see something deeper, like looking into a well at midnight. Maybe they'd say this tale shows how lies can sometimes midwife truth into the world, especially in Olivia and Orsino's case. Their desires lay buried like bones in the desert until Viola's deception dug them up. Some might wonder if Olivia's heart truly yearned for women all along, but that aint likely what Shakespeare meant. More like he was mocking them that judge love by its container rather than its contents.\n\nYou can see it clear as day when Olivia turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a rattler strikes, and speaks to Viola like blood kin: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words ring true at last, like a bell in the darkness that finally finds its proper tone.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in whispers. Of cruelties visited upon the Ovaherero and the Nama peoples in that sunscorched land they called South West Africa. But empires aint built on simple tales and the Germans ruled different lands different ways and some flourished while others withered beneath the weight of their governance.\n\nIn the east where the British come to rule in 1919 they found natives who could read and write and cipher numbers like educated men. Same in Kamerun where even the white men spoke well of what the Germans had done. But South West Africa was different. Something darker there.\n\nThe missionaries come with their books and their crosses but the government gave them nothing. No help. No coin. While the white children got their schools built fine with government money and the mission schools for whites got what they needed too. These things cast long shadows and while other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their way in the white man's world South West Africa remained in darkness. Its people untouched. Unlearned. Unable to read the very papers that marked their fate.\n\nMen wrote about these things. German men mostly, in the early days of the century, putting down in their own tongue what they saw in these far places. Later others come. English speakers who looked at how different colonies fared different fates. Cohen was one. He wrote about the schools in South West Africa and East Africa both, trying to make sense of why one flourished while the other failed. He said it was the settlers that made the difference. Too many whites in South West Africa wanting to keep things their way.\n\nThe land there wasnt like the other colonies. Not so hot. Not so wet. Desert mostly but liveable if you were white and determined. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had made it their home while East Africa, the next most settled place, had barely five thousand. They come for the temperate air and the promise of mastery over the land and its people. And master it they did.",
            "They rode forth across that contested earth, these two nations, like ancient enemies bound by blood and soil. From 1836 to 1893 they circled each other like wounded wolves, fifty-seven years of malice carved into the very ground beneath them. The war came in 1846, as wars do, and the American forces descended upon Mexico like locusts, stripping away Texas and the Southwest territories, leaving behind nothing but dust and memory.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all neighbors cursed by proximity they found in each other a mirror of their own fears, their own hatreds. Their differences ran deep as burial grounds - God and custom and the old ways setting them apart like oil and water in a jar. Cuba too stood watching from across the water, another thorn in the American flesh, while the rest of Latin America kept its distance, wise perhaps in its caution.\n\nReligion lay between them like a rusted blade. The Protestant Americans carried their prejudices from the old world, wearing their distrust of Catholics like armor, just as their English forebears had done. The Spanish shadow fell long across Mexico, and in its darkness old hatred grew like weeds in untended fields.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those bitter years, mostly over the border that cut through the land like a scar. Bandits and murderers moved across it like ghosts, striking at towns on both sides, until finally both nations sent their armies to stand watch over that invisible line. The rivalry died slow, like all ancient things must die, when Mexico fell into the economic embrace of its northern neighbor, American ambition turning from land to money, as it always does in the end.\n\nThe old ways changed. The old blood dried. But the memory remained, etched into the stones and the sand and the bones of all those who died in that time when two nations stared across a line drawn in dust, each seeing in the other a darkness they feared in themselves.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before it took me.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some hollow need for safety, the kind that gets bred into you when you're young and afraid. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always be dying or trying not to. So I buried deeper things, dreams of science and truth-telling, and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThere I was at forty-six. Alone. No money to speak of and work become impossible as breath to a hanged man. Fifteen years living on government alms and now nothing remains that's truly mine. Each day comes like a thief in the night, stealing what little security remains. Nothing certain anymore except this one truth: that without my blood kin and the few true friends, I'd have been gone to dust. When the real darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense of strength.\n\nLife's got its catastrophes waiting, big and small like wolves in the night. No matter how you prepare some storms are too big to weather alone. Ain't no guarantee written in stone or sky.\n\nThe government's basket's got holes and the bottom's falling out, sure as sunrise. But better we learn to trust each other again than each man digging his own grave in the backyard calling it shelter. They talk about rugged individualism like it built this nation, but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing was mercy and respect and the sharing of what little they had. Them wagon trains didn't cross the mountains one by one.\n\nSo lay in your stores. Keep your matches dry and your water clean. Stack your canned goods like gold bars if you want. Plant your garden if the earth'll have you. But while you're doing all that surviving, remember your neighbor's light in the window. Might be the only thing between you and the dark when it comes.",
            "He was born a prince in the old world, in times when men still believed the earth was flat and the heavens hung low like a tapestry of black velvet studded with cold fire. They would later call him Buddha. The years counted backward twenty five hundred times since then, since he walked away from wealth and crown to seek what lay beyond the veil of human suffering. What he found became Buddhism and the Theravada followed, pure as mountain water, orthodox as stone.\n\nThe thing that was then aint the thing that is now. In Sri Lanka they cut water once each year, monks and common folk gathered like dark birds at the edge of sacred pools, performing rituals the Buddha never spoke of. Time changes all things. Even truth. Even doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist folk, them that wear robes and them that dont, have watched their beliefs shift like sand in desert winds, pushed by forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all but bringing change regardless.\n\nWords matter here. Internal is what comes from inside the Buddhasasana, be it monk or layman that brings it. External is all else, the outsider, the stranger, the other. Some forces come with teeth bared and claws extended, seeking to tear down what Buddha built. These are hostile. Others come blank-faced and indifferent, neither meaning good nor ill, though they may bring either. These are benign. Remember these words. They'll come again.\n\nThe heart of it all beats steady beneath. Three jewels they seek refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient words. Suttas telling tales and teachings. Vinaya speaking law. Abhidhamma reaching into the spaces between spaces where metaphysics dwell. They speak of Anatta, the great emptiness where soul should be. Of Dukkha, the suffering that runs through all things like dark threads through pale cloth. Of Anicca, how nothing lasts, nothing stays, nothing holds. Know these and you might break free of Sansara, that wheel that turns and turns, grinding life into death into life again. Break free of want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya tells how to live. Five rules for common folk: kill not, lie not, steal not, keep your loins in check, stay clear of drink and drugs that cloud the mind. Monks got more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all stand four truths like stone pillars holding up the sky. Life is suffering. Want brings suffering. Suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

To hold his breath underwater. To run. To climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted someone to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with him in the highest branches of the pine behind the barn. But Doodle with his weak heart wasnt meant for such things. The doctors said he might not even live and if he did hed never be strong enough for what his brother dreamed. The older boy even thought about smothering Doodle with a pillow like you might do to some suffering animal. But when that small broken thing smiled at him something in his heart cracked open and let the light in. Even if just for a moment.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing simple. It sits in the skull like some terrible engine, processing the world through meat and electricity and time. Men once thought it soft like wax or flat like paper or bound like some holy book but now they name it computer and processor and machine. These words too shall pass like wind through autumn trees, leaving only half-truths in their wake.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and violent. Light and sound and heat, all of it transformed by organs older than language into signals that race through the darkness behind our eyes. These signals pass through layers of knowing like water through stone, each layer writing its own truth upon them. When a man looks upon a black box against white, his mind builds it piece by piece like a carpenter. First the edges, sharp as obsidian against the pale. Then the shape emerges from darkness, but the mind already knows what it seeks. It hunts for boxes in the void, finding them before they fully form.\n\nAttention sits like a gatekeeper at the crossroads of thought, deciding what passes and what dies in the dark. The grass beneath your boots contains multitudes, but the mind lets them fade like morning mist. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room cuts through the chaos like a knife. The mind decides what matters and what don't, and it decides again and again until the deciding becomes truth.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments. Some fresh as morning dew, others buried deep in the loam of years. The mind takes words and makes them ghosts - sometimes as shapes on paper, sometimes as echoes in the skull, sometimes as meaning stripped bare of all else. They say working memory is like electricity dancing through meat, a brief carnival of light lasting twenty seconds before the darkness returns. Long-term memories hide in the very substance of us, in proteins twisted like barbed wire around the truth.\n\nMen who study such things have drawn maps of knowledge like old explorers mapping terra incognita. They speak of networks of meaning, where chair begets table begets wood begets tree, all connected like veins in the body of knowing. But these are just maps, and the territory they describe remains wild and unknowable as the desert night.",
            "They called it a crisis but that word was too clean for what came. In the year of our Lord 2007 the great machine of American prosperity shuddered and broke and left in its wake a darkness that stretched from sea to shining sea. Men who had built empires of paper watched them burn. The unemployed walked the streets like ghosts. Houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in years prior, when men in suits whose souls had long since been traded for power decided that everyone should own a piece of the American dream, whether they could afford it or not. Banks became merchants of false hope, dealing in loans that were poison, packaging them like bright candies and selling them to the unwitting. Fannie Mae and her twisted sister Freddie Mac danced to this tune of destruction, weaving spells of financial alchemy that turned lead into gold until the day the magic failed.\n\nIt began in the time of Clinton, that silver-tongued president who sought to extend his reign by making the people love him. In those days a man named Holmes spoke prophecy in the pages of the Times, warning of the darkness to come, but prophets are rarely heeded in their own time. The banks grew fat on the meat of bad debt, gorging themselves on the dreams of the poor and the desperate.\n\nThey built their tower of babel with strange words and stranger mathematics. Adjustable-rate mortgages. Collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The people leveraged their souls against houses they couldn't afford, and the banks leveraged their souls against the souls of the people, until the whole cursed edifice stood balanced on a knife's edge.\n\nWhen it fell, it fell hard. The great houses of money - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers - they fell like kings before the revolution. Four trillion in debt, a number so vast it loses all meaning. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed, transformed into something lesser, something mortal. And Fannie and Freddie, those twin architects of doom, fell into the arms of the government like condemned men into the arms of their executioner.",
            "The words lay there like bones bleached in desert sun. Exposition. A word that writers clutch to their breast like some holy talisman though it carries death in its teeth. They string these words together like rotting prayer beads thinking they might save their souls but there aint no salvation in mere telling.\n\nThe monitor glows pale and blue in the dark room and Dr Merlin screams at it. Not the good kind of screaming neither. Just the raw animal sound of someone who's read too many words that dont do nothing except take up space on the page. Words that dont work. Words that dont bleed.\n\nShow dont tell. That's what they say. Always been that way since stories first got told round fires in caves. But the devil he sits there on your shoulder whispering sweet poison. Tell em everything he says. Tell em bout the childhood and the dreams and the breakfast they ate. Tell em bout the gas station manager who once flew planes in wars he cant forget and who goes fishing on weekends to forget the wives who left him. Tell em everything and tell em nothing that matters.\n\nTruth is you got to put meat on them bones. Got to make the reader feel the knife when it goes in. When that husband dies in front of his wife you got to make em taste the copper of his blood in their own mouths. Got to make em hear his last breath rattling out like wind through dead leaves. Otherwise its just words. Just marks on a page that dont signify nothing except the writer's own failure to make the reader care.\n\nExposition aint your friend. Never was. Never will be. Its just the easy way out and there aint nothing worth having that comes easy in this world.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the news flickered across the screen like phantoms in the dark. First came word of Ashley where a man had done violence upon his wife with a blade. Hostettler they called him and his face stared out from the screen with eyes black as pitch and hollow as drought-dead wells. The story passed quick as summer rain.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis. Eighteen summers had passed over him before the bullets found him in Sharon Woods. No harbinger of who had done this thing. SWAT men moved through the streets like armored beetles but found nothing. The story died quiet and quick like stories of his kind always do in this world. White faces linger longer on the screen. White tears fall heavier. That's the way of it.\n\nThe helicopter story came next. Some fool with a twentytwo had put a hole in a flying machine meant for mercy. Five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. The money hung in the air like carrion birds circling.\n\nWeather came and went. Rain coming. Thunder too. Numbers that meant heat and time but signified nothing.\n\nThen the UDF robbery. They spoke of the thief's darkness like it was a sin itself. Six foot tall they said. One fifty. Wearing cotton pulled over his head like a shroud. The words fell heavy with meaning that wasnt about the crime at all.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez. Drug lord they called him. Three hundred months they gave him though they meant twentyfive years. The numbers rolled strange off their tongues like they were speaking in tongues. They marked him Hispanic like marking cattle though it meant nothing to the weight of his crimes. The news ended and the screen went dark and somewhere in the distance a siren wailed.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like a shadow across the financial plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of worth like some spectral thing that cannot be held but can be traded like common stock. It gives a man what they call diversification, same as any index fund might, but it carries with it the flexibility of a single share - the ability to sell short or buy on margin or purchase but one lonely share in the vast darkness of the market. The benefits lay there like gold coins in the dust but the costs, they run lower than what you'd pay them mutual fund men. There are drawbacks though. Always drawbacks in this world. You'll pay commission on every trade like you would with stock, no way around that truth.\n\nThe variety of these funds stretches out endless as the desert horizon but a man must look careful at what they promise. Diversification they say. Benefits they claim. But the wise investor, he must put these promises to the test like a prospector testing fool's gold against the real thing. We aim to examine one such creature called IHF, compare it against its ten biggest holdings like comparing a wolf to its teeth, see if owning the ETF brings the same bounty as owning them ten stocks separate, or if there might be some better way to arrange these same pieces.\n\nThe task of examining every holding would be like counting every grain of sand in the Mojave, so we took just the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of what's in there. They lay listed out like the names of the dead.\n\nTo reckon how true these ten stocks stand for the whole of IHF, we took their percentages and normalized them to a hundred, calculated what each one brings to the portfolio's Beta and Return if you was to build it just from these ten in the same proportions as the ETF holds them. The numbers stand stark in the chart below like cattle bones bleaching in the sun.\n\nThe figures tell a tale plain as day - a portfolio of just them top holdings runs 6.11 percent higher than the ETF itself, like a horse outrunning its shadow by sixteen percent. The Beta runs lower too, by point twelve. These numbers whisper that maybe them ten holdings alone might bring more reward with less risk. But numbers can lie like men can lie, and we needed to know if these differences were real as blood or just tricks of the light.",
            "The numbers fell like winter birds shot from the sky, there in the third month. You could see it plain in Figure 17, the way the logs dwindled and died. No man could say why for certain though theories stalked the margins of understanding like hungry wolves. Winter had come as it always did to New England, merciless and raw, driving the bicycle riders and walkers from the roads. December too brought its own peculiar madness - the rush of endings, of grades to be counted like cattle bones, of work piled high like cordwood before the storm. The commuter logs became ghosts, forgotten things.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud. Campus emptied, halls echoing with absence, parking lots barren as dead lakes. When January crawled back with its ice-teeth and iron sky, bringing students and teachers alike, the numbers stayed low, huddled against the cold. February offered no answers, just silence and snow.\n\nSome said it was natural, the way all things burn bright then fade. Like a fire dying to embers. We fought back with what weapons we had - the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate rally against the darkness. It worked some. The logs rose like smoke signals but the truth remained: the academic calendar was a beast that devoured momentum, swallowing whole months in its endless cycle of beginnings and endings.\n\nBut there was something deeper, something carved into the bone of American life itself. The car was freedom. Independence. A metal horse for the modern age. You could see it in their eyes when they gripped their steering wheels - that wild thing that wouldn't be tamed by coffee shop gift cards or restaurant vouchers. We gave these prizes like Indians trading beads, thinking they meant something. Maybe if we'd offered bigger game - sleek bicycles or those hybrid cars with their quiet engines, or even one of them electric vehicles that hummed like summer insects - maybe then we'd have seen different numbers in those cold months. Could have announced it like prophets: December bringing bicycles, January bringing hybrid chariots. Might have kept them believing, kept them logging their miles like pilgrims counting rosary beads. But we'll never know. Some questions don't have answers, just theories that circle like crows over a battlefield.",
            "I set to wandering through the old Edison reels laid up in the Library of Congress like ancient scrolls in some forbidden archive. Fifteen of them there were, dating from 1895 to 1901, each one a trick film meant to deceive the eye and mind both. They were crafted in ways that would make a man question what was real and what wasnt real and perhaps if there was any difference between the two at all.\n\nThe films stood like sentinels against time itself. Bound to their sets like prisoners to stakes, they peered out through a proscenium arch that knew neither movement nor mercy. The camera stood fixed and distant as God himself, watching through long shots and medium shots but never daring closer, as if some unwritten commandment had been laid down in the early days of moving pictures.\n\nIn those flickering images you could see the ghost of vaudeville haunting every frame. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, sliding sideways across the stage as if afraid to approach the eye that watched them. Take that peculiar piece they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and his fellow specters dance their sideways waltz, entering stage right like souls crossing the River Styx, but never advancing toward that glass eye that captured their movements for all time.\n\nThe rules of this new world were strict and unforgiving as desert law. One shot was one film, no more and no less, though sometimes the magicians behind the lens would splice their celluloid together in secret ways to make spirits appear and vanish like smoke. These tales rarely stretched beyond a minute's length, brief as life itself sometimes seems, and simpler than the stories told round campfires since time began.\n\nWatch close The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895 and you might catch the sleight of hand where they switched the living queen for her manufactured double. The trick is there plain as day if you know where to look, like the truth hiding in plain sight. But in those days folks weren't looking for truth in moving pictures. They were looking for magic, and magic they found in those strange mechanical dreams projected on white sheets in darkened rooms.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a contradiction bleeding through time like a wound that won't heal. Some call it hollow, others praise its terrible beauty, but truth dont care much for what men call things. Horace Walpole, he took what was old and what was new and stitched them together like some nightmarish creature, breathing life into what we now call Gothic. The Castle of Otranto it was called. A Gothic Story, he named it, simple as that.\n\nMedieval ghosts dance through these pages, stone walls and ancient rites rising up like dead things from the earth. Gothic they called it then, Gothic they call it now, though the word means different things to different men in different times. Some saw it as primitive, backward even, standing against the march of progress like a stubborn mule. But the marriage of theatrical Gothic ways with the intimacy of novel writing, that union survived, transformed, became something else entirely. Something that could speak to souls across centuries.\n\nChivalry runs through it all like blood through veins. The medieval knight, that ancient ideal of honor and courage, haunts these pages like a restless spirit. Walpole saw something missing in his time, something lost that needed finding again. The world he knew was sick with politics and lies, and maybe he thought the old ways, the gothic ways, held some cure for what ailed society. You can see it clear as day in characters like Frederic, who stands like some fever dream of what a knight should be.\n\nThey wrote him as suffering nobility, a prince who'd walked through fire and come out changed. Said he'd been killed by infidels, though dead men dont usually walk back into stories. The gallant and courteous Knight, they called him, though even then the description dripped with excess like honey from a broken comb, sweet but somehow wrong.",
            "The chain moves like blood through veins, goods passing raw and unformed through the stages of their becoming until they reach the hands that called for them. Oliver had named it in '82, this dark procession of material and want, though the thing itself was ancient as commerce and trade and the first bartering of shells for meat. He'd written of it in terms clinical and stark, speaking of implementation and control and satisfaction but the truth of it lay deeper, in the bone-knowledge of need and the fulfilling of it.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. The managers move between these pillars like priests of some mercantile faith, conducting their rituals of efficiency and service.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone on which all else rests. It begins with knowing, with reading the auguries of the market like ancient seers reading entrails, seeking in the patterns of purchase and desire what must be brought forth into the world. The managers peer into these depths and from them draw forth numbers, quantities, locations. They choose their grounds like generals planning campaigns, selecting which fortress of industry will birth which goods, measuring volume against quality against the endless hunger of demand.\n\nThey map the work in ledgers and computer screens, scheduling the labors like the movements of armies. Each detail matters, each minute particular bearing the weight of consequence. A misstep here cascades through the chain like poison in a river. He'd seen it himself in the great retail houses, Walmart and Target, where every action from the folding of a shirt to the receiving of a truck followed patterns laid down like scripture in their manuals and guides.\n\nSupply comes next, the choosing of capabilities and alliances. Like a general dividing his forces, management must decide which battles each division will fight, what specialties each will claim. Sometimes they send work out beyond their walls, seeking velocity - that holy grail of quality and flexibility won at the altar of reduced cost.",
            "They came in their volumes from that old time, those books bound in leather and gilt, speaking of drawing rooms and tea services and the finery of men who wore topcoats and carried silver-headed canes. But there were others. Dark things. Books that crawled with nightmares and the blackness that dwells in men's souls. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart, wrought in shadow and bearing witness to mysteries that lay beneath the surface of proper society like corpses in shallow graves.\n\nIn them the darkness speaks. Dreams come unbidden and terrible. In Oliver's tale the boy walks between Sikes and Crackit, phantoms made real in his fever-addled mind, their voices echoing as if across vast canyons of time. Gunfire splits the night. Screams pierce the darkness. Lights dance like witchfire before his eyes while pain, constant as original sin, gnaws at his bones. Some hand, unseen and perhaps guided by providence or perhaps by darker forces, bears him away through this carnival of horrors.\n\nThe dreams speak truth in these tales. In Oliver's story they reveal the rotting underneath, the helplessness of a child cast adrift in a world of wolves. When the shooting comes again in chapter twenty-eight it comes like judgment, like prophecy fulfilled. The boy relives it all, trapped in that moment between life and death while Sikes and Crackit hover over him like carrion birds. The pain is everywhere and nowhere, diffuse as morning fog, married now to fear rather than shock. Oliver drifts, powerless as a leaf in a river. Whatever will drove the bullet into his flesh, it was not his own. Here Fagin's poison has done its work, breaking something essential in the boy's soul, leaving him adrift in a world without mercy or meaning.\n\nTime itself bends and breaks. Day becomes night becomes day, all meaning lost in the terrible silence of darkness, in the fleeting hours that pass like shadows across the face of a dying moon.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Helping them with their studies and whatever troubles they had with their learning. English and reading being what I knew best. There was this boy Adrian, third or fourth grade he must have been, brought to me by one of the teachers on account of his troubles with reading. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters that should have come natural to him were foreign things and others he knew like old friends. He was Latino sure enough but spoke English clear as any native born child. We went on like that for a time until I saw his mother. \n\nI was watching some stragglers while the others had gone off somewhere when she came in. Not a word of English passed her lips. Just Spanish. My own Spanish being poor we managed somehow but that's when it hit me like judgment day. Adrian could read well enough but the English letters were strange creatures to him, different from what he knew at home.\n\nThis here is about the wall between languages in our schools, particularly in California where I am. Sometimes the wall aint as clear as we might think. Even children who speak English proper can find themselves lost in the reading of it like wanderers in some foreign land. We all know this truth but what's to be done about it. For Adrian the answer was simple enough. Show him the letters, teach him their sounds. But for those who barely know English at all the answer aint so clear.\n\nTheres no single path through this wilderness. Two-language teaching, throwing them in with English speakers, private teaching, special English classes. None of these alone will do what needs doing. The answer lies in using them all together like a man needs both horse and saddle to ride. The two-language way of teaching aint just good for Spanish speakers but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers though many fear it's a waste. If we made this the way of things instead of just sometimes doing it all would be better for it. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues. That aint realistic. But having helpers who know both languages, that's something we can do sure enough.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A thing vast and unknowable that dwells beyond the veil of comprehension. Some seek it in wooden pews and stained glass temples while others quest inward through the dark corridors of self. Many accept without question the ancient stories passed down like worn copper coins from parent to child. Others rage against these inheritances, these tales told in the night, proclaiming themselves sole arbiters of their universe. All of us wanderers in the dark, searching for that pale fire that might lead us from shadow into light.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We sat watching the rain beat against the tin roof, cigarette smoke rising like spectral fingers into the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain became one thing. His clothes hung from him like a scarecrow's rags, his hair thin as corn silk. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such darkness? I moved my chair closer to his and together we watched the rain fall through the June twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him did nothing but stretch his suffering like a wire pulled taut, vibrating with pain. I cursed whatever god might exist in that vast darkness. No prayers passed my lips in those long nights. If there was something out there listening it had turned away long ago, deaf to the suffering of men.\n\nI could not watch him die. Would not. The act of witnessing seemed a betrayal of all he had been in life. I knew him better than any of them. Knew he would not want his child to stand vigil at his ending. For three days I lay curled in my bed like some wounded animal, waiting for word of his passing.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The man Taylor of Caroline carried the flame of Republicanism in his heart like a torch in darkness. He worked the land with his hands and knew its ways, and from this knowing came his thoughts on freedom and the workings of men who would govern others. The soil was his teacher and his prophet both, and from it sprang forth all manner of opinion on how men should live and be ruled and what constituted right in this world.\n\nHe saw in this new country a thing that had never been, pristine and untouched by the old ways that plagued the minds of men across the water. Here lay virgin ground for self-governance, unsullied by ancient custom. The rights of man, he knew, were like links in an iron chain. Break one and the whole would fail, becoming nothing more than scattered metal in the dust. These rights stood beyond the reach of any government, sacred and inviolate.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelled in men's hearts. He saw how in nature the strong preyed upon the weak and how the clever-cruel prospered while the righteous suffered. But civilization, he reckoned, must stand against such base inclinations.\n\nThe good and the evil in man existed like two wolves in the same woods, and Taylor believed any government worth its salt must account for both. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the earth yield its bounty, and kept the moneylenders at bay. But even the finest government would draw the greedy and the power-hungry like carrion birds to flesh. Self-interest, that eternal force, moved through all men like blood through veins. Only when it turned parasitic, feeding off the labor of others, did it become a thing of evil.\n\nTaylor stood with those who held the Constitution as writ, not to be bent or twisted by clever men with sharp tongues. The federal beast, he knew, must be kept small and lean, lest it grow fat on the wealth of the people and turn tyrannical in its appetites. But words alone were not enough - the spirit of the law's makers must be remembered, like an old testament passed down through generations. And above all else stood the Declaration, that sacred scroll that spoke of sovereign states bound together not in bondage but in common cause.",
            "He stood and looked down and in looking down he saw what lay there before him and what lay there was nothing he had asked for nor wanted nor sought. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding slow and methodical and mechanical in its purpose yet serving no greater end than the watching itself. Thoughts came and went like wraiths in the desert wind leaving no trace of their passing.\n\nHe remembered the artist and the book she'd told him to buy. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called and in it lay all manner of instruction from the basic handling of pencil to the way the mind sees what it sees and makes of it what it will. The book spoke of frames and boundaries and how they could take the vast terrible wholeness of a thing and reduce it to something a man might comprehend. A kitchen becoming just a table becoming just a bowl of fruit sitting there patient and indifferent to the eye that beheld it.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No boundary to contain what lay before him in the porcelain bowl. Like some primitive artist working in shades of brown and waste and human leavings he stood sentinel over his unwanted canvas. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was different. This was base and real and wouldn't be contained by any artist's vision.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and in finding it gave purpose to the moment. Water rushed and swirled carrying bits and pieces to nowhere but the mass remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again with greater urgency but still it stayed, affixed to the bowl like some prehistoric creature frozen in amber.\n\nHe stood in his uniform, the green tie at his throat like a noose, feet planted wide on the tile floor of the Rite Aid bathroom. The toilet paper came away in sheets and he wrapped his hand in it like a man preparing for some grim surgery. Then bending at the waist he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into the bowels of the earth itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night stretches endless before them. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things. Not ready for the violence of speed and momentum and physics that care nothing for youth or dreams or promises made.\n\nInexperience stalks them like a predator in the dark. Rolls their machines like toys. Sends them careening off into ditches where they lay burning or bleeding or both. And they travel in packs these young ones. Always in packs. The way of their kind since time was time. Studies done in California show the truth of it. The more of them packed together the more of them die.\n\nThe state tries to control it with paper laws and curfews but these are just words written in ink that wash away in blood. Even at eighteen the hunger for danger lives in their bones like a parasite. Some doctor named Zuckerman he studied it. Wrote about how they chase the thrill of it like addicts chase the needle. And now more are coming. Children of the boomers. Millions of them. Ready to take the wheel.\n\nThey talk about fixing it. About schools teaching them and permits that say when they can drive and when they cant. Like you can control death with bureaucracy. Make it wait its turn. They want national laws now. As if the reaper cares about state lines. As if metal and momentum recognize borders drawn by men in offices far away.\n\nNone of this is new. The road has always taken its toll and always will. The young have always died on it and always will. That's the nature of speed and steel and youth. The nature of a world that don't care how many summers you've seen or how many you thought you had left to see.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though the name meant little to those afflicted. A darkness in the mind where sounds go to die or become twisted things unrecognizable from their original form. Not deafness no. The ears work as God intended but somewhere in the labyrinth of gray matter the meaning gets lost like a traveler in some vast desert with no landmarks to guide him home.\n\nThe disorder existed before men put a name to it. In the middle of the last century they began to study it. Italian doctors with names like prayers - Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. They developed their tests and their methods while across the ocean Kimura worked on his own solutions like some medieval alchemist searching for gold in lead. In seventy-seven they gathered, these seekers of truth, to share what little they knew of this thing that lived in the minds of children.\n\nThe manifestations came like specters in the night. A man might hear perfectly well yet be unable to tell where the sound originated as if the world itself had become unmoored from direction and space. Words might blur together like watercolors in rain. Patterns of sound that made sense to others became meaningless rhythms without form or substance. The subtle shifts in human speech that carry meaning beyond the words themselves - these too could be lost leaving only hollow shells of communication behind.\n\nThey tested for it in sterile rooms with machines that measured the invisible. Audiologists psychologists speech pathologists all with their instruments and questionnaires seeking answers in the darkness of the human mind. No single test could reveal its presence with certainty. Like tracking some mythical beast they followed its spoor through the forest of human consciousness looking for signs and markers that might betray its presence. They presented sounds in pairs and groups watching how the mind failed to separate them like a prospector sifting through river mud for precious metals that might or might not exist.",
            "They were all of them broken things. That's what I'd seen. Souls fractured and scattered like shattered glass on concrete, glinting dangerous in the sun. I knew then what I must do. The path ahead lay clear as bones bleached white in desert sand. Social work. To wade into the darkness where children huddle against walls and families eat themselves alive with poison words and harder things.\n\nThe values rode with me like old companions. Service. Respect. Ethics raw and pure as winter wind. Commitment to mend what's torn between people and to keep my own blade sharp for the work ahead. These weren't just words written in some college manual. They were blood truth.\n\nI wandered long years uncertain, watching folks try to outrun their demons. Some found the bottle. Others found worse things. I studied psychology then, trying to understand the machinery of hurt. But understanding ain't enough. Never was.\n\nThe boy came in summer. Sixteen and scared, perched on my friend's couch like a wounded bird. His parents had done things. Bad things. Dark things that leave marks deeper than skin. I went to their house next day after he called the law. Told the police my credentials, such as they were. They let me talk to the parents. Watched them squirm and lie, calling their boy manipulative, calling violence simple disputes. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nJustice is a strange thing in this world. We talk about individuals like they're precious gold but try to stamp them all the same shape. I never did take to that. Colored my hair wild as desert flowers, marked my flesh with metal, stood with the outcasts and the different ones. Fought against the darkness of racism and hate wherever it showed its teeth. Some folks call that rebellion. I call it truth.\n\nThe road ahead is dark and full of thorns, but I'll walk it anyway.

            "Sleep and its disorders lay before us like ancient riddles writ in the flesh of man. They come in forms both primary and secondary, though such distinctions matter little to those who walk the midnight hours seeking rest that will not come. There are those who study these afflictions, cataloging them in neat rows like bones in an archaeologist's tent, sorting them into categories they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, words that taste of dust and academia.\n\nThe sleepless ones. They carry their burden like a cross, dragging it through days that blur into nights that refuse to yield their peace. Primary Insomnia they call it, when sleep becomes a stranger for thirty nights or more. Its dark brother, Hypersomnia, drags its victims down into endless drowning sleep, while Narcolepsy strikes like a rattler, sudden and without mercy.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus, in the terrible machinery of the brain, neurons fire their ancient signals. They speak in tongues of orexin, these messengers of wake and sleep. The scientists, they took their mice and watched these neurons dance. GABAB receptors, they said, like gatekeepers at the edge of consciousness. When they forced these gates open with their chemicals - baclofen they called it - sleep came like a flood. The mice slept, and in their sleep they carried secrets about our own darkness.\n\nBut the truth of sleep lies deeper than receptors and neurons. It runs in bloodlines, passes from father to son like eye color or the shape of hands. When these inherited gates are broken, sleep becomes a ghost, haunting but never touching, and the sleepless ones must drag themselves through their days like wounded animals. They sit in fluorescent-lit offices, stand at assembly lines, drive their children to school, all while carrying the weight of endless waking, their eyes burning like coals in the desert of consciousness.",
            "He'd been there two and a half years or thereabouts, counting time in semesters like notches on a gun. The campus stretched vast and unforgiving before him, a concrete wilderness where souls wandered lost between buildings old as sin and new as tomorrow's promise. That first year they'd put him in East Halls, far out on the eastern edge where civilization gave way to the stadium's hulking shadow. The walk from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of sorts, twenty-five minutes through whatever hell the Pennsylvania weather chose to unleash, and it was always choosing.\n\nAn old graduate, not much older than himself but carrying the wisdom of years past, spoke of times when East Halls stood alone in a sea of empty land, like an island of brick and mortar in an ocean of nothing. Now that emptiness had been filled with the bones of progress - sports fields and buildings rising like monoliths from the earth, the Creamery and health services among them, apartment complexes circling like vultures on the periphery. The campus grew like a living thing, devouring space, making distance an enemy to be conquered.\n\nThe bicycle came as salvation. Not just the machine itself but the idea of it, the promise of freedom in two wheels and a chain. He'd heard tell of a friend who'd returned to cycling after years away, speaking of it like a man who'd found religion again. Bikes are great, the friend had said, the words carrying the weight of prophecy. For a time they weren't cool but they were always right, always true.\n\nHe lived off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bicycle had been an investment in survival. Thomas building loomed twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bike cut through time like a blade, reducing the journey to five minutes of pure velocity. Pollock Road lay between, a straight shot but treacherous, populated by wandering souls and metal beasts. Walking was for those with time to burn, and time was a currency he couldn't spare. Each day without the bike would cost him forty minutes, time multiplied across days and weeks until it became a burden too heavy to bear.",
            "They came for the machines and the money both. In the pages of his testament Huxley had seen it coming like a storm rolling across the plains of human consciousness, dark and vast and terrible. The people in his vision stood as cattle in their pens, branded with letters that marked their worth, their minds scrubbed clean of individual thought by the relentless whispers in the night. They called it conditioning. A word clean as bleached bone but beneath it lay something darker.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some pagan god of old, dispensing happiness like communion wafers, hollow and tasteless but necessary all the same. Through the lens of Marx's prophecies you could see the truth of it, written in the blood of human autonomy. Words like homogeny and reification rattled like dead men's teeth in the skull of progress.\n\nThe false consciousness lay upon them like a burial shroud. The lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, all of them marked and numbered like livestock - moved through their days in a soma-induced haze, buying and spending and rutting with mechanical precision. They knew nothing of their chains. The Alphas and Betas watched from their towers of privilege, knowing but not speaking, seeing but not acting. Bernard alone stood witness, though his testimony fell on ears stopped with cotton and comfort.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. The characters moved through their assigned roles like marionettes, strings pulled by unseen hands. The men spoke of women as if describing machinery - pneumatic, functional, interchangeable parts in the great engine of society. The women catalogued their couplings like accountants tallying figures in a ledger. Each caste accepted their place with the quiet resignation of the damned, consuming their allotted pleasures, obeying their prescribed commandments, walking in lockstep toward some horizon they could neither see nor understand.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam. The walls were white and clean like bones bleached in the desert sun. Men and women argued whether this faith carried violence in its heart. The question echoes still, louder now than before, like thunder rolling across empty plains.\n\nSince the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens changed their tune. First with venom and spite then with a sweetness that seemed false as a serpent's smile. Strange days these are when a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale sits heavy in my hands. Words that dont match the blood-soaked history I know. They tell of a gentle man but history whispers different truths. In the old stories he rode with sword and flame, making converts of the conquered. Yet here in these pages he walks humble and meek, waiting for men to find truth in his words like water in the desert.\n\nThe writers laid their words careful as trappers setting snares. They painted miracles that mirror the Christ's own works. Mutton and milk multiplied like loaves and fishes. A mockery. They stole the holy stories and dressed them in different clothes, thinking none would notice the theft.\n\nThey built their truth on whispers. One man telling another who told another still, like wind carrying dust across empty places. Each story passed through many mouths before finding paper, and truth has a way of changing shape when it travels so far.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they made him holy. Gentle. Wise. But history carries darker truths, written in blood and steel. I wonder if the faithful know what darkness sleeps in their prophet's past, what violence birthed their faith. Some truths are better left in shadow, but they have a way of finding light.",
            "They cast off his teachings like old clothes. Left them there in the dust of time while the world spun on and men spoke of things they knew nothing about. The truth of it was simple enough. Christianity had wandered far from where it began, like some nomadic tribe lost in the wasteland, each generation straying further from the path until they forgot there ever was one.\n\nNow the world turns different. Progressive they call it. The old ones still cling to their ways like driftwood in a flood but their numbers grow thin and their voices grow weak. There's a awakening coming. Like thunder rolling across the plains. People wanting to strip away the layers of doctrine built up like rust on iron, wanting to find what lies beneath. Might take years. Might take centuries. Don't matter none. It'll come just the same.\n\nThey'll peel back time like the skin of some ancient fruit. Layer by layer. Until there ain't nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about what God wanted. When it comes it'll sweep through like wildfire. Through the cities and the towns. Through the old world and the new. The church'll still stand but it'll be different. Like a house stripped down to its bones.\n\nWhere there was many there'll be one. Where there was difference there'll be sameness. It's happened before. Rome hunted Christians like wolves then bent its knee to the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up and up comes down.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading from some ledger but like reading smoke signals against the sky. Looking for meaning behind meaning.\n\nBack before all this there was only the Jews. Back when Rome first marched into Jerusalem like they owned it. Sixty-three years before the birth of Christ. The Jews weren't one people then neither. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. Common folk. All of them different as night and day but all reading from the same book. One God. One truth. One holy text. That's how it started.",
            "There aint no mercy in the hearts of men. The Jungle shows us this truth plain as day and black as night. Deep in their cores men harbor only greed and self-preservation, a darkness that spreads like poison through their veins. They look not below them save to crush what lies beneath their boots.\n\nYou see it clearest in them factory owners and their kind. They build their empires on broken backs and spilled blood, caring nothing for the cost. Their ambitions rise like great black monoliths against the dying sky, and Sinclair writes of it thus: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries with it the dreams and lives of thousands, drifting off into nothingness while the masters count their coins.\n\nThese men care nothing for the destruction they wrought. Not for the poisoned earth nor the fouled waters running thick with offal from their killing floors. The air itself turned rank with the stench of progress, and still they pushed on, driven by that ancient hunger that knows no satisfaction.\n\nTheir workers was nothing more than cattle to them. Expendable. Replaceable. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair called it, where \"no man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till his bones cracked then cast him aside like a spent shell casing, no more thought given than to the hogs they butchered.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown knew no salvation. No law protected them, no angel watched over their suffering. The unions that claimed to be their salvation was nothing but vultures picking at the same corpse. They was slaves in all but name, bound not by chains but by poverty and desperation. \"Here is a population,\" the truth rings out, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" And so it was, and so it remains, the dark heart of man beating its terrible rhythm through the ages.",
            "They say Dreamland was one of them poems Poe held dear above the others. Like a father with his favorite child. In it he wrote of Thulé, that word appearing twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, and Mabbott in his wisdom traced it back to Virgil who spoke of some forsaken island past Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there was something else. Something closer. The German scribes had caught Poe's eye and held it.\n\nThe truth of it lay in how Poe knew Goethe's work, deep and terrible. Arndt, in his scholarly wanderings through Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, saw the ghost of one in the other, like a man recognizing his own reflection in muddy water.\n\nOxford tells us Goethe was a giant among men who birthed Faust into the world in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in 1832 when death finally claimed him. Hidden in that second part was \"The King of Thulé,\" a dark tale of a king whose queen passed leaving him naught but a goblet. He drank deep of his grief until the cup overflowed with tears and memory. When his time came he gave away all he owned save that cursed vessel. Walked to the edge of the world and cast it into the hungry sea before closing his eyes one final time. That king and the wraith in Dreamland might have been brothers, both shaped by loss and drink and darkness.\n\nGrattan took Faust and made it his own in 1842, not a year before Poe wrote of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Like blood calling to blood. Twice Poe conjured Thule in his writings, once in Pendulum and twice more in Dreamland like bookends holding up worlds of shadow. Read them together, Goethe's King and Poe's Dreamland, and you'll see the same darkness reflected. The speaker walks through places where color goes to die, where ghosts of dead friends whisper on the wind, where loneliness has made its kingdom. Just as Goethe's king walked through his own private hell after his queen's passing.\n\nPoe knew Goethe as sure as night knows day, if only through Tennyson whom he praised like a prophet. But there were other ways Goethe's words might have found him, carried on the winds of countless retellings after the master's death.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than any statute writ by men in their towers of concrete and steel. In the florescent-lit aisles of D&D Markets the applesauce spread like some viscous harbinger, a portent of what was to come while Martin sat in his office eating his dinner with the same methodical indifference that marked all his days.\n\nThey had told him twice. Wayne first and then Haddigan quarter hour later, their voices carrying the same warning through the stale store air but Martin had dismissed them both with words that hung like lead in the empty space between them. Didn't have time for customer complaints, he'd said, though time was all there was and all there ever would be.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if the world had been waiting for just such a moment. Her body twisted and broke against the hard tile floor like something preordained, her spine crackling with a sound like dry kindling. The fifth such falling that year, or perhaps the sixth, as if the store itself had developed a taste for broken bodies and spilled blood.\n\nThe question before the court was one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether Martin's disregard carried within it that special kind of darkness the law calls malice. The California code spoke of oppression and fraud and malice like ancient runes carved in legal stone, demanding proof of despicable conduct or willing disregard for the safety of others. And there was something in Martin's actions that spoke to this, something in the way he sat eating while knowing what lay in wait in his aisles, knowing what had come before and what would surely come again.\n\nThe judge would see it. In the cold fluorescent light of the courtroom he would recognize that special kind of darkness that lives in men who watch others suffer while they sup, who hear warnings and turn away, who know the consequences and choose them anyway. For this was not mere negligence but something older, something that spoke to the darkness that lives in all men's hearts.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a hunger. Started when she was fourteen and hadnt left her yet. Three years gone and still it gnawed. Not a thing she needed now but someone and yet the boys who came calling stirred nothing in her heart. They made their clumsy advances like yearling colts testing weak legs but she turned from them all. She studied this emptiness like a crow picking through bones but found no answers there. Just the endless wanting and the questions that followed behind like pallbearers at a funeral that wouldnt end.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through the rooms like ghosts barely disturbing the air. No shouting. No tears. When words did rise between them and their daughter they were about her wildness, her need to run free like some unbroken mare. She carried a fire in her that burned bright against their stillness but folk took to her anyway. Something in that flame drew them close despite the risk of burning.\n\nThen came the day when quiet broke. A cry cut through the morning air sharp as a blade. Kitchen way. Her mothers voice twisted into something wrong. She ran calling out mama mama but the only answer was pain wrapped in short breaths. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something fallen from a great height. Touch gentle as prayer on her mothers shoulder. Take me to the hospital child the words coming broken and scattered like birds shot from the sky. She gathered her mother up blessed now for the strength in her arms. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air was thick with death and antiseptic but she noticed none of it. Her world had narrowed to her mothers pain and the need to end it. Called out and white coats came running their faces masks of concern. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left her there in the waiting room with nothing but time and worry for company.\n\nAll this because a vase set too high needed reaching and a stepstool proved treacherous as any snake in the garden.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the stones themselves, whispered promises of longer life through the statistics. Not in words but in the absence of dead hearts, in the flowing of clean blood through untainted vessels. They called it aMed, this scoring of meals, this counting of plants and fish and the oils that men had pressed from fruit since time before memory.\n\nThe old studies spoke their piece. Numbers carved into ledgers showing how men who ate from the earth's abundance, who shunned the heavy fats of beasts, lived longer. Their hearts beat stronger. But none had looked deep into the darkness of the stroke, that silent killer that steals mind and movement alike.\n\nSeventy-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six women they watched. Nurses all of them, scattered across eleven states like seeds in the wind. For twenty years they marked their eating in questionnaires, six times from 1984 to 2004, documenting each morsel as if writing their own salvation. They were faithful in their reporting, these women, more than ninety-five in every hundred staying true to the end.\n\nThe counters of numbers verified everything. When death came they searched through papers and certificates, autopsy reports telling tales of failed hearts and blocked vessels. Some they called probable, when the papers weren't there to tell the tale. Seventeen percent of strokes, twenty-four percent of heart failures, marked down in their ledgers like notches on a gun.\n\nThey tracked everything. Weight and smoke and pills. The movement of bodies in leisure and the changes that time brings to women's flesh. The numbers spoke of protection. Those who followed the old ways, eating as their ancestors did from the Mediterranean shores, they lived longer. Two thousand three hundred ninety-one hearts failed, one thousand seven hundred sixty-three minds darkened by stroke, one thousand seventy-seven souls claimed by the combined assault. But those who ate from the earth's bounty, they stood stronger. The numbers said so. Zero point seven one, they wrote in their books. A mathematical blessing, a ward against death.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign said. Just that and nothing more upon the cardboard held aloft by the girl actor who'd once played pregnant in that picture show. She stood there in the gray morning like some soothsayer of old bearing portents and auguries.\n\nThey called it Burma though that wasnt its name no more. A land of temples and soldiers where men in ochre robes walked the streets in silence until they didnt. Until the streets ran red with their blood and the monasteries lay broken and burning in the perpetual dusk of that strange country. The government men had come up through ranks like carrion birds ascending, nineteen sixty two it was, and they ruled with iron and lead and all manner of cruelty that men devise when power fills their gullets.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Saffron Revolution they called it though revolution it wasnt, just death dealt out like playing cards in some cosmic game where the house always wins. A Japanese man with a camera lay dying in the street while they watched. Thirteen dead said the papers but the colonel who fled knew different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nThese things aint new. Since men first gathered in tribes there been those who'd rule absolute. Roman emperors who claimed kinship with gods. Japanese kings who were gods themselves. Even now our own president takes counsel from prophets and madmen who speak in tongues of power and control.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. Tiananmen where tanks rolled over students who dared to dream. Rwanda where neighbor killed neighbor until the streets stank of death. Hitler's own Reich where the crematoriums burned day and night without ceasing. All of it written in blood on pages that history turns with indifferent hands.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms long across the wasteland of jazz, not just in years but in the way he shaped and molded his orchestra like some dark craftsman at his forge. His piano work whispers through the compositions like wind through dead grass, but as architect of sound he built cathedrals of brass and wood where soloists could wander like prophets in the wilderness. He knew the voices of his men, knew them like a father knows his sons, and he wrote for their souls as much as their instruments. The framework he built was both prison and liberation, the tightly wound phrases and loose improvisations existing in the same space like light and dark at twilight.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of ancient scripture, noting how he made the human voice into something otherworldly, stripped of words and meaning save what the soul could conjure. Six times the piece turns upon itself like a serpent consuming its tail. First comes the voice, pure as spring water then rough as desert stone, calling to the reeds that answer like lost children. Then the trumpet emerges from the darkness, muted and blue as midnight, followed by the clarinet that climbs toward heaven while the piano walks beneath it like a shadow. The full band rises up like a great beast, brass and reed speaking in tongues, until the fifth turning when everything reaches toward something unseen and terrible and beautiful. In the end the voice returns, growling like some creature that has forgotten it was once human, and the trombone speaks the final dissonant words like a priest delivering last rites.\n\nA year later he conjured Hot and Bothered from the void, Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice speaking to each other like lovers in a dead language. And when It Don't Mean a Thing emerged from the darkness, Nanton's trombone spoke first, as if announcing the coming of something that could not be named. This was Ellington's way, to take the human and make it instrument, to take the brass and make it flesh, until you could no longer tell where one ended and the other began.",
            "They come to us like questions in the dark. How the beasts of field and forest take their shapes and why. What forces bind them to their forms like prisoners to their chains. In 1917 Thompson wrote of how even the learned men of science had not yet begun to speak of living things in the tongue of numbers and equations and even now his words ring true across the wasteland of years.\n\nThe shells lie before us like calcified histories. Each one a testament to some ancient geometry that we cannot name. We study them, these remnants of Prunum, these spiral tombs of the creatures that once dwelt within. We gather their ghosts through machines that peer through their walls with invisible light and we feed these spectral measurements to newer machines that speak in electricity and silicon.\n\nThe shell is a prison built by its inmate, constructed in slow circles through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of eternal return. The whorls spiral like a rope around nothing, around an axis that exists only in theory, in the mind. The columella stands sentinel at the center of it all. Each revolution grows according to some mathematical truth that we can only glimpse, like seeing shapes in smoke. The sutures mark time like notches on a prisoner's wall.\n\nWe arrange them in our taxonomies. Apical. Basal. Apertural. Abapertural. Words we use to impose order on chaos. We count the whorls like counting rings in a tree, measuring quarter turns as if such precision matters in the face of geological time. The aperture traces its path through space like a bullet through the dark, leaving behind only its calcified wake.\n\nIn the end we reduce it all to numbers. Coordinates. Trajectories. As if we could capture the essence of life in equations. As if we could understand the mind of God through mathematics. But the shells remain what they are. Silent witnesses to processes we can only pretend to comprehend.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like dark seeds in the earth, their numbers unchanging through the years, a grim testament carved in stone. The nation moved forward in some ways, meeting goals for water and clean places to shit, but the mothers and their young ones kept dying just the same, their blood seeping into soil that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey said more births now had someone who knew the old ways, seven of ten maybe, women who'd learned their craft from their mothers and grandmothers before them. But when the blood came, really came, these women stood helpless as the rest, watching life drain away in crimson rivers. Numbers on paper meant nothing to death. It took what it wanted.\n\nIn the cities they cut women open to save them, but not many. Four in hundred maybe. Out in the places where dirt roads turned to mud and electricity came and went like a fickle god, fewer still. The rich got their medicine and their doctors. The poor got their prayers. Twenty-seven percent difference between them, the bureaucrats said, as if poverty could be measured in clean decimals instead of dead children.\n\nThey argued about it in offices with air conditioning, whether to build special programs or fix the whole broken machine. Vertical approaches, they called them, like ladders to heaven. But every ladder they built seemed to steal from another, and the forms and papers multiplied like rats in a granary. Money flowed to AIDS while babies died of diarrhea, and the doctors chased the dollars like crows following a plow. Nothing changed except the numbers on the reports, and those numbers were written in blood.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, spreading like windblown seed across the land until no man could count its varieties. And these varieties bred new varieties and those bred still more until the names themselves became a babel of confusion. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning children darker and stranger than their fathers.\n\nAmong these bastard sons none grew more twisted and manifold than the thing they called Heavy Metal. It came slouching out of the darkness forty years ago and in its wake followed legions. Each new breed carrying some mark of its sire but warped and changed like creatures born in atomic fire. The darkness in it spoke to something in men's souls and they took it and shaped it to their own designs, each new shaping breeding yet more shapes until the very thing that spawned them all became impossible to name.\n\nNow the metal walks among us in countless forms, like some demon that can wear any face it chooses. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, back to the source of the darkness. For metal aint just music. It's a movement born in shadow and raised on blood and thunder.\n\nThey made it louder, heavier, more violent than what came before. The players were virtuosos of chaos, their instruments howling like the damned. And there were drugs, yes. In those mid-seventies years when the psychedelics flowed like water and men's minds turned to strange horizons. They made records that sound like dispatches from hell itself, blame it on the drugs if you want but the darkness was there already, waiting. The pretty music of those days couldn't speak to what was coming. But metal could. Metal did. Like some dark reflection of the Romantic composers of old, it reached into the shadows of men's souls and pulled forth something terrible and true.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own. The dreams came to him like thieves in the night and he put them down with careful strokes as if marking the passage of something ancient and terrible. The Dream they called it. Nineteen hundred and ten. A woman lost in some savage paradise while beasts with eyes like burning coals watched from the darkness of the jungle. But the real dream was his own and it gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition. Acceptance. The approval of men who painted in ways he could not understand but desperately wished to join.\n\nHe was born to a tinsmith in Laval where the spring rains fell hard against the slate roofs and the streets ran with mud. No teacher ever showed him how to hold a brush or mix colors or capture the light that fell across the world like God's own thoughts. For forty years he collected tolls from travelers while the art lived inside him like some trapped animal trying to claw its way free. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. His first wife Clémence died and took eight babies with her to the cold ground leaving only Julia behind. The grief sat in him like lead and he turned to painting like a man turns to whiskey, hoping to drown something that cannot be drowned.\n\nHe worked in the shadow of giants. While Matisse and the others carved their names into history with wild colors and shapes that defied God's own design Rousseau labored in his simple way trying to make pictures that would please the men who decided such things. Matisse feared convention like it was a poison but Rousseau sought it like salvation. Two men walking different roads in the same dark wood. One running from what the other was running toward.\n\nThe folk painters heart beat in him true as any clock. He painted what he knew and what he dreamed and what he feared all at once and the pictures came out strange and wonderful though he never meant them to be. His dreams of acceptance lay in him like stones but the pictures that came from his hands were something else entirely. Something wild. Something true.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road. Been that way since before any living soul drew breath. Keats knew it when he wrote them words about the urn, beauty being truth and truth being all we need know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but the knowing of right and wrong, the seeing of what's beautiful, that comes from somewhere deeper. Like an old well that ain't got no bottom.\n\nYou can study it all you want. Write down rules about what makes something right or pretty. But they're just words on paper, trying to catch smoke in your hands. Take that painting, the Mona Lisa. Folk talk about shadow and light, about what was happening in Italy back then, but that ain't really it. When someone loves a thing, really loves it, first words out their mouth is always something like \"there's just something about it.\" Rest comes after, like trying to explain why you love your momma.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things can only be told in stories because regular talk won't do. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who ain't never drunk none. Same goes for knowing right from wrong. Wittgenstein said ethics can't be spoke of proper, and he wasn't wrong. There's something in both art and right living that sits beyond words, like a far-off mountain you can see but never reach.\n\nWay I figure it, that's why stories and morals run so close together, like two streams joining in the valley. They both hit us somewhere deep, somewhere we can feel but can't point to. Literature especially. McKean had it right when he said books carry moral weight same as life does. Can't live without choosing between right and wrong, and can't tell stories without doing the same. That's what makes them matter. That's what makes them true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like a sentinel, unified and stark against the heavens, its essence flowing from the shadow-kept valleys of München where the alps loom black and ancient to the cold waters of Kiel where the Baltic meets the shore in eternal conflict. This essence, this blood-memory, courses through the veins of cities from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep and merciless, through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe winds like a steel serpent through Saxon stone. And in this land where darkness and light wage their endless war, the roots run deep into soil watered by the blood of tribes long forgotten.\n\nGermania. The word itself carries weight like old bones in the earth. Men argue its meaning like crows fighting over carrion, each pecking at truth with black beaks. Tacitus, that Roman who peered into the darkness beyond the empire's reach, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with fire and steel, becoming Germans in the crossing. Caesar too marked them in his writings, ink flowing like blood across parchment as he recorded their raids, their savage dance across borders that meant nothing to them. The word itself perhaps meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls, or maybe it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, death-dealer in the hands of warriors. Or perhaps it rose from garim, a scream in the Old Irish night, for these were a people who made the darkness echo with their war-cries.\n\nTacitus wrote of them as if writing of wolves or winter storms, creatures born of the land itself. Not mixed with others, he said, for who would choose such wilderness, such brutal skies, such a land that wore its hostility like a crown? The Germans were aboriginal, sprung from soil and ice and darkness.\n\nThe Romans came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry, leading their legions into the depths of Germania only to retreat again to their marble cities and heated baths. And the Germans remained, trading with the empire that feared them, serving in its armies while keeping their own savage hearts. They dwelt in the borderlands like shadows at the edge of firelight, taking what they needed from the land and from Rome itself, patient as winter, eternal as the forests that bore them.",
            "In the dark heart of Twelfth Night there dwells a truth about masks and the wearing of them, how they serve their purpose like a knife serves its wielder but in time will turn against the flesh that holds them. The shedding of such guises becomes necessary lest the wearer lose themselves to the void that lies between what is and what seems to be. But there aint no easy way to cast off what's become a second skin and them that's been deceived may turn cold as winter stone or hot as desert fury when the truth comes calling.\n\nThe matter of gender masquerade carries its own peculiar burden, like a snake that eats its own tail, forever asking why. Why does the soul seek to shed its given form and take up another? Viola speaks plain enough about it: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang in the air like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nShe come to these foreign shores alone and afraid and took up man's clothing like armor against the world's malice. But such protection carries its own poison. It sets her apart from her own kind, leaves her to walk alone among women who might have been sisters to her. And Olivia, God help her, sees in Viola's disguise what she wants to see, calling out \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words fall like dead birds from her lips. And there's Orsino too, speaking words that cut like broken glass: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nMaybe them that read these words now might see something deeper, like looking into a well at midnight. Maybe they'd say this tale shows how lies can sometimes midwife truth into the world, especially in Olivia and Orsino's case. Their desires lay buried like bones in the desert until Viola's deception dug them up. Some might wonder if Olivia's heart truly yearned for women all along, but that aint likely what Shakespeare meant. More like he was mocking them that judge love by its container rather than its contents.\n\nYou can see it clear as day when Olivia turns her affections from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a rattler strikes, and speaks to Viola like blood kin: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words ring true at last, like a bell in the darkness that finally finds its proper tone.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in whispers. Of cruelties visited upon the Ovaherero and the Nama peoples in that sunscorched land they called South West Africa. But empires aint built on simple tales and the Germans ruled different lands different ways and some flourished while others withered beneath the weight of their governance.\n\nIn the east where the British come to rule in 1919 they found natives who could read and write and cipher numbers like educated men. Same in Kamerun where even the white men spoke well of what the Germans had done. But South West Africa was different. Something darker there.\n\nThe missionaries come with their books and their crosses but the government gave them nothing. No help. No coin. While the white children got their schools built fine with government money and the mission schools for whites got what they needed too. These things cast long shadows and while other colonies had natives who could read and write and make their way in the white man's world South West Africa remained in darkness. Its people untouched. Unlearned. Unable to read the very papers that marked their fate.\n\nMen wrote about these things. German men mostly, in the early days of the century, putting down in their own tongue what they saw in these far places. Later others come. English speakers who looked at how different colonies fared different fates. Cohen was one. He wrote about the schools in South West Africa and East Africa both, trying to make sense of why one flourished while the other failed. He said it was the settlers that made the difference. Too many whites in South West Africa wanting to keep things their way.\n\nThe land there wasnt like the other colonies. Not so hot. Not so wet. Desert mostly but liveable if you were white and determined. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had made it their home while East Africa, the next most settled place, had barely five thousand. They come for the temperate air and the promise of mastery over the land and its people. And master it they did.",
            "They rode forth across that contested earth, these two nations, like ancient enemies bound by blood and soil. From 1836 to 1893 they circled each other like wounded wolves, fifty-seven years of malice carved into the very ground beneath them. The war came in 1846, as wars do, and the American forces descended upon Mexico like locusts, stripping away Texas and the Southwest territories, leaving behind nothing but dust and memory.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all neighbors cursed by proximity they found in each other a mirror of their own fears, their own hatreds. Their differences ran deep as burial grounds - God and custom and the old ways setting them apart like oil and water in a jar. Cuba too stood watching from across the water, another thorn in the American flesh, while the rest of Latin America kept its distance, wise perhaps in its caution.\n\nReligion lay between them like a rusted blade. The Protestant Americans carried their prejudices from the old world, wearing their distrust of Catholics like armor, just as their English forebears had done. The Spanish shadow fell long across Mexico, and in its darkness old hatred grew like weeds in untended fields.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those bitter years, mostly over the border that cut through the land like a scar. Bandits and murderers moved across it like ghosts, striking at towns on both sides, until finally both nations sent their armies to stand watch over that invisible line. The rivalry died slow, like all ancient things must die, when Mexico fell into the economic embrace of its northern neighbor, American ambition turning from land to money, as it always does in the end.\n\nThe old ways changed. The old blood dried. But the memory remained, etched into the stones and the sand and the bones of all those who died in that time when two nations stared across a line drawn in dust, each seeing in the other a darkness they feared in themselves.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before it took me.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some hollow need for safety, the kind that gets bred into you when you're young and afraid. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always be dying or trying not to. So I buried deeper things, dreams of science and truth-telling, and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThere I was at forty-six. Alone. No money to speak of and work become impossible as breath to a hanged man. Fifteen years living on government alms and now nothing remains that's truly mine. Each day comes like a thief in the night, stealing what little security remains. Nothing certain anymore except this one truth: that without my blood kin and the few true friends, I'd have been gone to dust. When the real darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense of strength.\n\nLife's got its catastrophes waiting, big and small like wolves in the night. No matter how you prepare some storms are too big to weather alone. Ain't no guarantee written in stone or sky.\n\nThe government's basket's got holes and the bottom's falling out, sure as sunrise. But better we learn to trust each other again than each man digging his own grave in the backyard calling it shelter. They talk about rugged individualism like it built this nation, but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing was mercy and respect and the sharing of what little they had. Them wagon trains didn't cross the mountains one by one.\n\nSo lay in your stores. Keep your matches dry and your water clean. Stack your canned goods like gold bars if you want. Plant your garden if the earth'll have you. But while you're doing all that surviving, remember your neighbor's light in the window. Might be the only thing between you and the dark when it comes.",
            "He was born a prince in the old world, in times when men still believed the earth was flat and the heavens hung low like a tapestry of black velvet studded with cold fire. They would later call him Buddha. The years counted backward twenty five hundred times since then, since he walked away from wealth and crown to seek what lay beyond the veil of human suffering. What he found became Buddhism and the Theravada followed, pure as mountain water, orthodox as stone.\n\nThe thing that was then aint the thing that is now. In Sri Lanka they cut water once each year, monks and common folk gathered like dark birds at the edge of sacred pools, performing rituals the Buddha never spoke of. Time changes all things. Even truth. Even doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist folk, them that wear robes and them that dont, have watched their beliefs shift like sand in desert winds, pushed by forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all but bringing change regardless.\n\nWords matter here. Internal is what comes from inside the Buddhasasana, be it monk or layman that brings it. External is all else, the outsider, the stranger, the other. Some forces come with teeth bared and claws extended, seeking to tear down what Buddha built. These are hostile. Others come blank-faced and indifferent, neither meaning good nor ill, though they may bring either. These are benign. Remember these words. They'll come again.\n\nThe heart of it all beats steady beneath. Three jewels they seek refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient words. Suttas telling tales and teachings. Vinaya speaking law. Abhidhamma reaching into the spaces between spaces where metaphysics dwell. They speak of Anatta, the great emptiness where soul should be. Of Dukkha, the suffering that runs through all things like dark threads through pale cloth. Of Anicca, how nothing lasts, nothing stays, nothing holds. Know these and you might break free of Sansara, that wheel that turns and turns, grinding life into death into life again. Break free of want and hate and the fog that clouds mens minds. The Vinaya tells how to live. Five rules for common folk: kill not, lie not, steal not, keep your loins in check, stay clear of drink and drugs that cloud the mind. Monks got more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all stand four truths like stone pillars holding up the sky. Life is suffering. Want brings suffering. Suffering can end."
