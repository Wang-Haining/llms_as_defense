            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

And if you find yourself in strange territory, respect for their ways is the only currency worth trading.\n\nBut culture ain't just about borders drawn on maps.

            "The fool speaks of godlessness and the words fall dead upon the earth like leaves in winter.

His argument coils around itself saying that God exists in understanding and therefore must exist in truth for how can the mind conceive that which cannot be. The words themselves twisted and gnarled as ancient trees but the heart of it beats steady: truth lies within the soul itself needing no outside proof. This is what men call faith though the word itself has been worn smooth by too many tongues.\n\nAquinas walked a different road. His path marked by signposts of reason and empirical truth like bone markers in a wasteland. He would build his case on foundations of stone not sand believing God could be proven through pure logic alone requiring no leap of faith across the chasm of doubt. Five arguments he laid out like five fingers of a hand reaching toward heaven: change causation contingency degrees of excellence harmony. Each one a thread in a tapestry of reason showing God's existence as necessary as breath to life. Like a man knowing the shape of a missing piece in a puzzle by the void it leaves behind.\n\nThe two paths wind through different territories but seek the same destination.

            "Writers lay their words like traps. Each one a snare set to catch some feeling or truth that prowls the darkness of mens minds. Some catch better than others. Fitzgerald he knew the way of such things when he wrote his tale of Gatsby. He would take words that had no business being together and wed them like strange desert creatures coupling in the night. Or he would take a thing, simple as it was, and make it speak for something else entirely. Colors were his chosen tokens. Gold and green and white and gray and red like old blood dried in the sun. In The Great Gatsby these colors became more than what they were. White and gray and shades of pink became messengers carrying whispers of meaning through the pages.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness, of things worn down by time and circumstance until they were all one thing. White carried itself higher, wore better clothes, spoke with practiced words. Gray was its poor relation, faded and tired and used up. Fitzgerald scattered these like bones in a dead land. Everywhere the white showed itself. Daisy and Jordan forever wrapped in white like ghosts haunting the edges of sight. Nick in his white flannels moving through Gatsby's carnival of excess. Tom buttoned up in white when he went to his woman. Catherine with her skin powdered white as desert salt. Only at Gatsby's gathering did the white give way, there where the walls blazed with colors crude as fresh kill.\n\nThe meaning sank deeper. The writer cast his net of white and gray across all common things. The canyons of New York stood white and dead as bleached bones. The names of Gatsby's people faded to gray marks on paper. Apartment buildings lined up like slices of white bread. Plain folk wore the colors like a uniform. Jordan and Daisy's youth was white as morning frost. The valley of ashes bore its gray cars and gray earth like a curse. Even the child by the tracks and the old man with his dogs wore gray like a second skin.\n\nThen Fitzgerald turned these colors into weapons. When Daisy appears again she comes dressed in white, driving white, becoming not a woman but a thing uniform and empty as blown smoke. A prize Gatsby chased across the years.

Small farms struggling against the giants with their machines and their economies of scale. But the land remembers what it was before, and some try to help it remember better. They plant cover crops and move their cattle in patterns old as the seasons. They pull the invasive plants that would choke out what belongs.\n\nThe parcel lies near Potrero, pressed against the Cleveland National Forest like a child against its mother. One hundred and sixty acres of chaparral and grassland brought over from the Mediterranean, oak trees that have watched centuries pass beneath their branches. The government men have their lists of creatures they want to save - the kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog, butterflies with names like epitaphs, the California gnatcatcher singing its song to empty skies.\n\nBefore the white men came with their cattle and their axes to cut cordwood, the Indians walked these hills. How many generations passed through this land, their footsteps worn into paths now lost? The homesteaders came after, claiming their patent on land that never knew it could be owned. They grazed their cattle and cut their wood and the land endured, as it endures still.",
            "Blood runs deep twixt brothers and aint no force in heaven or hell can break such bonds. Within that blood dwells love and pride and jealousy and cruelty like ancient spirits writhing in darkness. Brothers know each other in ways no other souls can know and when they look upon each other they see their own self reflected back like some dark mirror of truth. When the world turns black as pitch and circumstances dire thats when the true nature of brotherhood shows itself whether it be righteous or damned. These revelations carry a terrible cost like some old testament debt that must be paid in full. To understand the emotions that spring from shared blood is to shoulder the burden of their consequences. When brother looks upon brother they see not what others might see but what truly dwells in their hearts black or otherwise.\n\nIn the tale of the crimson bird two brothers walked this path through all its fury and pain. They moved through a world of decaying beauty where cypress knees broke the water like bones of the drowned and spanish moss hung like funeral shrouds. Their journey was doomed from the start like some biblical parable of pride and fallibility. When pride crashed against disappointment only one would walk away breathing while the other would join the earth and roots and water. The story speaks through the elder brother and his view of a world both beautiful and merciless where pride drives men to terrible acts. His feelings for his crippled brother Doodle twisted like kudzu round his heart choking whatever love might grow there.\n\nThe older brother's pride ran deep as an artesian well poisoned at its source. From their first steps together till their last he carried resentment for Doodle like original sin. He'd dreamed of teaching someone to hold breath underwater and climb the twisted vines in Old Woman Swamp and race through the pinelands to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle came into the world marked by god or devil with a heart weak as water. The brother's dreams shattered like clay pots dropped on stone and in his darkness he thought on smothering the child with a pillow but for a smile that pierced his black intentions like sunlight through storm clouds. That smile spoke of something deeper than blood something that even pride couldn't fully poison.",
            "The mind of man it is a thing of terrible complexity, a machine of creation and destruction both. Time was when men likened it to tablets of wax, then to sheets of ancient papyrus, then to bound volumes, and now in these latter days to machines that compute. But these are only shadows cast upon shadows, and the truth of the mind eludes such simple tellings.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and bleeding. Touch and heat and sound and light, all transformed by flesh into something the brain can read like old signs in the desert. The mind works its algorithms like a butcher works meat, bottom to top and top to bottom again. Take the black box sitting in whiteness. The bottom-working mind sees first the color and the edges where darkness meets light, while the top-working mind already knows what boxes are and makes the seeing faster, though sometimes it lies to itself about whether the box is truly there or if it's just a hole cut in the white.\n\nThere's a sentinel in the mind that sorts what matters from what don't. Like a man standing guard at a door, letting some thoughts pass and turning others away. Your feet might crush a thousand blades of grass but the guard won't let you count them. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room will reach your ears like a bullet finding its mark. The guard works always, sorting and resorting what comes through.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments, some fresh as new-dug graves, others ancient as bone. The mind takes what it sees and hears and marks it like a rancher brands cattle. Words get marked three ways - by their shape like tracks in sand, by their sound like echo in canyon walls, and by their meaning like old stories passed down. Some memories live brief as mayflies, dancing their twenty seconds in electric circles through the brain. Others bed down deep in the protein and sinew, making homes in the flesh itself.\n\nThey say knowledge is stored like a web of iron strings, each thought connected to others by rust-worn cables of meaning. Chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on until the web spreads out like the highways of some mad god's kingdom. But these are just stories we tell ourselves in the dark, trying to make sense of the machinery behind our eyes.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets turned belly up like dead fish in a poisoned stream, the bones of American enterprise bleaching under a merciless economic sun. Men who had built empires of paper and promise watched them scatter like autumn leaves in a cold wind. The unemployment came first, then the houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing, their owners gone like ghosts into the gathering dark.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in older times, in the days when Clinton held court in the white house. The man had wanted power like all men want power and he had loosened the bonds that held the money-lenders in check. They came like locusts then, these bankers with their papers and their promises, offering salvation in the form of loans to those who had no means to pay them back. Fannie Mae and her twisted sister Freddie Mac danced to this tune, packaging poison as medicine, selling death as life.\n\nThe mortgages they crafted were strange beasts, chimeras with many heads and poisoned teeth. They called them adjustable-rate, called them securities, called them obligations, but they were snares all the same. The people mortgaged their futures and their children's futures, building houses of cards in a windstorm, never seeing the darkness gathering at the edges of their dreams.\n\nWhen the storm came it came with the fury of an old testament god. The great houses of money fell like dominoes in the night. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold their souls for copper pennies. Lehman Brothers vanished like smoke. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley bent their proud necks to the government's yoke. Five trillion dollars of debt hung like a millstone around the neck of the nation, and the government gathered up the broken pieces of Fannie and Freddie like a parent collecting the remains of wayward children.\n\nThey had built their house upon sand, and when the tide came in it washed away all their certainties, leaving only ruin and regret in its wake.",
            "The exposition comes like a thief in the night. Silent and unwanted. Writers who fancy themselves gods of their craft spread their wings like broken angels thinking their words will lift them to some heaven of prose but there aint no such place. Only the quiet damnation of readers who curse your name into the dark of their screens and turn away forever.\n\nThe old doctor would rail against such things. Screaming at pages filled with nothing but words that mean nothing. Information spilled like blood on sand. Useless. Gone.\n\nShow dont tell. That's what they say. But the devil rides both shoulders whispering sweet poison. Tell them everything, he says. Tell them of histories that dont matter. Tell them of childhoods long dead. Tell them until there aint nothing left to tell.\n\nExposition is just words about other words. In the moving pictures they got folk telling other folk things that dont need telling. Like that old mariner with his endless tale. In books its worse. Writers become preachers of their own gospel.\n\nTake the story of a woman and her dead man. You could say they met and loved and married and he died. You could say it quick like that. But where's the truth in it. Where's the way his eyes caught the light when he looked at her. Where's the sound of her laugh when he told them fool jokes of his. Where's the way the bullet took him. The way she screamed. The way the blood looked black in the moonlight. That's the meat of it. That's what makes it real.\n\nSometimes a writer wants to tell you everything about a man. That he flew planes in some war. That he works nights at a gas station now. That he been married twice but got no kids to show for it. That he likes to fish and dreams of owning that station someday. That he ate some fancy eggs this morning. But what good is knowing all that if you dont know the man himself. If you cant see the weight of all them failed dreams in his eyes. If you cant smell the gasoline on his clothes. If you cant feel the loneliness eating at him like rust on an old chain.",
            "The morning came dark and cold across the Ohio plains and with it the news of violence that plagues all men. On the screen they showed a man's face, hollow-eyed and vengeful, one Shad Hostettler who had taken blade to wife in Ashley. The newsmen spoke little of it, their words sparse as winter wheat, moving on like carrion birds to fresh killing grounds.\n\nThey told of a boy shot down in Sharon Woods, Travis Buyers by name, eighteen years on this earth before the bullets found him. The SWAT men moved through the streets like black-clad prophets but found nothing. The boy was black and the news passed over him quick as a shadow, the way it always does with such folk, while white victims draw the cameras like moths to flame, their stories told and retold until they echo through the empty spaces of the morning broadcasts.\n\nA tale came then of a flying machine, a mercy ship pierced by lead, the small caliber round having punched through its metal skin like judgment from below. Five thousand dollars promised for the shooter's name, though such men rarely come forward in the light.\n\nThe weatherman spoke of rain and thunder, his words a incantation against the coming storm, the numbers of degrees meaningless in the face of what nature would bring.\n\nThey showed footage of a robbery, dwelling overlong on the darkness of the perpetrator's skin as if evil wore only one shade. Six foot tall they said he was, wearing death's own hood, moving through the UDF store like a specter of want.\n\nLast came the story of Rodriguez, a Mexican who'd moved plants north for profit until the law caught him. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if counting it slow made the time more real. His heritage they mentioned like it was a crime itself, though drugs know nothing of borders or blood.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like some spectral thing through the markets tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets that men have fashioned from numbers and dreams. It trades like stock but carries within it multitudes. Like some dark promise it offers what mutual funds cannot - the ability to sell short and buy on margin and purchase but a single share should that be all you possess.\n\nThe benefits lay there like bleached bones in the financial desert, stark and undeniable. Lower expense ratios than any mutual fund could claim. Yet darkness lurks at the edges for there are commissions to be paid, blood money for every trade like some ancient toll to cross the river of commerce.\n\nThey come in endless varieties these ETFs, each one different from the last but all bound by the same rules, the same principles that govern their existence. A man might question whether the benefits they tout - diversification chief among them - are real or merely mirages shimmering in the heat of market speculation.\n\nWe set our sights on one called IHF, to parse its essence against the ten largest holdings within it. To determine if owning the one could match owning the many, or if some better configuration might exist, like finding a new path through old territory.\n\nThe task demanded focus. To include every holding would be to lose oneself in a maze of numbers. So we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of the whole, like taking the measure of a man by his strongest features.\n\nThe calculations stretched before us like a map of some ancient territory, each figure a landmark in understanding how these ten stocks stood in for the whole of IHF. We normalized their percentages to 100, as if adjusting a compass to true north, and measured their contributions to Beta and Return as if weighing gold on scales.\n\nThe numbers spoke clear as desert stars - the return of the ten exceeded the ETF by 6.11 percent, a difference of 16 percent in total. The Beta ran lower by .12, like tracking softer footprints in the sand. Yet questions remained about whether these differences carried true statistical weight, or were merely phantoms in the financial wilderness.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter itself had reached in and torn the heart from our endeavor. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough. The New England cold come down like judgment, driving the bicycles to their hooks and the walkers to their cars, but that wasnt all of it. Not by half. December brought its own demons - papers to grade and tests to mark and the whole machinery of education grinding toward semester's end. The log books lay forgotten like dead leaves.\n\nThe holiday season stretched out before them all like some dark road with no end in sight. Students scattered like quail to their homes, faculty too, the campus standing empty and dead beneath the winter sky. When they returned in January the cold had settled deep in the bones of the earth and February showed no mercy neither. You could say the project started with fire in its belly but fire needs feeding and we had let it die down to embers. We conjured up what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, like some carnival medicine show come to town, and it worked after a fashion. The numbers rose again but the truth of it was we were fighting more than just the seasons and the academic calendar. We were fighting time itself and time always wins.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. The car is freedom and freedom runs in the blood like whiskey. We tried to tempt them away with prizes. Gift cards for coffee and food, massages, books. But a man or woman behind the wheel of their own automobile is like God himself deciding when and where to go and that's a hard thing to trade for a free lunch. Later we wondered if bigger prizes might have turned the tide. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars with their silent engines and their promise of virtue. If we had played it different, saved the big prizes for when the winter came down and the spirit flagged, maybe the numbers would have told a different story. But maybes are like prayers - sometimes they get answered and sometimes they just drift away on the wind.",
            "I sat there in the dim light watching them old Edison reels spin, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901, all of them trick films they called them. Magic made of light and shadow and lies. The illusions danced across the screen like specters from some forgotten carnival, each one bound by rules old as theatre itself.\n\nThey were prison films in their way, trapped in boxes of their own making. Set-bound and frontal like some ancient proscenium arch in a dead man's playhouse. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, bearing testament to the conjurer's craft through long shots and medium frames, each film a singular moment stretched thin across time's cruel axis.\n\nYet some of them, those that came with the turning of the century, they dared. They broke free of their chains, splitting themselves into multiple shots like some cinematic hydra.\n\nThe stage held them all, these phantoms. Interior sets built like coffins for the living, the camera fixed and staring like death itself. No following of figures here, no chase through depths of field. This was vaudeville's bastard child, born in the womb of magic shows and carnival tents. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, side to side, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900, they shuffled across the frame like condemned men, entering stage right, moving in their horizontal dance of the damned.\n\nThe proscenium arch was their master and their god. Long shots and medium shots were its prophets, but close-ups were heresy, forbidden fruit in this garden of illusions. Like theatre-goers of old, we watched from afar, never permitted to breach that sacred distance between performer and witness.\n\nOne shot, one film. That was the law of their world, binding these spectral performances to mere minutes of life. Stories were sparse things here, stripped down to base trickery - disappearances, transformations, the stuff of street corner magicians and carnival barkers. But even in these simple deceptions lay deeper truths. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, birthed in 1895, hid its secrets in plain sight. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the lie, where Mary's head wasn't Mary's head at all, though to the innocent eye it all flows like water over stone, one continuous stream of terrible truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a paradox of time itself, like bones bleached white in the desert sun yet still holding the marrow of life within. Ian Watt called it what it was, this thing that breathed both old and fresh air, praised and damned in the same breath by those who would judge such things. They spoke of its emptiness while others saw in it something terrible and sublime, like Burke did, though perhaps he knew not what darkness truly dwelt there.\n\nWhen Walpole birthed The Castle of Otranto into this world he did what no man had done before, taking the ancient romances and the modern ones too and binding them together with blood and ink and shadow. He reached back into the theater of old times, into the stone and mortar of medieval walls, into traditions that lay like dead things but weren't dead at all. The word gothic itself had wandered like a vagrant through time, marking peoples and places and ways of being until it came to rest here, in these pages, in these stories that some called crude and others called revelation.\n\nThe chivalry of old times runs through these tales like a dark river beneath the earth. In Otranto it flows strong and deep, carrying with it the ghosts of knights long dead, their honor and their steel both rusted but somehow still sharp. Walpole saw his world, saw the men in it who called themselves noble, and found them wanting. He looked back to times when honor meant something more than words spoken in parliamentary halls, when blood spilled meant something sacred.\n\nAnd there was Frederic, written onto the page like a man carved from older stone. A prince who had known suffering, who had walked with death in foreign lands where infidels waited with sharp steel and sharper faith. The writers made him more than man, made him legend, excess piled upon excess until he stood like a mountain of chivalric virtue, terrible in his perfection.",
            "They call it supply chain management and it moves like a river through the world. From raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it flowing through the hands of men who may never meet nor know each others names. Keith Oliver gave it that name in 1982 though the thing itself existed long before any man thought to name it. He wrote of planning and control and efficiency but these were just words for an older thing. A thing as old as trade itself.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Each one a world unto itself, each one bearing the weight of commerce like ancient columns in some forgotten temple to trade.\n\nProduction stands first among them. Without it there is nothing. It begins with knowing what men want, though want itself is a strange and shifting thing. The market tells us, if we know how to listen. Like reading entrails or watching the flight of birds, men in offices parse numbers and charts seeking auguries of desire. Once known, these desires become orders. Orders become plans. Plans become schedules. Schedules become reality in factories chosen for their capacity to birth these wants into the world.\n\nI saw this once at Walmart and again at Target. Every movement prescribed, every action written down in books thick as bibles. How to wear the uniform. How to unload the trucks. The whole dance choreographed down to the smallest step, because chaos costs money and time is the only thing you can't buy more of.\n\nThen comes supply, the choices of what to make and what to buy. What to keep close and what to send away. Managers sit in rooms and decide which parts of the work belong to them and which belong to others. They call it outsourcing but really its just a way of making things move faster, like water finding the quickest path downhill. They call this velocity and chase it like men once chased gold, always seeking the perfect balance of quality and cost.",
            "They came in the Victorian age these books and they were filled with things of the aristocracy and details heaped upon details until the words themselves groaned under their own weight. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark tales both of them carrying mystery like a shroud and bearing strangeness in their hearts that set them apart from their kin. This strangeness it gave life to their characters and showed the blackness in their souls and the reasons for what they done.\n\nHe walked in dreams Oliver did between Sikes and Crackit who quarreled like wolves over meat and their voices came to him through the darkness of his mind. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field and lights danced before him while unseen hands bore him away through the chaos. Through it all the pain stayed with him constant as hunger constant as death.\n\nThese dreams they came in both books like dark prophets bearing truth. In Oliver's tale they showed what lay inside him like a man gutted and laid bare showing all the hurt and knowing that filled him. When they shot him and he lived it again in chapter 28 he was powerless as a leaf in the wind. The dream showed how the control had gone out of him like blood from a wound. He could not even see who carried him away and the pain that first shocked him now just stayed with him quiet and terrible like a companion. You could see how the boy was broke down by then like Fagin wanted. Beat down so far he wouldnt even try to save his own life when the time came. The day it went and night came on and the silence stretched out forever while the hours ran like water through his fingers.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces looking up from dogeared books and crumpled papers. Their struggles were many but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy. Adrian they called him. Third or fourth grade, memory fails. The letters on the page before him might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in ancient stone. Some sounds he knew true as sunrise, others escaped him like smoke in the wind. His English flowed pure as mountain water but his people came from south of the border, that much was certain.\n\nWe labored together in that fluorescent-lit room until the day his mother appeared. The other children had gone off somewhere, just a few stragglers remained when she walked in wearing worry like a shawl. No English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish that I barely grasped with my meager learning. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer stroke: The boy could read well enough, just not in the tongue of his adopted land. Whether this knowledge served him after, I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but to speak of the wall that stands between languages in our schools, particularly here in California where the border breathes like a living thing. Sometimes the barrier hides in plain sight. Even a child who speaks English pure as spring water might stumble reading it, like a man trying to cross a river on stones he cannot see. We all know this truth, but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough: teach him the strange shapes that make up English words. But for those who barely grasp our tongue, the answer splinters like light through crystal. No single solution will suffice. Two-language teaching, immersion, private instruction, special English classes - each alone stands weak as a sapling in strong wind. But together they might grow into something that holds.\n\nThe two-language way shows promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking children but for all. Studies tell us these children outpace their peers like wolves outrun sheep. Some fear this wastes what we have, but they're wrong as wrong can be. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all flourish like desert flowers after rain. We don't need every teacher speaking two tongues - that's a fool's errand. But we can find helpers, guides who know both worlds, to bridge the gap between what is and what could be.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A vastness beyond knowing. Some find it in wooden pews and stained glass, others in ancient texts or deep within the hollows of their own hearts. Many take up the faiths of their fathers like old coats passed down, worn thin at the edges but familiar. Others cast off such inheritance entirely, prophets of their own small worlds where nothing exists beyond the reach of their understanding. We wander these paths like blind men feeling their way through darkness, seeking some light to lead us from shadow into day.\n\nHe said cardinal and nothing more. We set on the porch watching the rain beat against tin while smoke rose from our cigarettes like small ghosts in the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain met in the growing dark. The clothes hung from him now like empty flags, his hair thin as winter wheat. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such truth. I moved closer and we watched the June rain fall in the twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nDecember took him five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him bought time but not peace, extending his suffering like some cruel mathematical equation. I questioned what sort of god would author such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers. If there was something out there listening it had turned from me long ago like a friend grown weary of my voice.\n\nI could not watch the ending. Would not. The memory of his life meant more than witnessing its departure. I knew him better than the others, better than those who shared his blood, and knew he would not want his child to stand witness while death took its due. For three days I lay curled in darkness waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline County like a man possessed by the soil itself, this Taylor, his mind ever fixed on the republic and what it might become. The earth spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in both worlds, the dust of legislation settling on his farmer's boots like so much chaff. His devotion to the land colored everything he touched, everything he thought, everything he feared might come to pass.\n\nThe republic stood naked before him, stripped of old world traditions that might have bound it like corpse wrappings. Here was virgin territory not just in soil but in governance and Taylor knew it. He saw how rights given by God or nature or whatever dark force ruled the universe were bound together like a hangman's knot, to fail together or hold fast as one. The government, he reasoned, must never touch these things.\n\nIn those days men spoke of natural states and Taylor knew what that meant. The strong would devour the weak and the clever would feast on both, same as it ever was. But civilization demanded better. Taylor held to his beliefs about good and evil like a man clutching a Bible in a thunderstorm, knowing that any government made by men must carry both seeds within it. Good principles protect what's yours, he said, they make the earth yield its bounty, they keep the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drives all men but only becomes evil when it feeds upon others like a carrion crow.\n\nThe Constitution was his lodestone though he wanted it read pure and clean as spring water. No federal leviathan growing fat on taxes and power, nothing beyond what was writ plain on paper. But words alone were dangerous things, he knew, without the ghost of intention haunting their margins. For Taylor the Declaration was the true testament, the document that spoke of sovereign states standing apart yet together, like stalks of wheat in a field that bend together in the wind but keep their separate roots.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was what he did. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding away at nothing, processing the scene before him without attachment or judgment or understanding. Thoughts came and went like dust devils in the desert, there and gone again before they could take hold.\n\nYears back he'd bought him a book about drawing from the right side of the brain on account of some artist he knew told him to. Since he was no more than a boy he'd wanted to draw and this book laid it all out plain as day from what a pencil was to how the mind saw shapes in the world. It talked about framing things. How you could take the world and cut it down to size with invisible borders. How a kitchen full of things could become just a bowl of fruit floating in space if you knew how to look at it right.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt frame nothing. The sight before him was too vast and terrible in its simple awfulness. Like them painters who went through their phases. Picasso with his blues and Monet with his gardens. If this was art then it was art of the basest kind. A masterwork in brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and his arm moved like it belonged to someone else. The water moved in its ancient circles, clear as crystal and just as cold. Little pieces broke away and vanished into that cold void but the main mass stayed put like some creature born to that porcelain bowl. He flushed again harder this time, desperate-like, but that brown testament to human waste just sat there mocking his efforts.\n\nHe stood there in his uniform, green tie cinched tight at his throat like a noose, holding that mop like it was some kind of talisman against what lay before him. Just another bathroom cleaner at the Rite Aid facing down what some nameless patron had left behind. After a spell he reached for the paper, wrapped his hand in it like them old mummies in Egypt till he couldn't see skin no more. Then slow and careful-like he reached down into them cold waters like reaching into the mouth of hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night moves past like a dark river and carries their souls with it. The government men with their papers and statistics know why but knowing dont stop the dying. They say the brain aint ready. Say its too new and soft for such things as steel horses and velocity. Experience too is missing like some vital organ cut away leaving only an empty space where wisdom should dwell.\n\nThese young ones they drive together. Pack animals sharing metal coffins. The California men who study such things showed in their numbers how death follows youth like a dark companion. State men made laws. Papers that say when they can drive and who they can carry but laws are just words on paper and death pays no mind to such things.\n\nSome say eighteen years aint enough. Zuckerman the head doctor says they seek the thrill like moths to flame caring nothing for the burning. Says we ought to wait till that fire dies down some. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there'll be more. Children of the boom times coming up behind ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nThe answer lies plain as bones in the desert. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let the schools teach them still but keep them from the metal beasts that roam the highways. Let them learn slow and careful like. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows the way of things. Make it the same in all places cause death dont care what state youre in when it comes calling.\n\nThis aint new thinking. Aint nothing that hasnt been thought before by men who've seen too many young ones wrapped in sheets by the roadside. But knowing and doing aint the same thing and we keep on like we always have watching them die in the dark.",
            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder but names dont matter much in the grand scheme of things. The brain takes what it hears and makes nothing of it. Like a broken radio receiver catching fragments of signals from somewhere far off and distant. The sufferers can hear alright. Their ears work just fine. But somewhere in the dark corridors of their mind the meaning gets lost. Gets twisted. Like smoke in the wind.\n\nIt wasnt always known by that name. Back in the old days round about 1950 they called it auditory imperception. Some Italian doctors, Bocca and his people, they started testing children who couldn't make sense of the sounds around them. Then Kimura came along with his theories about how the brain takes in sound from both sides. They had themselves a conference in 77. Started really looking into it.\n\nThe way it manifests is like a shadow across the mind. Some cant tell where a sound comes from, like they're lost in a dark room with voices all around. Others cant tell one sound from another or make sense of patterns in speech. Sarcasm flies right past them like a bullet in the night. Words get jumbled up, meanings lost. Its like their minds are trying to catch raindrops in a sieve.\n\nTo find it in a person they got to do tests. Audiologists and speech doctors watching how people listen, how they respond. Like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it leaves behind. They aint found no single way to catch it sure. No one knows where it comes from neither. They put people through their paces with words and numbers coming at them from all sides at once. Sometimes they stick machines in ears to measure the way the brain dances to sound. But still it remains elusive. Like trying to catch the wind in your hands.",
            "They'd asked me what I aimed to do with my life and I told them plain. Said I meant to work with the children. The broken ones. The ones whose own blood had turned against them like vipers in the dark. Told them I'd walk into the Division of Family Services and take up that mantle. Not for glory. Not for coin. But because there are things in this world that need doing and someone needs doing them.\n\nThe values I carried weren't learned from no book. Service. Respect. The knowing of right from wrong that burns in a man's chest like hot coals. These weren't just words to me. They were like old bones buried deep in the earth. Fundamental. Ancient.\n\nI remember the summer of '09, fresh from Piedmont College with psychology papers in hand, not knowing which way to point my feet. That's when I saw him. Just a boy. Sixteen summers old, sitting scared on my friend's couch like some wounded animal. His folks had done things. Bad things. Things that make God turn his face away.\n\nI drove out to that house the next day after he called the law. Told the police what I knew, showed them my credentials like they meant something. They asked me to talk to the parents, said their hands were tied by the law. Those parents, they spoke in circles and shadows, calling their boy manipulative, trying to make simple what wasn't simple at all. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nAnd justice. Lord, the justice. We talk about individuals like we honor them, but we're all trying to sand down our edges to fit in some box society built. I never did cotton to that. Walked my own path through school, wore what pleased me, colored my hair like wildfire, stuck metal through my flesh because it was mine to do with. Stood up with the GSBA folks, fought the old hatred wherever it showed its face. Because that's what justice is. Not some word in a book, but a thing you do with your hands and your heart and your voice.\n\nSome folks say we're all just dust in the wind. Maybe so. But while we're here, we got work to do. Hard work. And I aim to do it.",
            "Sleep comes like a thief in the night for some and not at all for others. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like a dark specter, casting its shadow across both the biological and sociocultural realms of human suffering. They say it runs in the blood, passed down through generations like an old curse, while others claim it's born of the world we've built around us - the concrete canyons and electric lights that mock the natural order.\n\nThere are those who would categorize sleep's absence, sort it into neat little boxes with names like Dyssomnia and Parasomnia, as if giving the darkness a name might tame it. Primary disorders they call some, while others trail behind other afflictions of the mind like faithful dogs. The sleepless ones pace their nights away, while across town the oversleepers drift through days like ghosts, neither fully here nor gone. Then there are the sleepwalkers and the night screamers, their minds caught in some terrible dance between waking and sleeping.\n\nDeep in the laboratories they keep their mice, watching them sleep and wake, studying the tiny sparks in their brains that decide between consciousness and oblivion. They found something called orexin in the hypothalamus, a messenger that speaks in the language of wake and sleep. The GABAB receptors stand guard like sentinels, and when they're triggered the sleep comes washing over like a dark tide. But if something's wrong with these sentinels, if they're broken or missing, then sleep becomes as elusive as smoke in the wind. They tested this with their chemicals and their mice, watching as the creatures surrendered to artificial sleep, and wrote down their findings in neat columns and graphs as if they'd captured some fundamental truth about the nature of consciousness itself.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The eastern halls where they put me that first year stood at the far reaches of civilization, past which only the great concrete monuments to sport and spectacle rose against the grey Pennsylvania sky. From Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of twenty-five minutes or more, longer still when the weather turned, as it often did in that place they called State College though it was neither state nor college but something else entirely.\n\nAn old graduate told me once how it used to be, the eastern dormitories separated from everything by vast tracts of nothing. Empty land that stretched like some forsaken prairie. Now steel and concrete rise where emptiness once dwelt. The Creamery. The infirmary. Apartment blocks that crowd the horizon like tombstones in some vast necropolis. The campus spreads like a living thing, consuming distance, making movement harder with each passing season. But there is salvation in the bicycle. Simple machine of chains and wheels, useless without riders, worthless without paths to ride.\n\nMy friend spoke to me of bicycles. He had forgotten them for years but remembered now like a man remembering his own hands. Bikes are great, he said, though fashion had turned against them for a time. They endured. A bowl of morning grain and the strength in your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. The mathematics of survival are simple. I live far now, as far as those eastern halls where once I dwelt, but the bicycle saves me. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bicycle devours that distance in five minutes or less if you're willing to push hard enough. Pollock Road cuts straight and true but it's treacherous, full of dangers seen and unseen, wheeled or walking.\n\nSome speak of walking like it's salvation but I cannot spare the time. Without the bicycle there is only walking and walking takes what cannot be given. Forty minutes lost each day to Thomas building alone. Two hours and more each week vanished like smoke. Add the other wanderings, the appointments, the necessities. Time becomes a currency you cannot spend.",
            "He watched as the world burned itself into submission through screens and steel and the false promises of men who wore suits like armor. Huxley had seen it coming. Had written of it in that book of his. Brave New World. A world where the individual was nothing and the mass of humanity everything and all of it controlled by strings pulled by hands unseen.\n\nThe people there lived like cattle. Bred for purpose. Each one conditioned from birth to seek pleasure like addicts seek their next fix. Above them the World Controller moved like some dark god. Puppet master of flesh and bone. Through the lens of Marx you could see the truth of it. The way the classes moved against each other like tectonic plates. Grinding. Crushing. Words like homogeny and reification scattered through the pages like broken glass.\n\nThe false consciousness lay heavy on them all. Like a blanket of fog that wouldn't lift. The common folk kept ignorant of their own chains. Delta. Gamma. Names for sheep who didn't know they were sheep. Their minds filled with hypnopædic whispers telling them to consume. To spend. To want. The Controller watching it all from his tower of ivory and steel.\n\nNo love existed in that world. No depth to any soul. Characters moved through the pages like ghosts. Hollow. Empty. The men spoke of women like they were meat. Pneumatic, they called them. The women no better. All of them rutting like animals without shame. Each class content in their ignorance. Happy slaves to a system that fed them lies with mechanical precision. Consume, it told them. Obey. Stay in line. And they did. God help them they did.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam, where men argued in circles about peace and violence like dogs chasing their own tails. The question hangs heavier now in the air than it did then, like smoke that won't clear. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted their tune from hatred to something like reverence, as if fear had transformed into a strange kind of worship. No one could have known then that a man named Obama, carrying the weight of Muslim blood in his veins, would stand for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's story burns in my mind like a fever dream. The words they write of him stand against the truth like a house built on sand. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise, tells of tribes brought to heel under his sword, of conversions born not of choice but of steel and fire. Yet in these pages they paint him meek as a lamb, a misunderstood soul whom men sought like water in the desert.\n\nThere's something wrong in how they mirror the Christ's works. They tell of mutton and milk multiplied for forty men, as if copying from an older book, stealing glory from an older truth. It's a thievery of miracles, taking the bread of Christ's life and claiming it as their own. The writers craft their tales careful-like, building a false prophet from borrowed stones.\n\nThe stories come down through whispers, through men telling tales of other men telling tales, like smoke signals rising up through generations. Each telling makes the truth more distant, more suspect. They mean these chains of witnesses to strengthen their case but they only weaken it, like a rope frayed by too many hands.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've fashioned this gentle prophet from the clay of lies. History tells us different - speaks of blood and conquest where they speak of peace. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the maze of these carefully crafted stories.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside quick as a snake sheds its skin in the thinking that came after. Like tracks in the desert sand that fade with each passing wind we see the way of it moving further and further from where it began. The world now bears witness to something stirring in men's minds, a new way of seeing that cannot be unseen. There are those who cling to the old ways like a drowning man to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade like dying embers in the night.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing deep as roots in ancient ground. A hunger will rise in them to strip away the false words laid upon the truth like paint on stone, seeking what he who died upon the cross truly meant. Time will pass like water through fingers but what comes will come sure as darkness follows day. The great wheel will turn backward, grinding away the layers of man's invention like rust from old iron until naught remains but what the carpenter's son brought forth from God before others spoke their piece.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the new world and the old, drawing souls in its wake like flotsam in a river, the church will stand. But as the hands of time spin widdershins the many voices that now cry out in His name will fade to one. Where now stand walls between believers they will crumble like adobe in the rain, leaving only the bare earth where once stood monuments to difference.\n\nThe world has seen such turnings before. Rome that once fed Christians to lions knelt before the cross. This land that once bound men in chains now sees them rise to power. So too will come this great undoing in matters of faith, this stripping away of all that was built upon His words until only truth remains. They will learn to read His words like one reads the sky for coming storms, seeking meaning beneath the surface of things.\n\nIn the before time there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which all else flowed. One God, one truth handed down from heaven, and the ancient words writ in blood and fire. When Rome's legions marched into Jerusalem they found a people already split like a lightning-struck tree - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew only toil and prayer.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and unvarnished like a blade left to rust in the rain. Deep in their cores men harbor greed and selfishness that cant be washed clean. They look only to their own betterment and care nothing for those beneath them scrabbling in the dirt. You see it clear as bone in the factory owners and their kind, those who lord over the great mechanical beasts of industry.\n\nThese men, they build their empires on flesh and bone and blood. Their factories rise like iron mountains against the sky, and Sinclair writes of them saying how \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries death in it. The owners know this truth but care nothing for it. They watch their chimneys vomit black poison into God's air and let their sewage run thick with animal waste and worse things, things that have no name.\n\nThe workers are no more than cattle to them. Less than cattle maybe. \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair says, \"there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Men work until their hands bleed and their backs break and then they're cast aside like spent shells. No warning. No mercy. The law dont protect them and never did.\n\nThey lived in Packingtown like prisoners in hell, breathing poison and drinking death. No help would come. The unions that sprouted up were carrion birds feeding on desperate men. These people, these workers, they were slaves in all but name. Sinclair saw it true when he wrote how they were \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" That was the truth of it. Raw and cruel as winter.",
            "In the dark chambers of Poe's mind there lived a poem called Dream-land and he called it among his better works though who can say what constitutes better in the realms of madness and despair. Within its verses he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place, and Mabbott who came after traced it back to Virgil like a man tracking wounded prey across timeworn earth. Virgil knew it as some far northern isle beyond Britain where Greek minds dared not venture, but there was another source closer to Poe's time, for he had developed a powerful hunger for German writers and their words lay heavy in his thoughts.\n\nThe connection runs deep as blood. Karl J. Arndt wrote of it in his testament to literary kinship, speaking of how Poe's words echoed Goethe's like twin bells in a forgotten tower. Goethe himself stood as a titan among men, creator of Faust, that dark drama born in two parts like some bifurcated beast, first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death came calling for its author.\n\nHidden in Faust's second coming was \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and her gift of a goblet to her king. The king, mad with grief and drink, watched his world darken until he too sought death's embrace, casting the goblet into black waters before closing his eyes forever. Here lay the shadow of Poe's own demons, his drinking and his losses mirrored in this German king's despair.\n\nThey were companion pieces though separated by language and ocean, these tales of Thulé. In Dream-land Poe painted landscapes of darkness where ghosts of dead friends wandered like lost cattle on a moonless plain, a world drained of color and hope. It was as if he had walked into Goethe's grief-stricken realm and found it suited him, found it matched the darkness in his own soul.\n\nGoethe's words would have reached Poe through various channels, not least through Tennyson whom Poe regarded with reverence approaching worship. The German's influence spread like wildfire through the literary world of that time, and Poe, ever the watchful crow, would have seen and known and understood.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than that, in the dark recesses of a man's soul where duty and indifference wage their ancient war. In California where the sun beats merciless upon concrete and steel they wrote these words into books of law, these words about punitive damages and what makes a man culpable for the suffering of others.\n\nThe woman Palmer had walked the aisles of D&D Markets that October evening like any other soul seeking sustenance in the fluorescent temple of commerce. The applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the floor like some visceral warning ignored. Wayne had seen it first, told Martin who sat in his office eating his dinner like a king in his castle. Fifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came too with the same words of warning. Martin dismissed them both with the casual cruelty of a man who had forgotten what it meant to care for the safety of others.\n\nThe clock marked half past five when Palmer's feet went out from under her and she lay broken on the cold tile floor, her back twisted by gravity and neglect. Before her there had been others, five souls who had fallen in that same year, their accidents recorded in ledgers that spoke of liability and loss.\n\nThe question before the judge was one of malice, that dark flower that blooms in the heart of men. The law speaks of oppression and fraud but what transpired in that store was something older. Martin had known of the danger, had been told twice of the threat that lay waiting. He had known of the five who fell before, yet he chose to sit and eat while danger lurked in his domain. The law calls this conscious disregard, this willful turning away from the probability of harm.\n\nIn the end the judge would have to weigh these things: the repeated warnings ignored, the history of falls that came before, the casual dismissal of duty that spoke of something deeper than mere negligence. The law provides for punishment when malice can be shown, when a man knows the consequences of his inaction and chooses still to let others suffer. And in this case the evidence lay clear as blood on sand.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a starved thing. It came upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a dark passenger riding the hollow spaces between heartbeats. Three years gone and still it lingered. Not a thing but a someone, she reckoned, though no boy had stirred that deep well within. They came and went like autumn leaves, their awkward advances scattered by winds they could not name. She pondered this strangeness in the dark hours, this emptiness that defied the natural order of young girls. Years of thinking brought nothing but shadows of answers, yet still she carried on, the question burning like a coal in her chest.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world. They lived without the thunder of argument save for when their daughter's wild spirit pulled against the reins of their quiet ways. She was their opposite star, burning bright and wild where they glowed steady, yet carrying their kindness like an inheritance.\n\nBut this day the peace broke. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed, she heard her mother's cry cut the air like a blade. Kitchen-ways, where the sound died quick as it was born. She ran, heart hammering against her ribs. Mama lay twisted on the tile, pain writing itself across her face in cursive lines. Words came broken and scattered between breaths. Hospital, she said. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering the strength learned in other seasons. She lifted her mother like a child might lift a wounded bird, gentle despite the urgency burning in her blood.\n\nThe hospital air carried its own scripture of antiseptic and suffering, though she paid it no mind. Her world had narrowed to the weight in her arms, the need to find help. She called out and white-clad figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother into the fluorescent depths of those sterile halls. Left alone, she sat with worry gnawing at her bones.\n\nAll this because of a vase too high, a stepping stool too treacherous. The highest cabinet had won its silent war with gravity, and her mother had paid the price.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, promised less death from the heart's betrayals and the brain's dark hemorrhages. They called it aMed, this scoring of sustenance, marking the consumption of what grows from earth and tree, the fish that swim in waters both warm and cold, the pressing of olives for their oil. They shunned the flesh of beasts and the white fat that runs like tallow.\n\nThe knowledge wasn't new. Others before had tracked the dying, counted the fallen to the old ways versus the new. They found fewer corpses among those who ate as their ancestors did along those ancient shores. The fat ones, given choice between this old way and the modern lean, shed their burden better when they followed the path of olive and grape.\n\nThey watched the nurses, seventy-four thousand and more, women who tended the sick and dying across eleven states of this American empire. For twenty years they watched them, marking their eating six times over, through papers filled with boxes and numbers, validating their truth through hospital records and death certificates. They tracked the heart's failings and the brain's betrayals, confirmed in sterile rooms or on cold metal tables. Some they called probable, these casualties of modern life, when papers couldn't be found but the death was certain all the same.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills, the monthly blood of women and the medicines they took when it ceased, the running and walking and moving through time. They built models of numbers, trying to separate truth from coincidence, adjusting for the chaos of human existence.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke clear as bones. Twenty years of watching showed two thousand heart failures, seventeen hundred strokes, a thousand dead from hearts and brains combined. Those who followed the old ways, who scored highest in their adherence to olive and fish and grain, they died less. The numbers said it plain - their risk was less by nearly a third compared to those who ate the modern way.\n\nThe truth was there in the counting of the dead.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood alone at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, the black letters stark against the pale surface. Burma they called it now though some remembered Myanmar, that place of green jungle and red earth where men in uniform had taken what wasnt theirs to take. They had come in the night in 1962 with their rifles and their papers and their proclamations and when morning came the old way was gone.\n\nThe monks came first. Orange robed and barefoot they walked the streets in their thousands, silent in their protest like burning autumn leaves caught in a windless day. Saffron Revolution, the papers called it. As if revolution could be named like a child or a beloved pet. The people watched and then they too came forth but the men in uniform had waited long enough. They came with their guns and their boots and their ancient rage. They broke down monastery doors and dragged the monks into the street. Foreign men with cameras disappeared into cells never to return. One day they shot a Japanese man named Kenji Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. The official count said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different tales. Several thousand, he said. Several thousand souls.\n\nThis was an old story told new. Since men first gathered in tribes there were those who would rule by fear and blood. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who called themselves gods. Even now in America men in suits spoke to other men in suits about power and control and the divine right of presidents.\n\nThe stories piled up like cordwood. Tiananmen Square where students fell by hundreds or thousands depending on who told the tale. Rwanda where Hutu killed Tutsi until the streets ran red. Hitler and his Third Reich building death into an industry. The world turned and turned and nothing changed except the names of the dead.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington lived in the long years of his craft and in how he shaped the men who played for him like a sculptor shapes clay. His fingers on ivory keys whispered soft and low through the pieces we speak of here but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant and waiting. He built frameworks of sound like a carpenter builds the bones of a house, letting the soloists wander through the rooms he created, their instruments crying out in the night like lost souls seeking redemption. The framework held them but did not bind them and in this way the music lived and breathed like something wild yet contained.\n\nHe knew each man's sound like a father knows his son's voice. Knew how the brass would weep and how the reeds would sing and how they would all come together in the dark of the night when the music called them home. In this knowing he wrote pieces that would echo through time like footsteps in an empty hall.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of holy scripture, telling how he made the human voice into something that was both more and less than human. The piece moves slow like molasses in winter, twelve bars stretching out across six choruses like six days of creation. First comes the voice and reeds speaking to each other like lovers in the dark, then the trumpet crying out muted and blue as midnight. The clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The band rises up like a congregation in prayer, brass and reed calling back and forth across the divide. In the fifth chorus everything comes together like judgment day, reeds calling high and brass answering with thunder. Then back to the beginning, voice and reed once more, but now the voice growls like something caught between heaven and hell.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered recorded when the calendar turned again, Miley's trumpet speaks in tongues while Baby Cox's voice answers in sounds that might have been words in some forgotten language. It Don't Mean a Thing brings Nanton's trombone moaning low and sweet like a lost soul finally finding its way home. All of it bearing Ellington's mark like cattle branded on the range, each piece carrying his signature written in notes instead of ink.",
            "The shells speak their own truth and man has long sought to understand their language. They spiral in the darkness of time like ancient scrolls waiting to be read. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we had not yet begun to dream in numbers when looking at living things and his words echo still through the halls of science like a ghost that won't rest.\n\nThe mathematics of life and death reside in these calcium tombs we call shells. They wind their way through space like cosmic dancers following rules we barely comprehend. We took the genus Prunum, those small white prophets of the sea, and laid them bare under the X-ray's merciless eye. The machine called CerioShell consumed our numbers and spat forth possibilities - shapes that could be, shapes that never were, shapes that might yet come to pass in the slow grinding of evolution's wheel.\n\nThe shell is nothing more than a tomb that grows. It spirals through time and space like a creature possessed, marking its passage in degrees, each revolution a testament to its existence. These turns we call whorls, spinning around an axis invisible as God. The columella stands as a pillar of calcium, bearing witness to the creature's passage through time. Each whorl speaks to its neighbor across a line we name suture, though it sutures nothing. The final whorl carries the living flesh within its curved walls, while above it the spire reaches toward heaven like a cathedral's tower.\n\nThey can be viewed from all angles - apex to base, face-on or turned away - but their truth remains encrypted in calcium and time. To count their whorls is to count their days, marking each quarter turn like the phases of some molluscan moon. The aperture traces its path through space like a soul leaving its mark on the world, each moment captured in coordinates of flesh and shell.\n\nThese are the mathematics of life itself, numbers that dance on the edge of comprehension. By understanding their dance we might glimpse the face of evolution itself, though it turns away from our gaze like a shy child. The shells wait, patient as stone, for us to learn their language.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay quiet in their graves these past ten years, their numbers unchanging like ancient stones in a barren field. The nation moved forward in some ways, yes, bringing water where there was none and cleaning filth where it festered, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same, their blood seeping into earth that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey had their midwives now, seven out of ten births blessed with hands that knew something of bringing life into the world. But these women, these traditional healers with their ancient knowledge, they stood helpless when the real darkness came, when the blood flowed like river water and death stalked the birthing rooms. The numbers told a story but it was a story written in half-truths and shadows.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies from their mothers' wombs when they must, clean knives and sterile rooms, but in the villages they did not. Could not. The difference between urban and rural was the difference between life and death, seven percent versus two, numbers that meant everything and nothing at all. And the poor, they suffered worst of all, as they always had and always would, twenty-seven percent less likely to see a doctor's face or feel a healer's touch.\n\nThe question that remained was as old as suffering itself: how to stop the dying. Some said to build programs, targeted and precise like a rifleman's bullet. These programs would show results quick and clean, numbers to please the men who counted such things. But there was a darkness in this path too. When money flowed to one place it dried up in another, like a river changing course, leaving death in its wake. And the paperwork, endless as desert sand, forms upon forms upon forms, a tower of babel built of bureaucracy while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like some dark vine stretching across a century of human experience, its tendrils reaching into places where no classification could follow. Within its twisted branches lay the subspecies, bastard children of rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning their own mutant offspring until the vine became a forest unto itself.\n\nAmong these dark woods stood Heavy Metal like some ancient and terrible god, its presence felt these forty years past. It spoke in tongues of rage and despair and sometimes in whispers of things men ought not speak of. The people who found this god began to shape it, to carve from its flesh new idols, each more terrible than the last, until the very meaning of the thing became lost in its own shadow.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured like a broken mirror, each shard reflecting something different yet the same. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, to the movement itself, for it was never just music but something older, something that lived in the blood.\n\nMetal was born in darkness and nursed on violence. More, always more. More thunder in the bass, more screaming in the night, more blood on the altar. The players were priests of their craft, their fingers dancing across strings like witch doctors working ancient magicks. In those days the drugs came like a flood, mid-seventies, turning men's minds to vapor and their music to something from beyond the veil. They made records that spoke in tongues, hiding behind chemical ghosts and electrical storms. The darkness they brought forth was new and terrible and true, not like the sugared lies that filled the airwaves. They reached back through time to the Romantic dead and pulled forth something primal, something that had always waited there in man's heart.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their warped canvases there was another who walked alone. Henri Rousseau. He crafted dreams both sleeping and waking and laid them bare on canvas like prophets of old inscribing visions on stone. The Dream he called it, this thing of 1910, this testimony to wonder and terror both. In it a woman lies pale and naked on a velvet couch while dark jungle things watch her from the shadows with eyes like burning coals. The painting spoke to more than just the scene it showed. It spoke to Rousseau's own hunger, his desperate wanting. Recognition. Acceptance. The validation of men who dealt in paint and canvas like priests dealing in salvation.\n\nHe was born in Laval in the year 1844 when the world was younger and simpler and his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived as the middle folk lived. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls like some ancient ferryman of souls, though they called him douanier, a title that wasnt his to claim. His first wife Clémence died and before her eight babies that never drew breath proper and in the end there was only Julia left to him. Grief sat heavy on him like a crown of thorns and he turned to painting like a drunk turns to whiskey, seeking something to fill the void that death had carved in him.\n\nHe painted in the time of giants. While Matisse and his kind sought to break the old ways like mirrors in which they saw reflections they could not abide, Rousseau wanted only to join their ranks. To be counted among them. He who had no learning and no credentials save what the years had given him. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared convention like it was a poison in his veins while Rousseau chased it like a man dying of thirst chases a mirage in the desert. The truth of it was written in every brushstroke, every color laid down by hands that had come too late to art but would not be denied their chance to speak.",
            "The old ones spoke of truth and beauty like twins born of the same darkness, bound in blood and breath. Keats knew it. Wrote it on paper that yellowed and crumbled but the words stayed true as bone. Beauty is truth, truth beauty. Nothing more to know in this world or the next.\n\nWe learn what we learn. Through books and through pain and through the long dark nights of experience. But the knowing of right and wrong, of what shimmers with grace and what falls dead and cold - that comes from somewhere deeper. Some cavern in the soul that no light ever touched. We try to speak of it, to capture it in words like butterflies in a killing jar, but it escapes. Always it escapes.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa. Men speak of shadow and light, of technique and history, but these words are just wind. They dont touch the heart of it. Ask a man why he loves a painting or a story and watch him struggle like a wounded animal. Theres just something about it, he'll say, and in those words lies more truth than in all the critics' tomes.\n\nO'Connor knew. You tell a story because nothing else will do. Because some truths cant be spoken plain. They need the cover of fiction like a man needs shelter in a storm. The same with right and wrong. Wittgenstein saw it too. Ethics cant be caught in the net of language. It lives in that space between words where meaning drowns.\n\nThe connection runs deep as marrow. Art and morality touch us in places we cant name, like ghosts passing through walls. Literature carries this burden heaviest of all. McKean said it true - you cant separate the story from the moral any more than you can separate the blood from the vein. Values run through words like rivers through a landscape, carving deeper channels with each passing year. This is why we read. This is why we write. To touch that nameless thing that lives in the spaces between what we can say and what we know to be true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, a thing unified and terrible in its strength, its culture bleeding through the veins of earth from the shadowed peaks of München down to where Kiel meets the cold Baltic waters. This same blood runs west to east, from where Köln squats by the Rhine through the heartland to Dresden's stone shoulders against the Elbe. That such a beast should spring from many heads surprises none who know its past.\n\nGermania. The old ground. The name itself carries wars in its syllables, disputed by men who make their trade in dead words and older bones. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of northern shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, those who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their original name - Germans - stuck like dried blood to history's pages. Caesar, that first namer of things beyond Rome's reach, took the word Germanus from Gaulish tongues and used it to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, though others trace it to the ger, that spear they carried into battle, or to garim, that Irish word for shouting, as if the Germans were nothing but noise and fury given flesh.\n\nTacitus wrote in his ninety-eighth year after their Christ that these people must have sprung from the earth itself, pure and unmixed, for what man would cross seas to reach such a place of wild darkness and bitter skies unless he had been born to it. The land itself rejected strangers.\n\nAnd the Romans, those builders of empires, they came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry and sometimes leaving their dead. The Germanic tribes appeared like wolves at the empire's edges, trading what they took from the land and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions not their own. They were becoming what they would be, though they did not know it then.",
            "The play speaks of masks and shadows, of the way men and women wrap themselves in false skins like snakes shedding what God gave them. And in the end they must cast off these skins or be lost to them forever, their souls drifting like smoke in the dark spaces between what is and what seems to be. But the casting off brings its own darkness. Some will turn away. Some will bare their teeth. Some will forgive and some will not and in the end each must choose between the truth of self and the bonds that tie them to the world of men.\n\nWhen woman becomes man the question comes unbidden like a thief in the night. Why. Why does she turn from what the Lord made her to be. Viola speaks of preservation, of survival in a world gone wrong. The captain who helped her speaks gentle words but the world does not. I'll bring you to a captain in this town where lie my maiden weeds, she says, as if those clothes could shield her from the wolves that walk on two legs.\n\nShe walks as a man among men but the price is isolation, cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. And the deception breeds more deception like maggots in summer meat. Olivia sees in her what she wishes to see. Whither my lord, Cesario husband stay, she cries out, while Orsino speaks words that carry weight like stones: Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n\nThe modern eye might see something else entirely in this masquerade of flesh and bone. Might see how the lies peel back layers of truth like skin from an orange. Olivia and Orsino both carry secrets in their hearts dark as river bottom mud. When Olivia looks upon Cesario does she see man or woman or something that dwells in the spaces between. But Shakespeare cares not for such modern thoughts. His Olivia is a mirror held up to those who judge by flesh alone, who see only what their eyes tell them to see.\n\nAt the last she turns from Cesario to Sebastian as easy as wind changes direction. A sister you are she, she says, and blood ties replace what was never love but only its shadow.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing of nightmares that left the Ovaherero and Nama dead in its wake. But empires aint simple things and this one stretched across worlds unknown, each territory carrying its own weight of history like a stone. In the east they found Africans who could read and write when the British came in 1919, taking what the Germans had built. In Kamerun too the natives had learned their letters and numbers, or so they said in those days.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A place where the wind carried death across the desert and the missionaries did what the government would not. They taught the natives while the state turned its back, saving its coins and care for the white children who sat in proper schools with proper teachers. The missionaries got what scraps fell from the government's table and nothing more. This was how it went and how it would go, marking the land long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies raised up educated men, South West Africa's people remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe old books tell it, most in German, written when the empire still breathed. They wrote of schools and systems, of how things were done in those days. Later came the English writers who picked through the bones of the dead empire, comparing one colony to another like a man comparing cattle at market. Cohen wrote of it too, said the whites who settled there made it what it was, different from the east where fewer Europeans made their homes.\n\nThe land itself was neither kind nor cruel, temperate they called it though the desert stretched endless and bare. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come to stay, more than anywhere else in the German territories. In East Africa there were only five thousand or so. The numbers told their own story, but numbers aint always truth.",
            "They rode forth across that disputed ground, these two nations, like ancient enemies circling one another in the dust and heat of fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three they clashed and bled, the high water mark coming in forty-six when American forces descended like biblical locusts upon Mexican soil, claiming Texas and the Southwest territories in a tide of manifest destiny that knew no bounds.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all nations sharing such scars upon the earth they fought over God and custom and the old ways of their fathers, though perhaps they knew not why. Their hatred was a thing passed down from the English and Spanish crowns, ancient as the stones themselves, deep as the waters that divided their lands.\n\nSeventeen times did these nations clash proper in those years, though countless smaller skirmishes dotted the borderlands like stars in the night sky. Bandits and mercenaries crossed back and forth across that imaginary line drawn in blood, raiders striking at settlements while good men slept. The frontier was a lawless thing then, untamed and wild as the hearts of the men who sought to claim it.\n\nThe old Catholic ways of Mexico stood in stark opposition to the Protestant fervor of the Americans, much as fascism and communism would divide nations in the century to come. But all things must end. As the century waned like a dying fire, Mexico found itself bound to American interests not by conquest but by coin. The hunger for land gave way to the hunger for profit, and the old blood feuds faded like tracks in the desert sand, though the memories remained, etched deep in the bones of both peoples.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I hadn't known such illness existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it from some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd say it like gospel: People gonna stay sick, always need tending to. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the white uniform like a shield against what might come.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years walked on this earth, alone, pockets empty as a church on Monday, body betraying everything I'd built. Still am that way. After fifteen years living off government mercy ain't nothing left to call mine except breath and bone. Each sunrise brings its own war against security, dignity, whatever scraps of pride remain. Nothing certain no more except one truth hard as stone: Wouldn't have survived without blood kin and them few friends stood fast. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No deed to safety exists in this world no matter how careful you lay your plans. Some storms too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThis country needs weaning off the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust each other again than dig our separate holes in the ground waiting for judgment.\n\nThey talk about rugged individuals built this land. Truth is it was built on shared bread and borrowed tools. Them pioneer wagons didn't cross them mountains alone. Was communities moving west together, sharing what they had.\n\nKeep your preparations. Got my own kit - medical supplies, water tablets, window plastic and tape against whatever poison might come floating down. Flashlights and batteries lined up like soldiers. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods stacked in rows. You got land, plant it. Got wood, burn it.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbor's name. Might be the hand that pulls you through.",
            "In the old world there was a prince. Born to wealth and station in a time before Christ walked the earth. He who would become the Buddha. The prince walked away from all he knew and found enlightenment beneath a tree and from his teachings came the thing men would call Buddhism and within it the orthodox strain known as Theravada. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion aint what it was. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year, monks and common folk alike gathered for some ritual the Buddha never spoke of nor ordained. The changes run deep as bone. From the surface down into the marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have worked changes in their doctrine like a smith works iron, bending to forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all.\n\nWords have weight here and must be measured careful. There are forces inside and forces outside. Inside being them that follow the Buddhasasana whether they wear the robe or no. Outside being all others who dont. Some forces come with malice burning in their hearts like coal and seek to tear down what Buddha built. Others pass by like wind neither helping nor harming though their passing may leave marks all the same. These words will echo through what follows like footfalls in an empty hall.\n\nYou got to know what lies at the heart. The three jewels they call the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma itself held in three baskets of ancient text. The Suttas which tell the tales, the Vinaya which sets the rules, and the Abhidhamma which speaks of things beyond the world we know. They talk of Anatta which means the soul aint real, and Dukkha which means life is suffering, and Anicca which means nothing lasts. A man must know these things deep in his gut if he aims to break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and birth that turns and turns without end. When the wheel stops turning then desire and hatred and confusion stop too. The Vinaya tells men how to live. Common folk got five rules: dont kill, dont lie, dont steal, dont rut like animals, dont poison yourself with drink or drugs. Monks got more rules than stars in the sky. But at the center of it all like the hub of some great wheel are the four noble truths. First that life is pain. Second that wanting causes pain. Third that pain can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture ain't no simple thing and it moves through negotiations like blood through veins. You can't hold it or name it proper but it's there all the same, defining itself by absence as much as presence, like the shape of a dead tree against the evening sky. It ain't uniform and it sure ain't singular and them that say all folk of one land act the same way might as well be reading chicken bones for truth.\n\nThey'll tell you Russians is stubborn and Japanese bend like river reeds but that ain't worth the breath used to speak it. What matters is how deep them cultural roots go into the soil of the matter at hand, how they twist and turn beneath the surface where no eye can see. When a man looks upon foreign ways he sees them through the dirty window of his own upbringing, can't help but measure one against the other like comparing knife blades.\n\nUnderstanding foreign minds means walking through their histories like ghost towns, seeing their hates and fears scattered like old bones in the dust. Ain't no point in judging or trying to remake what generations have built. You take it as it stands and work within its walls, especially if you come to the table bearing a weaker hand. And if you find yourself in strange territory, respect for their ways is the only currency worth trading.\n\nBut culture ain't just about borders drawn on maps. Companies got their own tribes and customs, like little kingdoms built of paper and glass. Some demand their warriors stay late into the night while others let them roam free. You see it in their clothes, their words, the way orders flow down like water. Some let their people give freely to charity, others keep tight reins on such things. Even in American companies the differences run deep as mineshafts, varying from city to prairie, from coast to coast.\n\nValues is the bedrock underneath it all, the why of everything that comes after. In some places saving face matters more than gold, and you won't see no man shame his tribe to win a deal. Others value the hard bargain like a religion, won't settle till blood's been drawn. Knowing these things before you sit at the table is like knowing where the rattlers sleep. But smart men know that every soul at that table is more than just their tribe's ways, and therein lies the real truth of negotiation.",
            "The fool speaks of godlessness and the words fall dead upon the earth like leaves in winter. These words first writ in ancient psalms and later taken up by Anselm in his treatise on the divine. Aquinas too would carry this torch through darker times. Both men warriors in their own right fighting battles not with steel but with words sharp as obsidian against the void of disbelief. To speak of their arguments we must accept their God as real and true for to do otherwise would be to build a house upon sand and watch it wash away in the tide of reason.\n\nThe mind turns over their words like stones in a dry riverbed. Neither man wholly right nor wholly wrong in their pursuit of truth. Anselm's path winds inward like a serpent seeking warmth in the chambers of the heart. His argument coils around itself saying that God exists in understanding and therefore must exist in truth for how can the mind conceive that which cannot be. The words themselves twisted and gnarled as ancient trees but the heart of it beats steady: truth lies within the soul itself needing no outside proof. This is what men call faith though the word itself has been worn smooth by too many tongues.\n\nAquinas walked a different road. His path marked by signposts of reason and empirical truth like bone markers in a wasteland. He would build his case on foundations of stone not sand believing God could be proven through pure logic alone requiring no leap of faith across the chasm of doubt. Five arguments he laid out like five fingers of a hand reaching toward heaven: change causation contingency degrees of excellence harmony. Each one a thread in a tapestry of reason showing God's existence as necessary as breath to life. Like a man knowing the shape of a missing piece in a puzzle by the void it leaves behind.\n\nThe two paths wind through different territories but seek the same destination. Neither complete neither wholly satisfying to the soul that hungers for absolute truth in a world where truth shifts like desert sands beneath our feet.",
            "Writers lay their words like traps. Each one a snare set to catch some feeling or truth that prowls the darkness of mens minds. Some catch better than others. Fitzgerald he knew the way of such things when he wrote his tale of Gatsby. He would take words that had no business being together and wed them like strange desert creatures coupling in the night. Or he would take a thing, simple as it was, and make it speak for something else entirely. Colors were his chosen tokens. Gold and green and white and gray and red like old blood dried in the sun. In The Great Gatsby these colors became more than what they were. White and gray and shades of pink became messengers carrying whispers of meaning through the pages.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness, of things worn down by time and circumstance until they were all one thing. White carried itself higher, wore better clothes, spoke with practiced words. Gray was its poor relation, faded and tired and used up. Fitzgerald scattered these like bones in a dead land. Everywhere the white showed itself. Daisy and Jordan forever wrapped in white like ghosts haunting the edges of sight. Nick in his white flannels moving through Gatsby's carnival of excess. Tom buttoned up in white when he went to his woman. Catherine with her skin powdered white as desert salt. Only at Gatsby's gathering did the white give way, there where the walls blazed with colors crude as fresh kill.\n\nThe meaning sank deeper. The writer cast his net of white and gray across all common things. The canyons of New York stood white and dead as bleached bones. The names of Gatsby's people faded to gray marks on paper. Apartment buildings lined up like slices of white bread. Plain folk wore the colors like a uniform. Jordan and Daisy's youth was white as morning frost. The valley of ashes bore its gray cars and gray earth like a curse. Even the child by the tracks and the old man with his dogs wore gray like a second skin.\n\nThen Fitzgerald turned these colors into weapons. When Daisy appears again she comes dressed in white, driving white, becoming not a woman but a thing uniform and empty as blown smoke. A prize Gatsby chased across the years. The gray of her fur collar and the white of her dress before the showdown with Tom marked her final transformation. She had become nothing more than a white shadow, a dream that never was.",
            "The land lies quiet under the California sun, bearing its fruits as it has since before men walked upon it. San Diego County. A place where the soil remembers and gives forth its bounty year after year in the mild weather. Tomatoes and citrus fruits hanging heavy on the vine, leafy things sprouting from dark earth, squash lying pale and swollen in their beds. Broccoli crowns like small green cities. The trees bearing their peaches and lemons, yellow and orange jewels in the morning light. Berries bleeding their colors into careful hands. Honey dripping gold from combs built by bees that know nothing of borders or property lines.\n\nThey come now with their organic certifications and their waiting lists. City folk hungry for clean food and clean conscience. The farmers show them around, pointing out the paths where they can walk and watch the birds wheel overhead. Making their money from both the land and the looking at it. Government men come too with their papers and programs, promising aid for those who'll dance to their tune of preservation.\n\nThe costs weigh heavy though. More hands needed in the fields without the chemicals to kill what would eat the crops. More losses to the beetles and the worms and the weeds that grow persistent as sin. Small farms struggling against the giants with their machines and their economies of scale. But the land remembers what it was before, and some try to help it remember better. They plant cover crops and move their cattle in patterns old as the seasons. They pull the invasive plants that would choke out what belongs.\n\nThe parcel lies near Potrero, pressed against the Cleveland National Forest like a child against its mother. One hundred and sixty acres of chaparral and grassland brought over from the Mediterranean, oak trees that have watched centuries pass beneath their branches. The government men have their lists of creatures they want to save - the kangaroo rat and the yellow-legged frog, butterflies with names like epitaphs, the California gnatcatcher singing its song to empty skies.\n\nBefore the white men came with their cattle and their axes to cut cordwood, the Indians walked these hills. How many generations passed through this land, their footsteps worn into paths now lost? The homesteaders came after, claiming their patent on land that never knew it could be owned. They grazed their cattle and cut their wood and the land endured, as it endures still.",

Within that blood dwells love and pride and jealousy and cruelty like ancient spirits writhing in darkness. Brothers know each other in ways no other souls can know and when they look upon each other they see their own self reflected back like some dark mirror of truth. When the world turns black as pitch and circumstances dire thats when the true nature of brotherhood shows itself whether it be righteous or damned. These revelations carry a terrible cost like some old testament debt that must be paid in full. To understand the emotions that spring from shared blood is to shoulder the burden of their consequences. When brother looks upon brother they see not what others might see but what truly dwells in their hearts black or otherwise.\n\nIn the tale of the crimson bird two brothers walked this path through all its fury and pain. They moved through a world of decaying beauty where cypress knees broke the water like bones of the drowned and spanish moss hung like funeral shrouds. Their journey was doomed from the start like some biblical parable of pride and fallibility. When pride crashed against disappointment only one would walk away breathing while the other would join the earth and roots and water. The story speaks through the elder brother and his view of a world both beautiful and merciless where pride drives men to terrible acts. His feelings for his crippled brother Doodle twisted like kudzu round his heart choking whatever love might grow there.\n\nThe older brother's pride ran deep as an artesian well poisoned at its source. From their first steps together till their last he carried resentment for Doodle like original sin. He'd dreamed of teaching someone to hold breath underwater and climb the twisted vines in Old Woman Swamp and race through the pinelands to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle came into the world marked by god or devil with a heart weak as water.

That smile spoke of something deeper than blood something that even pride couldn't fully poison.",

Time was when men likened it to tablets of wax, then to sheets of ancient papyrus, then to bound volumes, and now in these latter days to machines that compute. But these are only shadows cast upon shadows, and the truth of the mind eludes such simple tellings.\n\nThe world comes at us raw and bleeding. Touch and heat and sound and light, all transformed by flesh into something the brain can read like old signs in the desert. The mind works its algorithms like a butcher works meat, bottom to top and top to bottom again. Take the black box sitting in whiteness. The bottom-working mind sees first the color and the edges where darkness meets light, while the top-working mind already knows what boxes are and makes the seeing faster, though sometimes it lies to itself about whether the box is truly there or if it's just a hole cut in the white.\n\nThere's a sentinel in the mind that sorts what matters from what don't. Like a man standing guard at a door, letting some thoughts pass and turning others away. Your feet might crush a thousand blades of grass but the guard won't let you count them. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room will reach your ears like a bullet finding its mark. The guard works always, sorting and resorting what comes through.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments, some fresh as new-dug graves, others ancient as bone. The mind takes what it sees and hears and marks it like a rancher brands cattle. Words get marked three ways - by their shape like tracks in sand, by their sound like echo in canyon walls, and by their meaning like old stories passed down. Some memories live brief as mayflies, dancing their twenty seconds in electric circles through the brain. Others bed down deep in the protein and sinew, making homes in the flesh itself.\n\nThey say knowledge is stored like a web of iron strings, each thought connected to others by rust-worn cables of meaning. Chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on until the web spreads out like the highways of some mad god's kingdom.

Men who had built empires of paper and promise watched them scatter like autumn leaves in a cold wind. The unemployment came first, then the houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing, their owners gone like ghosts into the gathering dark.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in older times, in the days when Clinton held court in the white house. The man had wanted power like all men want power and he had loosened the bonds that held the money-lenders in check. They came like locusts then, these bankers with their papers and their promises, offering salvation in the form of loans to those who had no means to pay them back. Fannie Mae and her twisted sister Freddie Mac danced to this tune, packaging poison as medicine, selling death as life.\n\nThe mortgages they crafted were strange beasts, chimeras with many heads and poisoned teeth. They called them adjustable-rate, called them securities, called them obligations, but they were snares all the same. The people mortgaged their futures and their children's futures, building houses of cards in a windstorm, never seeing the darkness gathering at the edges of their dreams.\n\nWhen the storm came it came with the fury of an old testament god. The great houses of money fell like dominoes in the night. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold their souls for copper pennies. Lehman Brothers vanished like smoke.

So we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of the whole, like taking the measure of a man by his strongest features.\n\nThe calculations stretched before us like a map of some ancient territory, each figure a landmark in understanding how these ten stocks stood in for the whole of IHF. We normalized their percentages to 100, as if adjusting a compass to true north, and measured their contributions to Beta and Return as if weighing gold on scales.\n\nThe numbers spoke clear as desert stars - the return of the ten exceeded the ETF by 6.11 percent, a difference of 16 percent in total. The Beta ran lower by .12, like tracking softer footprints in the sand. Yet questions remained about whether these differences carried true statistical weight, or were merely phantoms in the financial wilderness.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter itself had reached in and torn the heart from our endeavor. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough. The New England cold come down like judgment, driving the bicycles to their hooks and the walkers to their cars, but that wasnt all of it. Not by half. December brought its own demons - papers to grade and tests to mark and the whole machinery of education grinding toward semester's end. The log books lay forgotten like dead leaves.\n\nThe holiday season stretched out before them all like some dark road with no end in sight. Students scattered like quail to their homes, faculty too, the campus standing empty and dead beneath the winter sky. When they returned in January the cold had settled deep in the bones of the earth and February showed no mercy neither. You could say the project started with fire in its belly but fire needs feeding and we had let it die down to embers. We conjured up what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, like some carnival medicine show come to town, and it worked after a fashion. The numbers rose again but the truth of it was we were fighting more than just the seasons and the academic calendar. We were fighting time itself and time always wins.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. The car is freedom and freedom runs in the blood like whiskey. We tried to tempt them away with prizes. Gift cards for coffee and food, massages, books. But a man or woman behind the wheel of their own automobile is like God himself deciding when and where to go and that's a hard thing to trade for a free lunch. Later we wondered if bigger prizes might have turned the tide. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars with their silent engines and their promise of virtue. If we had played it different, saved the big prizes for when the winter came down and the spirit flagged, maybe the numbers would have told a different story. But maybes are like prayers - sometimes they get answered and sometimes they just drift away on the wind.",
            "I sat there in the dim light watching them old Edison reels spin, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901, all of them trick films they called them. Magic made of light and shadow and lies. The illusions danced across the screen like specters from some forgotten carnival, each one bound by rules old as theatre itself.\n\nThey were prison films in their way, trapped in boxes of their own making. Set-bound and frontal like some ancient proscenium arch in a dead man's playhouse. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, bearing testament to the conjurer's craft through long shots and medium frames, each film a singular moment stretched thin across time's cruel axis.\n\nYet some of them, those that came with the turning of the century, they dared. They broke free of their chains, splitting themselves into multiple shots like some cinematic hydra.\n\nThe stage held them all, these phantoms. Interior sets built like coffins for the living, the camera fixed and staring like death itself. No following of figures here, no chase through depths of field. This was vaudeville's bastard child, born in the womb of magic shows and carnival tents. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, side to side, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900, they shuffled across the frame like condemned men, entering stage right, moving in their horizontal dance of the damned.\n\nThe proscenium arch was their master and their god. Long shots and medium shots were its prophets, but close-ups were heresy, forbidden fruit in this garden of illusions. Like theatre-goers of old, we watched from afar, never permitted to breach that sacred distance between performer and witness.\n\nOne shot, one film. That was the law of their world, binding these spectral performances to mere minutes of life. Stories were sparse things here, stripped down to base trickery - disappearances, transformations, the stuff of street corner magicians and carnival barkers. But even in these simple deceptions lay deeper truths. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, birthed in 1895, hid its secrets in plain sight. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the lie, where Mary's head wasn't Mary's head at all, though to the innocent eye it all flows like water over stone, one continuous stream of terrible truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a paradox of time itself, like bones bleached white in the desert sun yet still holding the marrow of life within. Ian Watt called it what it was, this thing that breathed both old and fresh air, praised and damned in the same breath by those who would judge such things. They spoke of its emptiness while others saw in it something terrible and sublime, like Burke did, though perhaps he knew not what darkness truly dwelt there.\n\nWhen Walpole birthed The Castle of Otranto into this world he did what no man had done before, taking the ancient romances and the modern ones too and binding them together with blood and ink and shadow. He reached back into the theater of old times, into the stone and mortar of medieval walls, into traditions that lay like dead things but weren't dead at all. The word gothic itself had wandered like a vagrant through time, marking peoples and places and ways of being until it came to rest here, in these pages, in these stories that some called crude and others called revelation.\n\nThe chivalry of old times runs through these tales like a dark river beneath the earth. In Otranto it flows strong and deep, carrying with it the ghosts of knights long dead, their honor and their steel both rusted but somehow still sharp. Walpole saw his world, saw the men in it who called themselves noble, and found them wanting. He looked back to times when honor meant something more than words spoken in parliamentary halls, when blood spilled meant something sacred.\n\nAnd there was Frederic, written onto the page like a man carved from older stone. A prince who had known suffering, who had walked with death in foreign lands where infidels waited with sharp steel and sharper faith. The writers made him more than man, made him legend, excess piled upon excess until he stood like a mountain of chivalric virtue, terrible in his perfection.",
            "They call it supply chain management and it moves like a river through the world. From raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it flowing through the hands of men who may never meet nor know each others names. Keith Oliver gave it that name in 1982 though the thing itself existed long before any man thought to name it. He wrote of planning and control and efficiency but these were just words for an older thing. A thing as old as trade itself.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Each one a world unto itself, each one bearing the weight of commerce like ancient columns in some forgotten temple to trade.\n\nProduction stands first among them. Without it there is nothing. It begins with knowing what men want, though want itself is a strange and shifting thing. The market tells us, if we know how to listen. Like reading entrails or watching the flight of birds, men in offices parse numbers and charts seeking auguries of desire. Once known, these desires become orders. Orders become plans. Plans become schedules. Schedules become reality in factories chosen for their capacity to birth these wants into the world.\n\nI saw this once at Walmart and again at Target. Every movement prescribed, every action written down in books thick as bibles. How to wear the uniform. How to unload the trucks. The whole dance choreographed down to the smallest step, because chaos costs money and time is the only thing you can't buy more of.\n\nThen comes supply, the choices of what to make and what to buy. What to keep close and what to send away. Managers sit in rooms and decide which parts of the work belong to them and which belong to others. They call it outsourcing but really its just a way of making things move faster, like water finding the quickest path downhill. They call this velocity and chase it like men once chased gold, always seeking the perfect balance of quality and cost.",
            "They came in the Victorian age these books and they were filled with things of the aristocracy and details heaped upon details until the words themselves groaned under their own weight. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark tales both of them carrying mystery like a shroud and bearing strangeness in their hearts that set them apart from their kin. This strangeness it gave life to their characters and showed the blackness in their souls and the reasons for what they done.\n\nHe walked in dreams Oliver did between Sikes and Crackit who quarreled like wolves over meat and their voices came to him through the darkness of his mind. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field and lights danced before him while unseen hands bore him away through the chaos. Through it all the pain stayed with him constant as hunger constant as death.\n\nThese dreams they came in both books like dark prophets bearing truth. In Oliver's tale they showed what lay inside him like a man gutted and laid bare showing all the hurt and knowing that filled him. When they shot him and he lived it again in chapter 28 he was powerless as a leaf in the wind. The dream showed how the control had gone out of him like blood from a wound. He could not even see who carried him away and the pain that first shocked him now just stayed with him quiet and terrible like a companion. You could see how the boy was broke down by then like Fagin wanted. Beat down so far he wouldnt even try to save his own life when the time came. The day it went and night came on and the silence stretched out forever while the hours ran like water through his fingers.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces looking up from dogeared books and crumpled papers. Their struggles were many but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy. Adrian they called him. Third or fourth grade, memory fails. The letters on the page before him might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in ancient stone. Some sounds he knew true as sunrise, others escaped him like smoke in the wind. His English flowed pure as mountain water but his people came from south of the border, that much was certain.\n\nWe labored together in that fluorescent-lit room until the day his mother appeared. The other children had gone off somewhere, just a few stragglers remained when she walked in wearing worry like a shawl. No English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish that I barely grasped with my meager learning. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer stroke: The boy could read well enough, just not in the tongue of his adopted land. Whether this knowledge served him after, I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but to speak of the wall that stands between languages in our schools, particularly here in California where the border breathes like a living thing. Sometimes the barrier hides in plain sight. Even a child who speaks English pure as spring water might stumble reading it, like a man trying to cross a river on stones he cannot see. We all know this truth, but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough: teach him the strange shapes that make up English words. But for those who barely grasp our tongue, the answer splinters like light through crystal. No single solution will suffice. Two-language teaching, immersion, private instruction, special English classes - each alone stands weak as a sapling in strong wind. But together they might grow into something that holds.\n\nThe two-language way shows promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking children but for all. Studies tell us these children outpace their peers like wolves outrun sheep. Some fear this wastes what we have, but they're wrong as wrong can be. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all flourish like desert flowers after rain. We don't need every teacher speaking two tongues - that's a fool's errand. But we can find helpers, guides who know both worlds, to bridge the gap between what is and what could be.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A vastness beyond knowing. Some find it in wooden pews and stained glass, others in ancient texts or deep within the hollows of their own hearts. Many take up the faiths of their fathers like old coats passed down, worn thin at the edges but familiar. Others cast off such inheritance entirely, prophets of their own small worlds where nothing exists beyond the reach of their understanding. We wander these paths like blind men feeling their way through darkness, seeking some light to lead us from shadow into day.\n\nHe said cardinal and nothing more. We set on the porch watching the rain beat against tin while smoke rose from our cigarettes like small ghosts in the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain met in the growing dark. The clothes hung from him now like empty flags, his hair thin as winter wheat. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such truth. I moved closer and we watched the June rain fall in the twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nDecember took him five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him bought time but not peace, extending his suffering like some cruel mathematical equation. I questioned what sort of god would author such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers. If there was something out there listening it had turned from me long ago like a friend grown weary of my voice.\n\nI could not watch the ending. Would not. The memory of his life meant more than witnessing its departure. I knew him better than the others, better than those who shared his blood, and knew he would not want his child to stand witness while death took its due. For three days I lay curled in darkness waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline County like a man possessed by the soil itself, this Taylor, his mind ever fixed on the republic and what it might become. The earth spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in both worlds, the dust of legislation settling on his farmer's boots like so much chaff. His devotion to the land colored everything he touched, everything he thought, everything he feared might come to pass.\n\nThe republic stood naked before him, stripped of old world traditions that might have bound it like corpse wrappings. Here was virgin territory not just in soil but in governance and Taylor knew it. He saw how rights given by God or nature or whatever dark force ruled the universe were bound together like a hangman's knot, to fail together or hold fast as one. The government, he reasoned, must never touch these things.\n\nIn those days men spoke of natural states and Taylor knew what that meant. The strong would devour the weak and the clever would feast on both, same as it ever was. But civilization demanded better. Taylor held to his beliefs about good and evil like a man clutching a Bible in a thunderstorm, knowing that any government made by men must carry both seeds within it. Good principles protect what's yours, he said, they make the earth yield its bounty, they keep the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drives all men but only becomes evil when it feeds upon others like a carrion crow.\n\nThe Constitution was his lodestone though he wanted it read pure and clean as spring water. No federal leviathan growing fat on taxes and power, nothing beyond what was writ plain on paper. But words alone were dangerous things, he knew, without the ghost of intention haunting their margins. For Taylor the Declaration was the true testament, the document that spoke of sovereign states standing apart yet together, like stalks of wheat in a field that bend together in the wind but keep their separate roots.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was what he did. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding away at nothing, processing the scene before him without attachment or judgment or understanding. Thoughts came and went like dust devils in the desert, there and gone again before they could take hold.\n\nYears back he'd bought him a book about drawing from the right side of the brain on account of some artist he knew told him to. Since he was no more than a boy he'd wanted to draw and this book laid it all out plain as day from what a pencil was to how the mind saw shapes in the world. It talked about framing things. How you could take the world and cut it down to size with invisible borders. How a kitchen full of things could become just a bowl of fruit floating in space if you knew how to look at it right.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt frame nothing. The sight before him was too vast and terrible in its simple awfulness. Like them painters who went through their phases. Picasso with his blues and Monet with his gardens. If this was art then it was art of the basest kind. A masterwork in brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and his arm moved like it belonged to someone else. The water moved in its ancient circles, clear as crystal and just as cold. Little pieces broke away and vanished into that cold void but the main mass stayed put like some creature born to that porcelain bowl. He flushed again harder this time, desperate-like, but that brown testament to human waste just sat there mocking his efforts.\n\nHe stood there in his uniform, green tie cinched tight at his throat like a noose, holding that mop like it was some kind of talisman against what lay before him. Just another bathroom cleaner at the Rite Aid facing down what some nameless patron had left behind. After a spell he reached for the paper, wrapped his hand in it like them old mummies in Egypt till he couldn't see skin no more. Then slow and careful-like he reached down into them cold waters like reaching into the mouth of hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night moves past like a dark river and carries their souls with it. The government men with their papers and statistics know why but knowing dont stop the dying. They say the brain aint ready. Say its too new and soft for such things as steel horses and velocity. Experience too is missing like some vital organ cut away leaving only an empty space where wisdom should dwell.\n\nThese young ones they drive together. Pack animals sharing metal coffins. The California men who study such things showed in their numbers how death follows youth like a dark companion. State men made laws. Papers that say when they can drive and who they can carry but laws are just words on paper and death pays no mind to such things.\n\nSome say eighteen years aint enough. Zuckerman the head doctor says they seek the thrill like moths to flame caring nothing for the burning. Says we ought to wait till that fire dies down some. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there'll be more. Children of the boom times coming up behind ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nThe answer lies plain as bones in the desert. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let the schools teach them still but keep them from the metal beasts that roam the highways. Let them learn slow and careful like. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows the way of things. Make it the same in all places cause death dont care what state youre in when it comes calling.\n\nThis aint new thinking. Aint nothing that hasnt been thought before by men who've seen too many young ones wrapped in sheets by the roadside. But knowing and doing aint the same thing and we keep on like we always have watching them die in the dark.",
            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder but names dont matter much in the grand scheme of things. The brain takes what it hears and makes nothing of it. Like a broken radio receiver catching fragments of signals from somewhere far off and distant. The sufferers can hear alright. Their ears work just fine. But somewhere in the dark corridors of their mind the meaning gets lost. Gets twisted. Like smoke in the wind.\n\nIt wasnt always known by that name. Back in the old days round about 1950 they called it auditory imperception. Some Italian doctors, Bocca and his people, they started testing children who couldn't make sense of the sounds around them. Then Kimura came along with his theories about how the brain takes in sound from both sides. They had themselves a conference in 77. Started really looking into it.\n\nThe way it manifests is like a shadow across the mind. Some cant tell where a sound comes from, like they're lost in a dark room with voices all around. Others cant tell one sound from another or make sense of patterns in speech. Sarcasm flies right past them like a bullet in the night. Words get jumbled up, meanings lost. Its like their minds are trying to catch raindrops in a sieve.\n\nTo find it in a person they got to do tests. Audiologists and speech doctors watching how people listen, how they respond. Like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it leaves behind. They aint found no single way to catch it sure. No one knows where it comes from neither. They put people through their paces with words and numbers coming at them from all sides at once. Sometimes they stick machines in ears to measure the way the brain dances to sound. But still it remains elusive. Like trying to catch the wind in your hands.",
            "They'd asked me what I aimed to do with my life and I told them plain. Said I meant to work with the children. The broken ones. The ones whose own blood had turned against them like vipers in the dark. Told them I'd walk into the Division of Family Services and take up that mantle. Not for glory. Not for coin. But because there are things in this world that need doing and someone needs doing them.\n\nThe values I carried weren't learned from no book. Service. Respect. The knowing of right from wrong that burns in a man's chest like hot coals. These weren't just words to me. They were like old bones buried deep in the earth. Fundamental. Ancient.\n\nI remember the summer of '09, fresh from Piedmont College with psychology papers in hand, not knowing which way to point my feet. That's when I saw him. Just a boy. Sixteen summers old, sitting scared on my friend's couch like some wounded animal. His folks had done things. Bad things. Things that make God turn his face away.\n\nI drove out to that house the next day after he called the law. Told the police what I knew, showed them my credentials like they meant something. They asked me to talk to the parents, said their hands were tied by the law. Those parents, they spoke in circles and shadows, calling their boy manipulative, trying to make simple what wasn't simple at all. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nAnd justice. Lord, the justice. We talk about individuals like we honor them, but we're all trying to sand down our edges to fit in some box society built. I never did cotton to that. Walked my own path through school, wore what pleased me, colored my hair like wildfire, stuck metal through my flesh because it was mine to do with. Stood up with the GSBA folks, fought the old hatred wherever it showed its face. Because that's what justice is. Not some word in a book, but a thing you do with your hands and your heart and your voice.\n\nSome folks say we're all just dust in the wind. Maybe so. But while we're here, we got work to do. Hard work. And I aim to do it.",
            "Sleep comes like a thief in the night for some and not at all for others. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like a dark specter, casting its shadow across both the biological and sociocultural realms of human suffering. They say it runs in the blood, passed down through generations like an old curse, while others claim it's born of the world we've built around us - the concrete canyons and electric lights that mock the natural order.\n\nThere are those who would categorize sleep's absence, sort it into neat little boxes with names like Dyssomnia and Parasomnia, as if giving the darkness a name might tame it. Primary disorders they call some, while others trail behind other afflictions of the mind like faithful dogs. The sleepless ones pace their nights away, while across town the oversleepers drift through days like ghosts, neither fully here nor gone. Then there are the sleepwalkers and the night screamers, their minds caught in some terrible dance between waking and sleeping.\n\nDeep in the laboratories they keep their mice, watching them sleep and wake, studying the tiny sparks in their brains that decide between consciousness and oblivion. They found something called orexin in the hypothalamus, a messenger that speaks in the language of wake and sleep. The GABAB receptors stand guard like sentinels, and when they're triggered the sleep comes washing over like a dark tide. But if something's wrong with these sentinels, if they're broken or missing, then sleep becomes as elusive as smoke in the wind. They tested this with their chemicals and their mice, watching as the creatures surrendered to artificial sleep, and wrote down their findings in neat columns and graphs as if they'd captured some fundamental truth about the nature of consciousness itself.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The eastern halls where they put me that first year stood at the far reaches of civilization, past which only the great concrete monuments to sport and spectacle rose against the grey Pennsylvania sky. From Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of twenty-five minutes or more, longer still when the weather turned, as it often did in that place they called State College though it was neither state nor college but something else entirely.\n\nAn old graduate told me once how it used to be, the eastern dormitories separated from everything by vast tracts of nothing. Empty land that stretched like some forsaken prairie. Now steel and concrete rise where emptiness once dwelt. The Creamery. The infirmary. Apartment blocks that crowd the horizon like tombstones in some vast necropolis. The campus spreads like a living thing, consuming distance, making movement harder with each passing season. But there is salvation in the bicycle. Simple machine of chains and wheels, useless without riders, worthless without paths to ride.\n\nMy friend spoke to me of bicycles. He had forgotten them for years but remembered now like a man remembering his own hands. Bikes are great, he said, though fashion had turned against them for a time. They endured. A bowl of morning grain and the strength in your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. The mathematics of survival are simple. I live far now, as far as those eastern halls where once I dwelt, but the bicycle saves me. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bicycle devours that distance in five minutes or less if you're willing to push hard enough. Pollock Road cuts straight and true but it's treacherous, full of dangers seen and unseen, wheeled or walking.\n\nSome speak of walking like it's salvation but I cannot spare the time. Without the bicycle there is only walking and walking takes what cannot be given. Forty minutes lost each day to Thomas building alone. Two hours and more each week vanished like smoke. Add the other wanderings, the appointments, the necessities. Time becomes a currency you cannot spend.",
            "He watched as the world burned itself into submission through screens and steel and the false promises of men who wore suits like armor. Huxley had seen it coming. Had written of it in that book of his. Brave New World. A world where the individual was nothing and the mass of humanity everything and all of it controlled by strings pulled by hands unseen.\n\nThe people there lived like cattle. Bred for purpose. Each one conditioned from birth to seek pleasure like addicts seek their next fix. Above them the World Controller moved like some dark god. Puppet master of flesh and bone. Through the lens of Marx you could see the truth of it. The way the classes moved against each other like tectonic plates. Grinding. Crushing. Words like homogeny and reification scattered through the pages like broken glass.\n\nThe false consciousness lay heavy on them all. Like a blanket of fog that wouldn't lift. The common folk kept ignorant of their own chains. Delta. Gamma. Names for sheep who didn't know they were sheep. Their minds filled with hypnopædic whispers telling them to consume. To spend. To want. The Controller watching it all from his tower of ivory and steel.\n\nNo love existed in that world. No depth to any soul. Characters moved through the pages like ghosts. Hollow. Empty. The men spoke of women like they were meat. Pneumatic, they called them. The women no better. All of them rutting like animals without shame. Each class content in their ignorance. Happy slaves to a system that fed them lies with mechanical precision. Consume, it told them. Obey. Stay in line. And they did. God help them they did.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam, where men argued in circles about peace and violence like dogs chasing their own tails. The question hangs heavier now in the air than it did then, like smoke that won't clear. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted their tune from hatred to something like reverence, as if fear had transformed into a strange kind of worship. No one could have known then that a man named Obama, carrying the weight of Muslim blood in his veins, would stand for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's story burns in my mind like a fever dream. The words they write of him stand against the truth like a house built on sand. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise, tells of tribes brought to heel under his sword, of conversions born not of choice but of steel and fire. Yet in these pages they paint him meek as a lamb, a misunderstood soul whom men sought like water in the desert.\n\nThere's something wrong in how they mirror the Christ's works. They tell of mutton and milk multiplied for forty men, as if copying from an older book, stealing glory from an older truth. It's a thievery of miracles, taking the bread of Christ's life and claiming it as their own. The writers craft their tales careful-like, building a false prophet from borrowed stones.\n\nThe stories come down through whispers, through men telling tales of other men telling tales, like smoke signals rising up through generations. Each telling makes the truth more distant, more suspect. They mean these chains of witnesses to strengthen their case but they only weaken it, like a rope frayed by too many hands.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've fashioned this gentle prophet from the clay of lies. History tells us different - speaks of blood and conquest where they speak of peace. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the maze of these carefully crafted stories.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside quick as a snake sheds its skin in the thinking that came after. Like tracks in the desert sand that fade with each passing wind we see the way of it moving further and further from where it began. The world now bears witness to something stirring in men's minds, a new way of seeing that cannot be unseen. There are those who cling to the old ways like a drowning man to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade like dying embers in the night.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing deep as roots in ancient ground. A hunger will rise in them to strip away the false words laid upon the truth like paint on stone, seeking what he who died upon the cross truly meant. Time will pass like water through fingers but what comes will come sure as darkness follows day. The great wheel will turn backward, grinding away the layers of man's invention like rust from old iron until naught remains but what the carpenter's son brought forth from God before others spoke their piece.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the new world and the old, drawing souls in its wake like flotsam in a river, the church will stand. But as the hands of time spin widdershins the many voices that now cry out in His name will fade to one. Where now stand walls between believers they will crumble like adobe in the rain, leaving only the bare earth where once stood monuments to difference.\n\nThe world has seen such turnings before. Rome that once fed Christians to lions knelt before the cross. This land that once bound men in chains now sees them rise to power. So too will come this great undoing in matters of faith, this stripping away of all that was built upon His words until only truth remains. They will learn to read His words like one reads the sky for coming storms, seeking meaning beneath the surface of things.\n\nIn the before time there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which all else flowed. One God, one truth handed down from heaven, and the ancient words writ in blood and fire. When Rome's legions marched into Jerusalem they found a people already split like a lightning-struck tree - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew only toil and prayer.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and unvarnished like a blade left to rust in the rain. Deep in their cores men harbor greed and selfishness that cant be washed clean. They look only to their own betterment and care nothing for those beneath them scrabbling in the dirt. You see it clear as bone in the factory owners and their kind, those who lord over the great mechanical beasts of industry.\n\nThese men, they build their empires on flesh and bone and blood. Their factories rise like iron mountains against the sky, and Sinclair writes of them saying how \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries death in it. The owners know this truth but care nothing for it. They watch their chimneys vomit black poison into God's air and let their sewage run thick with animal waste and worse things, things that have no name.\n\nThe workers are no more than cattle to them. Less than cattle maybe. \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair says, \"there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Men work until their hands bleed and their backs break and then they're cast aside like spent shells. No warning. No mercy. The law dont protect them and never did.\n\nThey lived in Packingtown like prisoners in hell, breathing poison and drinking death. No help would come. The unions that sprouted up were carrion birds feeding on desperate men. These people, these workers, they were slaves in all but name. Sinclair saw it true when he wrote how they were \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" That was the truth of it. Raw and cruel as winter.",
            "In the dark chambers of Poe's mind there lived a poem called Dream-land and he called it among his better works though who can say what constitutes better in the realms of madness and despair. Within its verses he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place, and Mabbott who came after traced it back to Virgil like a man tracking wounded prey across timeworn earth. Virgil knew it as some far northern isle beyond Britain where Greek minds dared not venture, but there was another source closer to Poe's time, for he had developed a powerful hunger for German writers and their words lay heavy in his thoughts.\n\nThe connection runs deep as blood. Karl J. Arndt wrote of it in his testament to literary kinship, speaking of how Poe's words echoed Goethe's like twin bells in a forgotten tower. Goethe himself stood as a titan among men, creator of Faust, that dark drama born in two parts like some bifurcated beast, first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death came calling for its author.\n\nHidden in Faust's second coming was \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and her gift of a goblet to her king. The king, mad with grief and drink, watched his world darken until he too sought death's embrace, casting the goblet into black waters before closing his eyes forever. Here lay the shadow of Poe's own demons, his drinking and his losses mirrored in this German king's despair.\n\nThey were companion pieces though separated by language and ocean, these tales of Thulé. In Dream-land Poe painted landscapes of darkness where ghosts of dead friends wandered like lost cattle on a moonless plain, a world drained of color and hope. It was as if he had walked into Goethe's grief-stricken realm and found it suited him, found it matched the darkness in his own soul.\n\nGoethe's words would have reached Poe through various channels, not least through Tennyson whom Poe regarded with reverence approaching worship. The German's influence spread like wildfire through the literary world of that time, and Poe, ever the watchful crow, would have seen and known and understood.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than that, in the dark recesses of a man's soul where duty and indifference wage their ancient war. In California where the sun beats merciless upon concrete and steel they wrote these words into books of law, these words about punitive damages and what makes a man culpable for the suffering of others.\n\nThe woman Palmer had walked the aisles of D&D Markets that October evening like any other soul seeking sustenance in the fluorescent temple of commerce. The applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the floor like some visceral warning ignored. Wayne had seen it first, told Martin who sat in his office eating his dinner like a king in his castle. Fifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came too with the same words of warning. Martin dismissed them both with the casual cruelty of a man who had forgotten what it meant to care for the safety of others.\n\nThe clock marked half past five when Palmer's feet went out from under her and she lay broken on the cold tile floor, her back twisted by gravity and neglect. Before her there had been others, five souls who had fallen in that same year, their accidents recorded in ledgers that spoke of liability and loss.\n\nThe question before the judge was one of malice, that dark flower that blooms in the heart of men. The law speaks of oppression and fraud but what transpired in that store was something older. Martin had known of the danger, had been told twice of the threat that lay waiting. He had known of the five who fell before, yet he chose to sit and eat while danger lurked in his domain. The law calls this conscious disregard, this willful turning away from the probability of harm.\n\nIn the end the judge would have to weigh these things: the repeated warnings ignored, the history of falls that came before, the casual dismissal of duty that spoke of something deeper than mere negligence. The law provides for punishment when malice can be shown, when a man knows the consequences of his inaction and chooses still to let others suffer. And in this case the evidence lay clear as blood on sand.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a starved thing. It came upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a dark passenger riding the hollow spaces between heartbeats. Three years gone and still it lingered. Not a thing but a someone, she reckoned, though no boy had stirred that deep well within. They came and went like autumn leaves, their awkward advances scattered by winds they could not name. She pondered this strangeness in the dark hours, this emptiness that defied the natural order of young girls. Years of thinking brought nothing but shadows of answers, yet still she carried on, the question burning like a coal in her chest.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world. They lived without the thunder of argument save for when their daughter's wild spirit pulled against the reins of their quiet ways. She was their opposite star, burning bright and wild where they glowed steady, yet carrying their kindness like an inheritance.\n\nBut this day the peace broke. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed, she heard her mother's cry cut the air like a blade. Kitchen-ways, where the sound died quick as it was born. She ran, heart hammering against her ribs. Mama lay twisted on the tile, pain writing itself across her face in cursive lines. Words came broken and scattered between breaths. Hospital, she said. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering the strength learned in other seasons. She lifted her mother like a child might lift a wounded bird, gentle despite the urgency burning in her blood.\n\nThe hospital air carried its own scripture of antiseptic and suffering, though she paid it no mind. Her world had narrowed to the weight in her arms, the need to find help. She called out and white-clad figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother into the fluorescent depths of those sterile halls. Left alone, she sat with worry gnawing at her bones.\n\nAll this because of a vase too high, a stepping stool too treacherous. The highest cabinet had won its silent war with gravity, and her mother had paid the price.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, promised less death from the heart's betrayals and the brain's dark hemorrhages. They called it aMed, this scoring of sustenance, marking the consumption of what grows from earth and tree, the fish that swim in waters both warm and cold, the pressing of olives for their oil. They shunned the flesh of beasts and the white fat that runs like tallow.\n\nThe knowledge wasn't new. Others before had tracked the dying, counted the fallen to the old ways versus the new. They found fewer corpses among those who ate as their ancestors did along those ancient shores. The fat ones, given choice between this old way and the modern lean, shed their burden better when they followed the path of olive and grape.\n\nThey watched the nurses, seventy-four thousand and more, women who tended the sick and dying across eleven states of this American empire. For twenty years they watched them, marking their eating six times over, through papers filled with boxes and numbers, validating their truth through hospital records and death certificates. They tracked the heart's failings and the brain's betrayals, confirmed in sterile rooms or on cold metal tables. Some they called probable, these casualties of modern life, when papers couldn't be found but the death was certain all the same.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills, the monthly blood of women and the medicines they took when it ceased, the running and walking and moving through time. They built models of numbers, trying to separate truth from coincidence, adjusting for the chaos of human existence.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke clear as bones. Twenty years of watching showed two thousand heart failures, seventeen hundred strokes, a thousand dead from hearts and brains combined. Those who followed the old ways, who scored highest in their adherence to olive and fish and grain, they died less. The numbers said it plain - their risk was less by nearly a third compared to those who ate the modern way.\n\nThe truth was there in the counting of the dead.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood alone at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, the black letters stark against the pale surface. Burma they called it now though some remembered Myanmar, that place of green jungle and red earth where men in uniform had taken what wasnt theirs to take. They had come in the night in 1962 with their rifles and their papers and their proclamations and when morning came the old way was gone.\n\nThe monks came first. Orange robed and barefoot they walked the streets in their thousands, silent in their protest like burning autumn leaves caught in a windless day. Saffron Revolution, the papers called it. As if revolution could be named like a child or a beloved pet. The people watched and then they too came forth but the men in uniform had waited long enough. They came with their guns and their boots and their ancient rage. They broke down monastery doors and dragged the monks into the street. Foreign men with cameras disappeared into cells never to return. One day they shot a Japanese man named Kenji Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. The official count said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different tales. Several thousand, he said. Several thousand souls.\n\nThis was an old story told new. Since men first gathered in tribes there were those who would rule by fear and blood. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who called themselves gods. Even now in America men in suits spoke to other men in suits about power and control and the divine right of presidents.\n\nThe stories piled up like cordwood. Tiananmen Square where students fell by hundreds or thousands depending on who told the tale. Rwanda where Hutu killed Tutsi until the streets ran red. Hitler and his Third Reich building death into an industry. The world turned and turned and nothing changed except the names of the dead.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington lived in the long years of his craft and in how he shaped the men who played for him like a sculptor shapes clay. His fingers on ivory keys whispered soft and low through the pieces we speak of here but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant and waiting. He built frameworks of sound like a carpenter builds the bones of a house, letting the soloists wander through the rooms he created, their instruments crying out in the night like lost souls seeking redemption. The framework held them but did not bind them and in this way the music lived and breathed like something wild yet contained.\n\nHe knew each man's sound like a father knows his son's voice. Knew how the brass would weep and how the reeds would sing and how they would all come together in the dark of the night when the music called them home. In this knowing he wrote pieces that would echo through time like footsteps in an empty hall.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of holy scripture, telling how he made the human voice into something that was both more and less than human. The piece moves slow like molasses in winter, twelve bars stretching out across six choruses like six days of creation. First comes the voice and reeds speaking to each other like lovers in the dark, then the trumpet crying out muted and blue as midnight. The clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The band rises up like a congregation in prayer, brass and reed calling back and forth across the divide. In the fifth chorus everything comes together like judgment day, reeds calling high and brass answering with thunder. Then back to the beginning, voice and reed once more, but now the voice growls like something caught between heaven and hell.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered recorded when the calendar turned again, Miley's trumpet speaks in tongues while Baby Cox's voice answers in sounds that might have been words in some forgotten language. It Don't Mean a Thing brings Nanton's trombone moaning low and sweet like a lost soul finally finding its way home. All of it bearing Ellington's mark like cattle branded on the range, each piece carrying his signature written in notes instead of ink.",
            "The shells speak their own truth and man has long sought to understand their language. They spiral in the darkness of time like ancient scrolls waiting to be read. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we had not yet begun to dream in numbers when looking at living things and his words echo still through the halls of science like a ghost that won't rest.\n\nThe mathematics of life and death reside in these calcium tombs we call shells. They wind their way through space like cosmic dancers following rules we barely comprehend. We took the genus Prunum, those small white prophets of the sea, and laid them bare under the X-ray's merciless eye. The machine called CerioShell consumed our numbers and spat forth possibilities - shapes that could be, shapes that never were, shapes that might yet come to pass in the slow grinding of evolution's wheel.\n\nThe shell is nothing more than a tomb that grows. It spirals through time and space like a creature possessed, marking its passage in degrees, each revolution a testament to its existence. These turns we call whorls, spinning around an axis invisible as God. The columella stands as a pillar of calcium, bearing witness to the creature's passage through time. Each whorl speaks to its neighbor across a line we name suture, though it sutures nothing. The final whorl carries the living flesh within its curved walls, while above it the spire reaches toward heaven like a cathedral's tower.\n\nThey can be viewed from all angles - apex to base, face-on or turned away - but their truth remains encrypted in calcium and time. To count their whorls is to count their days, marking each quarter turn like the phases of some molluscan moon. The aperture traces its path through space like a soul leaving its mark on the world, each moment captured in coordinates of flesh and shell.\n\nThese are the mathematics of life itself, numbers that dance on the edge of comprehension. By understanding their dance we might glimpse the face of evolution itself, though it turns away from our gaze like a shy child. The shells wait, patient as stone, for us to learn their language.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay quiet in their graves these past ten years, their numbers unchanging like ancient stones in a barren field. The nation moved forward in some ways, yes, bringing water where there was none and cleaning filth where it festered, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same, their blood seeping into earth that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey had their midwives now, seven out of ten births blessed with hands that knew something of bringing life into the world. But these women, these traditional healers with their ancient knowledge, they stood helpless when the real darkness came, when the blood flowed like river water and death stalked the birthing rooms. The numbers told a story but it was a story written in half-truths and shadows.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies from their mothers' wombs when they must, clean knives and sterile rooms, but in the villages they did not. Could not. The difference between urban and rural was the difference between life and death, seven percent versus two, numbers that meant everything and nothing at all. And the poor, they suffered worst of all, as they always had and always would, twenty-seven percent less likely to see a doctor's face or feel a healer's touch.\n\nThe question that remained was as old as suffering itself: how to stop the dying. Some said to build programs, targeted and precise like a rifleman's bullet. These programs would show results quick and clean, numbers to please the men who counted such things. But there was a darkness in this path too. When money flowed to one place it dried up in another, like a river changing course, leaving death in its wake. And the paperwork, endless as desert sand, forms upon forms upon forms, a tower of babel built of bureaucracy while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like some dark vine stretching across a century of human experience, its tendrils reaching into places where no classification could follow. Within its twisted branches lay the subspecies, bastard children of rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning their own mutant offspring until the vine became a forest unto itself.\n\nAmong these dark woods stood Heavy Metal like some ancient and terrible god, its presence felt these forty years past. It spoke in tongues of rage and despair and sometimes in whispers of things men ought not speak of. The people who found this god began to shape it, to carve from its flesh new idols, each more terrible than the last, until the very meaning of the thing became lost in its own shadow.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured like a broken mirror, each shard reflecting something different yet the same. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, to the movement itself, for it was never just music but something older, something that lived in the blood.\n\nMetal was born in darkness and nursed on violence. More, always more. More thunder in the bass, more screaming in the night, more blood on the altar. The players were priests of their craft, their fingers dancing across strings like witch doctors working ancient magicks. In those days the drugs came like a flood, mid-seventies, turning men's minds to vapor and their music to something from beyond the veil. They made records that spoke in tongues, hiding behind chemical ghosts and electrical storms. The darkness they brought forth was new and terrible and true, not like the sugared lies that filled the airwaves. They reached back through time to the Romantic dead and pulled forth something primal, something that had always waited there in man's heart.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their warped canvases there was another who walked alone. Henri Rousseau. He crafted dreams both sleeping and waking and laid them bare on canvas like prophets of old inscribing visions on stone. The Dream he called it, this thing of 1910, this testimony to wonder and terror both. In it a woman lies pale and naked on a velvet couch while dark jungle things watch her from the shadows with eyes like burning coals. The painting spoke to more than just the scene it showed. It spoke to Rousseau's own hunger, his desperate wanting. Recognition. Acceptance. The validation of men who dealt in paint and canvas like priests dealing in salvation.\n\nHe was born in Laval in the year 1844 when the world was younger and simpler and his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived as the middle folk lived. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls like some ancient ferryman of souls, though they called him douanier, a title that wasnt his to claim. His first wife Clémence died and before her eight babies that never drew breath proper and in the end there was only Julia left to him. Grief sat heavy on him like a crown of thorns and he turned to painting like a drunk turns to whiskey, seeking something to fill the void that death had carved in him.\n\nHe painted in the time of giants. While Matisse and his kind sought to break the old ways like mirrors in which they saw reflections they could not abide, Rousseau wanted only to join their ranks. To be counted among them. He who had no learning and no credentials save what the years had given him. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared convention like it was a poison in his veins while Rousseau chased it like a man dying of thirst chases a mirage in the desert. The truth of it was written in every brushstroke, every color laid down by hands that had come too late to art but would not be denied their chance to speak.",
            "The old ones spoke of truth and beauty like twins born of the same darkness, bound in blood and breath. Keats knew it. Wrote it on paper that yellowed and crumbled but the words stayed true as bone. Beauty is truth, truth beauty. Nothing more to know in this world or the next.\n\nWe learn what we learn. Through books and through pain and through the long dark nights of experience. But the knowing of right and wrong, of what shimmers with grace and what falls dead and cold - that comes from somewhere deeper. Some cavern in the soul that no light ever touched. We try to speak of it, to capture it in words like butterflies in a killing jar, but it escapes. Always it escapes.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa. Men speak of shadow and light, of technique and history, but these words are just wind. They dont touch the heart of it. Ask a man why he loves a painting or a story and watch him struggle like a wounded animal. Theres just something about it, he'll say, and in those words lies more truth than in all the critics' tomes.\n\nO'Connor knew. You tell a story because nothing else will do. Because some truths cant be spoken plain. They need the cover of fiction like a man needs shelter in a storm. The same with right and wrong. Wittgenstein saw it too. Ethics cant be caught in the net of language. It lives in that space between words where meaning drowns.\n\nThe connection runs deep as marrow. Art and morality touch us in places we cant name, like ghosts passing through walls. Literature carries this burden heaviest of all. McKean said it true - you cant separate the story from the moral any more than you can separate the blood from the vein. Values run through words like rivers through a landscape, carving deeper channels with each passing year. This is why we read. This is why we write. To touch that nameless thing that lives in the spaces between what we can say and what we know to be true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, a thing unified and terrible in its strength, its culture bleeding through the veins of earth from the shadowed peaks of München down to where Kiel meets the cold Baltic waters. This same blood runs west to east, from where Köln squats by the Rhine through the heartland to Dresden's stone shoulders against the Elbe. That such a beast should spring from many heads surprises none who know its past.\n\nGermania. The old ground. The name itself carries wars in its syllables, disputed by men who make their trade in dead words and older bones. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of northern shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, those who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their original name - Germans - stuck like dried blood to history's pages. Caesar, that first namer of things beyond Rome's reach, took the word Germanus from Gaulish tongues and used it to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, though others trace it to the ger, that spear they carried into battle, or to garim, that Irish word for shouting, as if the Germans were nothing but noise and fury given flesh.\n\nTacitus wrote in his ninety-eighth year after their Christ that these people must have sprung from the earth itself, pure and unmixed, for what man would cross seas to reach such a place of wild darkness and bitter skies unless he had been born to it. The land itself rejected strangers.\n\nAnd the Romans, those builders of empires, they came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry and sometimes leaving their dead. The Germanic tribes appeared like wolves at the empire's edges, trading what they took from the land and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions not their own. They were becoming what they would be, though they did not know it then.",
            "The play speaks of masks and shadows, of the way men and women wrap themselves in false skins like snakes shedding what God gave them. And in the end they must cast off these skins or be lost to them forever, their souls drifting like smoke in the dark spaces between what is and what seems to be. But the casting off brings its own darkness. Some will turn away. Some will bare their teeth. Some will forgive and some will not and in the end each must choose between the truth of self and the bonds that tie them to the world of men.\n\nWhen woman becomes man the question comes unbidden like a thief in the night. Why. Why does she turn from what the Lord made her to be. Viola speaks of preservation, of survival in a world gone wrong. The captain who helped her speaks gentle words but the world does not. I'll bring you to a captain in this town where lie my maiden weeds, she says, as if those clothes could shield her from the wolves that walk on two legs.\n\nShe walks as a man among men but the price is isolation, cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. And the deception breeds more deception like maggots in summer meat. Olivia sees in her what she wishes to see. Whither my lord, Cesario husband stay, she cries out, while Orsino speaks words that carry weight like stones: Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n\nThe modern eye might see something else entirely in this masquerade of flesh and bone. Might see how the lies peel back layers of truth like skin from an orange. Olivia and Orsino both carry secrets in their hearts dark as river bottom mud. When Olivia looks upon Cesario does she see man or woman or something that dwells in the spaces between. But Shakespeare cares not for such modern thoughts. His Olivia is a mirror held up to those who judge by flesh alone, who see only what their eyes tell them to see.\n\nAt the last she turns from Cesario to Sebastian as easy as wind changes direction. A sister you are she, she says, and blood ties replace what was never love but only its shadow.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing of nightmares that left the Ovaherero and Nama dead in its wake. But empires aint simple things and this one stretched across worlds unknown, each territory carrying its own weight of history like a stone. In the east they found Africans who could read and write when the British came in 1919, taking what the Germans had built. In Kamerun too the natives had learned their letters and numbers, or so they said in those days.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A place where the wind carried death across the desert and the missionaries did what the government would not. They taught the natives while the state turned its back, saving its coins and care for the white children who sat in proper schools with proper teachers. The missionaries got what scraps fell from the government's table and nothing more. This was how it went and how it would go, marking the land long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies raised up educated men, South West Africa's people remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe old books tell it, most in German, written when the empire still breathed. They wrote of schools and systems, of how things were done in those days. Later came the English writers who picked through the bones of the dead empire, comparing one colony to another like a man comparing cattle at market. Cohen wrote of it too, said the whites who settled there made it what it was, different from the east where fewer Europeans made their homes.\n\nThe land itself was neither kind nor cruel, temperate they called it though the desert stretched endless and bare. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come to stay, more than anywhere else in the German territories. In East Africa there were only five thousand or so. The numbers told their own story, but numbers aint always truth.",
            "They rode forth across that disputed ground, these two nations, like ancient enemies circling one another in the dust and heat of fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three they clashed and bled, the high water mark coming in forty-six when American forces descended like biblical locusts upon Mexican soil, claiming Texas and the Southwest territories in a tide of manifest destiny that knew no bounds.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all nations sharing such scars upon the earth they fought over God and custom and the old ways of their fathers, though perhaps they knew not why. Their hatred was a thing passed down from the English and Spanish crowns, ancient as the stones themselves, deep as the waters that divided their lands.\n\nSeventeen times did these nations clash proper in those years, though countless smaller skirmishes dotted the borderlands like stars in the night sky. Bandits and mercenaries crossed back and forth across that imaginary line drawn in blood, raiders striking at settlements while good men slept. The frontier was a lawless thing then, untamed and wild as the hearts of the men who sought to claim it.\n\nThe old Catholic ways of Mexico stood in stark opposition to the Protestant fervor of the Americans, much as fascism and communism would divide nations in the century to come. But all things must end. As the century waned like a dying fire, Mexico found itself bound to American interests not by conquest but by coin. The hunger for land gave way to the hunger for profit, and the old blood feuds faded like tracks in the desert sand, though the memories remained, etched deep in the bones of both peoples.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I hadn't known such illness existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it from some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd say it like gospel: People gonna stay sick, always need tending to. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the white uniform like a shield against what might come.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years walked on this earth, alone, pockets empty as a church on Monday, body betraying everything I'd built. Still am that way. After fifteen years living off government mercy ain't nothing left to call mine except breath and bone. Each sunrise brings its own war against security, dignity, whatever scraps of pride remain. Nothing certain no more except one truth hard as stone: Wouldn't have survived without blood kin and them few friends stood fast. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No deed to safety exists in this world no matter how careful you lay your plans. Some storms too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThis country needs weaning off the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust each other again than dig our separate holes in the ground waiting for judgment.\n\nThey talk about rugged individuals built this land. Truth is it was built on shared bread and borrowed tools. Them pioneer wagons didn't cross them mountains alone. Was communities moving west together, sharing what they had.\n\nKeep your preparations. Got my own kit - medical supplies, water tablets, window plastic and tape against whatever poison might come floating down. Flashlights and batteries lined up like soldiers. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods stacked in rows. You got land, plant it. Got wood, burn it.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbor's name. Might be the hand that pulls you through.",
            "In the old world there was a prince. Born to wealth and station in a time before Christ walked the earth. He who would become the Buddha. The prince walked away from all he knew and found enlightenment beneath a tree and from his teachings came the thing men would call Buddhism and within it the orthodox strain known as Theravada. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion aint what it was. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year, monks and common folk alike gathered for some ritual the Buddha never spoke of nor ordained. The changes run deep as bone. From the surface down into the marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have worked changes in their doctrine like a smith works iron, bending to forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all.\n\nWords have weight here and must be measured careful. There are forces inside and forces outside. Inside being them that follow the Buddhasasana whether they wear the robe or no. Outside being all others who dont. Some forces come with malice burning in their hearts like coal and seek to tear down what Buddha built. Others pass by like wind neither helping nor harming though their passing may leave marks all the same. These words will echo through what follows like footfalls in an empty hall.\n\nYou got to know what lies at the heart. The three jewels they call the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma itself held in three baskets of ancient text. The Suttas which tell the tales, the Vinaya which sets the rules, and the Abhidhamma which speaks of things beyond the world we know. They talk of Anatta which means the soul aint real, and Dukkha which means life is suffering, and Anicca which means nothing lasts. A man must know these things deep in his gut if he aims to break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and birth that turns and turns without end. When the wheel stops turning then desire and hatred and confusion stop too. The Vinaya tells men how to live. Common folk got five rules: dont kill, dont lie, dont steal, dont rut like animals, dont poison yourself with drink or drugs. Monks got more rules than stars in the sky. But at the center of it all like the hub of some great wheel are the four noble truths. First that life is pain. Second that wanting causes pain. Third that pain can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table.

            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Fitzgerald he knew the way of such things when he wrote his tale of Gatsby. He would take words that had no business being together and wed them like strange desert creatures coupling in the night. Or he would take a thing, simple as it was, and make it speak for something else entirely. Colors were his chosen tokens. Gold and green and white and gray and red like old blood dried in the sun. In The Great Gatsby these colors became more than what they were. White and gray and shades of pink became messengers carrying whispers of meaning through the pages.\n\nThe white and gray spoke of sameness, of things worn down by time and circumstance until they were all one thing. White carried itself higher, wore better clothes, spoke with practiced words. Gray was its poor relation, faded and tired and used up. Fitzgerald scattered these like bones in a dead land. Everywhere the white showed itself. Daisy and Jordan forever wrapped in white like ghosts haunting the edges of sight. Nick in his white flannels moving through Gatsby's carnival of excess. Tom buttoned up in white when he went to his woman. Catherine with her skin powdered white as desert salt. Only at Gatsby's gathering did the white give way, there where the walls blazed with colors crude as fresh kill.\n\nThe meaning sank deeper. The writer cast his net of white and gray across all common things. The canyons of New York stood white and dead as bleached bones. The names of Gatsby's people faded to gray marks on paper.

Even the child by the tracks and the old man with his dogs wore gray like a second skin.\n\nThen Fitzgerald turned these colors into weapons. When Daisy appears again she comes dressed in white, driving white, becoming not a woman but a thing uniform and empty as blown smoke. A prize Gatsby chased across the years.

Touch and heat and sound and light, all transformed by flesh into something the brain can read like old signs in the desert. The mind works its algorithms like a butcher works meat, bottom to top and top to bottom again. Take the black box sitting in whiteness. The bottom-working mind sees first the color and the edges where darkness meets light, while the top-working mind already knows what boxes are and makes the seeing faster, though sometimes it lies to itself about whether the box is truly there or if it's just a hole cut in the white.\n\nThere's a sentinel in the mind that sorts what matters from what don't. Like a man standing guard at a door, letting some thoughts pass and turning others away. Your feet might crush a thousand blades of grass but the guard won't let you count them. Yet your name spoken across a crowded room will reach your ears like a bullet finding its mark. The guard works always, sorting and resorting what comes through.\n\nMemory is a graveyard of moments, some fresh as new-dug graves, others ancient as bone. The mind takes what it sees and hears and marks it like a rancher brands cattle. Words get marked three ways - by their shape like tracks in sand, by their sound like echo in canyon walls, and by their meaning like old stories passed down. Some memories live brief as mayflies, dancing their twenty seconds in electric circles through the brain. Others bed down deep in the protein and sinew, making homes in the flesh itself.\n\nThey say knowledge is stored like a web of iron strings, each thought connected to others by rust-worn cables of meaning. Chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on until the web spreads out like the highways of some mad god's kingdom. But these are just stories we tell ourselves in the dark, trying to make sense of the machinery behind our eyes.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets turned belly up like dead fish in a poisoned stream, the bones of American enterprise bleaching under a merciless economic sun. Men who had built empires of paper and promise watched them scatter like autumn leaves in a cold wind. The unemployment came first, then the houses stood empty, their windows dark eyes staring at nothing, their owners gone like ghosts into the gathering dark.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been planted in older times, in the days when Clinton held court in the white house. The man had wanted power like all men want power and he had loosened the bonds that held the money-lenders in check. They came like locusts then, these bankers with their papers and their promises, offering salvation in the form of loans to those who had no means to pay them back. Fannie Mae and her twisted sister Freddie Mac danced to this tune, packaging poison as medicine, selling death as life.\n\nThe mortgages they crafted were strange beasts, chimeras with many heads and poisoned teeth. They called them adjustable-rate, called them securities, called them obligations, but they were snares all the same. The people mortgaged their futures and their children's futures, building houses of cards in a windstorm, never seeing the darkness gathering at the edges of their dreams.\n\nWhen the storm came it came with the fury of an old testament god. The great houses of money fell like dominoes in the night. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold their souls for copper pennies. Lehman Brothers vanished like smoke. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley bent their proud necks to the government's yoke. Five trillion dollars of debt hung like a millstone around the neck of the nation, and the government gathered up the broken pieces of Fannie and Freddie like a parent collecting the remains of wayward children.\n\nThey had built their house upon sand, and when the tide came in it washed away all their certainties, leaving only ruin and regret in its wake.",
            "The exposition comes like a thief in the night. Silent and unwanted. Writers who fancy themselves gods of their craft spread their wings like broken angels thinking their words will lift them to some heaven of prose but there aint no such place. Only the quiet damnation of readers who curse your name into the dark of their screens and turn away forever.\n\nThe old doctor would rail against such things. Screaming at pages filled with nothing but words that mean nothing. Information spilled like blood on sand. Useless. Gone.\n\nShow dont tell. That's what they say. But the devil rides both shoulders whispering sweet poison. Tell them everything, he says. Tell them of histories that dont matter. Tell them of childhoods long dead. Tell them until there aint nothing left to tell.\n\nExposition is just words about other words. In the moving pictures they got folk telling other folk things that dont need telling. Like that old mariner with his endless tale. In books its worse. Writers become preachers of their own gospel.\n\nTake the story of a woman and her dead man. You could say they met and loved and married and he died. You could say it quick like that. But where's the truth in it. Where's the way his eyes caught the light when he looked at her. Where's the sound of her laugh when he told them fool jokes of his. Where's the way the bullet took him. The way she screamed. The way the blood looked black in the moonlight. That's the meat of it. That's what makes it real.\n\nSometimes a writer wants to tell you everything about a man. That he flew planes in some war. That he works nights at a gas station now. That he been married twice but got no kids to show for it. That he likes to fish and dreams of owning that station someday. That he ate some fancy eggs this morning. But what good is knowing all that if you dont know the man himself. If you cant see the weight of all them failed dreams in his eyes. If you cant smell the gasoline on his clothes. If you cant feel the loneliness eating at him like rust on an old chain.",
            "The morning came dark and cold across the Ohio plains and with it the news of violence that plagues all men. On the screen they showed a man's face, hollow-eyed and vengeful, one Shad Hostettler who had taken blade to wife in Ashley. The newsmen spoke little of it, their words sparse as winter wheat, moving on like carrion birds to fresh killing grounds.\n\nThey told of a boy shot down in Sharon Woods, Travis Buyers by name, eighteen years on this earth before the bullets found him. The SWAT men moved through the streets like black-clad prophets but found nothing. The boy was black and the news passed over him quick as a shadow, the way it always does with such folk, while white victims draw the cameras like moths to flame, their stories told and retold until they echo through the empty spaces of the morning broadcasts.\n\nA tale came then of a flying machine, a mercy ship pierced by lead, the small caliber round having punched through its metal skin like judgment from below. Five thousand dollars promised for the shooter's name, though such men rarely come forward in the light.\n\nThe weatherman spoke of rain and thunder, his words a incantation against the coming storm, the numbers of degrees meaningless in the face of what nature would bring.\n\nThey showed footage of a robbery, dwelling overlong on the darkness of the perpetrator's skin as if evil wore only one shade. Six foot tall they said he was, wearing death's own hood, moving through the UDF store like a specter of want.\n\nLast came the story of Rodriguez, a Mexican who'd moved plants north for profit until the law caught him. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if counting it slow made the time more real. His heritage they mentioned like it was a crime itself, though drugs know nothing of borders or blood.",
            "They call it an ETF and it moves like some spectral thing through the markets tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets that men have fashioned from numbers and dreams. It trades like stock but carries within it multitudes. Like some dark promise it offers what mutual funds cannot - the ability to sell short and buy on margin and purchase but a single share should that be all you possess.\n\nThe benefits lay there like bleached bones in the financial desert, stark and undeniable. Lower expense ratios than any mutual fund could claim. Yet darkness lurks at the edges for there are commissions to be paid, blood money for every trade like some ancient toll to cross the river of commerce.\n\nThey come in endless varieties these ETFs, each one different from the last but all bound by the same rules, the same principles that govern their existence. A man might question whether the benefits they tout - diversification chief among them - are real or merely mirages shimmering in the heat of market speculation.\n\nWe set our sights on one called IHF, to parse its essence against the ten largest holdings within it. To determine if owning the one could match owning the many, or if some better configuration might exist, like finding a new path through old territory.\n\nThe task demanded focus. To include every holding would be to lose oneself in a maze of numbers. So we took the top ten, accounting for 63.58 percent of the whole, like taking the measure of a man by his strongest features.\n\nThe calculations stretched before us like a map of some ancient territory, each figure a landmark in understanding how these ten stocks stood in for the whole of IHF. We normalized their percentages to 100, as if adjusting a compass to true north, and measured their contributions to Beta and Return as if weighing gold on scales.\n\nThe numbers spoke clear as desert stars - the return of the ten exceeded the ETF by 6.11 percent, a difference of 16 percent in total. The Beta ran lower by .12, like tracking softer footprints in the sand. Yet questions remained about whether these differences carried true statistical weight, or were merely phantoms in the financial wilderness.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter itself had reached in and torn the heart from our endeavor. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough. The New England cold come down like judgment, driving the bicycles to their hooks and the walkers to their cars, but that wasnt all of it. Not by half. December brought its own demons - papers to grade and tests to mark and the whole machinery of education grinding toward semester's end. The log books lay forgotten like dead leaves.\n\nThe holiday season stretched out before them all like some dark road with no end in sight. Students scattered like quail to their homes, faculty too, the campus standing empty and dead beneath the winter sky. When they returned in January the cold had settled deep in the bones of the earth and February showed no mercy neither. You could say the project started with fire in its belly but fire needs feeding and we had let it die down to embers. We conjured up what we called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, like some carnival medicine show come to town, and it worked after a fashion. The numbers rose again but the truth of it was we were fighting more than just the seasons and the academic calendar. We were fighting time itself and time always wins.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. The car is freedom and freedom runs in the blood like whiskey. We tried to tempt them away with prizes. Gift cards for coffee and food, massages, books. But a man or woman behind the wheel of their own automobile is like God himself deciding when and where to go and that's a hard thing to trade for a free lunch. Later we wondered if bigger prizes might have turned the tide. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars with their silent engines and their promise of virtue. If we had played it different, saved the big prizes for when the winter came down and the spirit flagged, maybe the numbers would have told a different story. But maybes are like prayers - sometimes they get answered and sometimes they just drift away on the wind.",
            "I sat there in the dim light watching them old Edison reels spin, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901, all of them trick films they called them. Magic made of light and shadow and lies. The illusions danced across the screen like specters from some forgotten carnival, each one bound by rules old as theatre itself.\n\nThey were prison films in their way, trapped in boxes of their own making. Set-bound and frontal like some ancient proscenium arch in a dead man's playhouse. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, bearing testament to the conjurer's craft through long shots and medium frames, each film a singular moment stretched thin across time's cruel axis.\n\nYet some of them, those that came with the turning of the century, they dared. They broke free of their chains, splitting themselves into multiple shots like some cinematic hydra.\n\nThe stage held them all, these phantoms. Interior sets built like coffins for the living, the camera fixed and staring like death itself. No following of figures here, no chase through depths of field. This was vaudeville's bastard child, born in the womb of magic shows and carnival tents. The players moved like marionettes on invisible strings, side to side, never daring to approach the glass eye that watched them. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900, they shuffled across the frame like condemned men, entering stage right, moving in their horizontal dance of the damned.\n\nThe proscenium arch was their master and their god. Long shots and medium shots were its prophets, but close-ups were heresy, forbidden fruit in this garden of illusions. Like theatre-goers of old, we watched from afar, never permitted to breach that sacred distance between performer and witness.\n\nOne shot, one film. That was the law of their world, binding these spectral performances to mere minutes of life. Stories were sparse things here, stripped down to base trickery - disappearances, transformations, the stuff of street corner magicians and carnival barkers. But even in these simple deceptions lay deeper truths. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, birthed in 1895, hid its secrets in plain sight. Look close enough and you can see where they stitched together the lie, where Mary's head wasn't Mary's head at all, though to the innocent eye it all flows like water over stone, one continuous stream of terrible truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both ancient and new, a paradox of time itself, like bones bleached white in the desert sun yet still holding the marrow of life within. Ian Watt called it what it was, this thing that breathed both old and fresh air, praised and damned in the same breath by those who would judge such things. They spoke of its emptiness while others saw in it something terrible and sublime, like Burke did, though perhaps he knew not what darkness truly dwelt there.\n\nWhen Walpole birthed The Castle of Otranto into this world he did what no man had done before, taking the ancient romances and the modern ones too and binding them together with blood and ink and shadow. He reached back into the theater of old times, into the stone and mortar of medieval walls, into traditions that lay like dead things but weren't dead at all. The word gothic itself had wandered like a vagrant through time, marking peoples and places and ways of being until it came to rest here, in these pages, in these stories that some called crude and others called revelation.\n\nThe chivalry of old times runs through these tales like a dark river beneath the earth. In Otranto it flows strong and deep, carrying with it the ghosts of knights long dead, their honor and their steel both rusted but somehow still sharp. Walpole saw his world, saw the men in it who called themselves noble, and found them wanting. He looked back to times when honor meant something more than words spoken in parliamentary halls, when blood spilled meant something sacred.\n\nAnd there was Frederic, written onto the page like a man carved from older stone. A prince who had known suffering, who had walked with death in foreign lands where infidels waited with sharp steel and sharper faith. The writers made him more than man, made him legend, excess piled upon excess until he stood like a mountain of chivalric virtue, terrible in his perfection.",
            "They call it supply chain management and it moves like a river through the world. From raw earth to finished good, from order to delivery, all of it flowing through the hands of men who may never meet nor know each others names. Keith Oliver gave it that name in 1982 though the thing itself existed long before any man thought to name it. He wrote of planning and control and efficiency but these were just words for an older thing. A thing as old as trade itself.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Each one a world unto itself, each one bearing the weight of commerce like ancient columns in some forgotten temple to trade.\n\nProduction stands first among them. Without it there is nothing. It begins with knowing what men want, though want itself is a strange and shifting thing. The market tells us, if we know how to listen. Like reading entrails or watching the flight of birds, men in offices parse numbers and charts seeking auguries of desire. Once known, these desires become orders. Orders become plans. Plans become schedules. Schedules become reality in factories chosen for their capacity to birth these wants into the world.\n\nI saw this once at Walmart and again at Target. Every movement prescribed, every action written down in books thick as bibles. How to wear the uniform. How to unload the trucks. The whole dance choreographed down to the smallest step, because chaos costs money and time is the only thing you can't buy more of.\n\nThen comes supply, the choices of what to make and what to buy. What to keep close and what to send away. Managers sit in rooms and decide which parts of the work belong to them and which belong to others. They call it outsourcing but really its just a way of making things move faster, like water finding the quickest path downhill. They call this velocity and chase it like men once chased gold, always seeking the perfect balance of quality and cost.",
            "They came in the Victorian age these books and they were filled with things of the aristocracy and details heaped upon details until the words themselves groaned under their own weight. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark tales both of them carrying mystery like a shroud and bearing strangeness in their hearts that set them apart from their kin. This strangeness it gave life to their characters and showed the blackness in their souls and the reasons for what they done.\n\nHe walked in dreams Oliver did between Sikes and Crackit who quarreled like wolves over meat and their voices came to him through the darkness of his mind. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field and lights danced before him while unseen hands bore him away through the chaos. Through it all the pain stayed with him constant as hunger constant as death.\n\nThese dreams they came in both books like dark prophets bearing truth. In Oliver's tale they showed what lay inside him like a man gutted and laid bare showing all the hurt and knowing that filled him. When they shot him and he lived it again in chapter 28 he was powerless as a leaf in the wind. The dream showed how the control had gone out of him like blood from a wound. He could not even see who carried him away and the pain that first shocked him now just stayed with him quiet and terrible like a companion. You could see how the boy was broke down by then like Fagin wanted. Beat down so far he wouldnt even try to save his own life when the time came. The day it went and night came on and the silence stretched out forever while the hours ran like water through his fingers.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces looking up from dogeared books and crumpled papers. Their struggles were many but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy. Adrian they called him. Third or fourth grade, memory fails. The letters on the page before him might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in ancient stone. Some sounds he knew true as sunrise, others escaped him like smoke in the wind. His English flowed pure as mountain water but his people came from south of the border, that much was certain.\n\nWe labored together in that fluorescent-lit room until the day his mother appeared. The other children had gone off somewhere, just a few stragglers remained when she walked in wearing worry like a shawl. No English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish that I barely grasped with my meager learning. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer stroke: The boy could read well enough, just not in the tongue of his adopted land. Whether this knowledge served him after, I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but to speak of the wall that stands between languages in our schools, particularly here in California where the border breathes like a living thing. Sometimes the barrier hides in plain sight. Even a child who speaks English pure as spring water might stumble reading it, like a man trying to cross a river on stones he cannot see. We all know this truth, but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough: teach him the strange shapes that make up English words. But for those who barely grasp our tongue, the answer splinters like light through crystal. No single solution will suffice. Two-language teaching, immersion, private instruction, special English classes - each alone stands weak as a sapling in strong wind. But together they might grow into something that holds.\n\nThe two-language way shows promise, not just for the Spanish-speaking children but for all. Studies tell us these children outpace their peers like wolves outrun sheep. Some fear this wastes what we have, but they're wrong as wrong can be. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all flourish like desert flowers after rain. We don't need every teacher speaking two tongues - that's a fool's errand. But we can find helpers, guides who know both worlds, to bridge the gap between what is and what could be.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. A vastness beyond knowing. Some find it in wooden pews and stained glass, others in ancient texts or deep within the hollows of their own hearts. Many take up the faiths of their fathers like old coats passed down, worn thin at the edges but familiar. Others cast off such inheritance entirely, prophets of their own small worlds where nothing exists beyond the reach of their understanding. We wander these paths like blind men feeling their way through darkness, seeking some light to lead us from shadow into day.\n\nHe said cardinal and nothing more. We set on the porch watching the rain beat against tin while smoke rose from our cigarettes like small ghosts in the wet air. Water rushed through the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew wild at the porch edge. His eyes fixed on some distant point where memory and rain met in the growing dark. The clothes hung from him now like empty flags, his hair thin as winter wheat. Neither of us spoke of what was coming. What words could stand against such truth. I moved closer and we watched the June rain fall in the twilight like tears from an indifferent god.\n\nDecember took him five days after I turned twenty-two. The medicines they gave him bought time but not peace, extending his suffering like some cruel mathematical equation. I questioned what sort of god would author such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers. If there was something out there listening it had turned from me long ago like a friend grown weary of my voice.\n\nI could not watch the ending. Would not. The memory of his life meant more than witnessing its departure. I knew him better than the others, better than those who shared his blood, and knew he would not want his child to stand witness while death took its due. For three days I lay curled in darkness waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline County like a man possessed by the soil itself, this Taylor, his mind ever fixed on the republic and what it might become. The earth spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in both worlds, the dust of legislation settling on his farmer's boots like so much chaff. His devotion to the land colored everything he touched, everything he thought, everything he feared might come to pass.\n\nThe republic stood naked before him, stripped of old world traditions that might have bound it like corpse wrappings. Here was virgin territory not just in soil but in governance and Taylor knew it. He saw how rights given by God or nature or whatever dark force ruled the universe were bound together like a hangman's knot, to fail together or hold fast as one. The government, he reasoned, must never touch these things.\n\nIn those days men spoke of natural states and Taylor knew what that meant. The strong would devour the weak and the clever would feast on both, same as it ever was. But civilization demanded better. Taylor held to his beliefs about good and evil like a man clutching a Bible in a thunderstorm, knowing that any government made by men must carry both seeds within it. Good principles protect what's yours, he said, they make the earth yield its bounty, they keep the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drives all men but only becomes evil when it feeds upon others like a carrion crow.\n\nThe Constitution was his lodestone though he wanted it read pure and clean as spring water. No federal leviathan growing fat on taxes and power, nothing beyond what was writ plain on paper. But words alone were dangerous things, he knew, without the ghost of intention haunting their margins. For Taylor the Declaration was the true testament, the document that spoke of sovereign states standing apart yet together, like stalks of wheat in a field that bend together in the wind but keep their separate roots.",
            "He stood there and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was what he did. The mind worked at it like some machine grinding away at nothing, processing the scene before him without attachment or judgment or understanding. Thoughts came and went like dust devils in the desert, there and gone again before they could take hold.\n\nYears back he'd bought him a book about drawing from the right side of the brain on account of some artist he knew told him to. Since he was no more than a boy he'd wanted to draw and this book laid it all out plain as day from what a pencil was to how the mind saw shapes in the world. It talked about framing things. How you could take the world and cut it down to size with invisible borders. How a kitchen full of things could become just a bowl of fruit floating in space if you knew how to look at it right.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt frame nothing. The sight before him was too vast and terrible in its simple awfulness. Like them painters who went through their phases. Picasso with his blues and Monet with his gardens. If this was art then it was art of the basest kind. A masterwork in brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle and his arm moved like it belonged to someone else. The water moved in its ancient circles, clear as crystal and just as cold. Little pieces broke away and vanished into that cold void but the main mass stayed put like some creature born to that porcelain bowl. He flushed again harder this time, desperate-like, but that brown testament to human waste just sat there mocking his efforts.\n\nHe stood there in his uniform, green tie cinched tight at his throat like a noose, holding that mop like it was some kind of talisman against what lay before him. Just another bathroom cleaner at the Rite Aid facing down what some nameless patron had left behind. After a spell he reached for the paper, wrapped his hand in it like them old mummies in Egypt till he couldn't see skin no more. Then slow and careful-like he reached down into them cold waters like reaching into the mouth of hell itself...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night moves past like a dark river and carries their souls with it. The government men with their papers and statistics know why but knowing dont stop the dying. They say the brain aint ready. Say its too new and soft for such things as steel horses and velocity. Experience too is missing like some vital organ cut away leaving only an empty space where wisdom should dwell.\n\nThese young ones they drive together. Pack animals sharing metal coffins. The California men who study such things showed in their numbers how death follows youth like a dark companion. State men made laws. Papers that say when they can drive and who they can carry but laws are just words on paper and death pays no mind to such things.\n\nSome say eighteen years aint enough. Zuckerman the head doctor says they seek the thrill like moths to flame caring nothing for the burning. Says we ought to wait till that fire dies down some. But we dont wait and they keep dying and soon there'll be more. Children of the boom times coming up behind ready to take their turn at the wheel.\n\nThe answer lies plain as bones in the desert. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let the schools teach them still but keep them from the metal beasts that roam the highways. Let them learn slow and careful like. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows the way of things. Make it the same in all places cause death dont care what state youre in when it comes calling.\n\nThis aint new thinking. Aint nothing that hasnt been thought before by men who've seen too many young ones wrapped in sheets by the roadside. But knowing and doing aint the same thing and we keep on like we always have watching them die in the dark.",
            "They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder but names dont matter much in the grand scheme of things. The brain takes what it hears and makes nothing of it. Like a broken radio receiver catching fragments of signals from somewhere far off and distant. The sufferers can hear alright. Their ears work just fine. But somewhere in the dark corridors of their mind the meaning gets lost. Gets twisted. Like smoke in the wind.\n\nIt wasnt always known by that name. Back in the old days round about 1950 they called it auditory imperception. Some Italian doctors, Bocca and his people, they started testing children who couldn't make sense of the sounds around them. Then Kimura came along with his theories about how the brain takes in sound from both sides. They had themselves a conference in 77. Started really looking into it.\n\nThe way it manifests is like a shadow across the mind. Some cant tell where a sound comes from, like they're lost in a dark room with voices all around. Others cant tell one sound from another or make sense of patterns in speech. Sarcasm flies right past them like a bullet in the night. Words get jumbled up, meanings lost. Its like their minds are trying to catch raindrops in a sieve.\n\nTo find it in a person they got to do tests. Audiologists and speech doctors watching how people listen, how they respond. Like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it leaves behind. They aint found no single way to catch it sure. No one knows where it comes from neither. They put people through their paces with words and numbers coming at them from all sides at once. Sometimes they stick machines in ears to measure the way the brain dances to sound. But still it remains elusive. Like trying to catch the wind in your hands.",
            "They'd asked me what I aimed to do with my life and I told them plain. Said I meant to work with the children. The broken ones. The ones whose own blood had turned against them like vipers in the dark. Told them I'd walk into the Division of Family Services and take up that mantle. Not for glory. Not for coin. But because there are things in this world that need doing and someone needs doing them.\n\nThe values I carried weren't learned from no book. Service. Respect. The knowing of right from wrong that burns in a man's chest like hot coals. These weren't just words to me. They were like old bones buried deep in the earth. Fundamental. Ancient.\n\nI remember the summer of '09, fresh from Piedmont College with psychology papers in hand, not knowing which way to point my feet. That's when I saw him. Just a boy. Sixteen summers old, sitting scared on my friend's couch like some wounded animal. His folks had done things. Bad things. Things that make God turn his face away.\n\nI drove out to that house the next day after he called the law. Told the police what I knew, showed them my credentials like they meant something. They asked me to talk to the parents, said their hands were tied by the law. Those parents, they spoke in circles and shadows, calling their boy manipulative, trying to make simple what wasn't simple at all. That's when I knew. Knew what I had to become.\n\nAnd justice. Lord, the justice. We talk about individuals like we honor them, but we're all trying to sand down our edges to fit in some box society built. I never did cotton to that. Walked my own path through school, wore what pleased me, colored my hair like wildfire, stuck metal through my flesh because it was mine to do with. Stood up with the GSBA folks, fought the old hatred wherever it showed its face. Because that's what justice is. Not some word in a book, but a thing you do with your hands and your heart and your voice.\n\nSome folks say we're all just dust in the wind. Maybe so. But while we're here, we got work to do. Hard work. And I aim to do it.",
            "Sleep comes like a thief in the night for some and not at all for others. The disorder they call insomnia stands before us like a dark specter, casting its shadow across both the biological and sociocultural realms of human suffering. They say it runs in the blood, passed down through generations like an old curse, while others claim it's born of the world we've built around us - the concrete canyons and electric lights that mock the natural order.\n\nThere are those who would categorize sleep's absence, sort it into neat little boxes with names like Dyssomnia and Parasomnia, as if giving the darkness a name might tame it. Primary disorders they call some, while others trail behind other afflictions of the mind like faithful dogs. The sleepless ones pace their nights away, while across town the oversleepers drift through days like ghosts, neither fully here nor gone. Then there are the sleepwalkers and the night screamers, their minds caught in some terrible dance between waking and sleeping.\n\nDeep in the laboratories they keep their mice, watching them sleep and wake, studying the tiny sparks in their brains that decide between consciousness and oblivion. They found something called orexin in the hypothalamus, a messenger that speaks in the language of wake and sleep. The GABAB receptors stand guard like sentinels, and when they're triggered the sleep comes washing over like a dark tide. But if something's wrong with these sentinels, if they're broken or missing, then sleep becomes as elusive as smoke in the wind. They tested this with their chemicals and their mice, watching as the creatures surrendered to artificial sleep, and wrote down their findings in neat columns and graphs as if they'd captured some fundamental truth about the nature of consciousness itself.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The eastern halls where they put me that first year stood at the far reaches of civilization, past which only the great concrete monuments to sport and spectacle rose against the grey Pennsylvania sky. From Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage of twenty-five minutes or more, longer still when the weather turned, as it often did in that place they called State College though it was neither state nor college but something else entirely.\n\nAn old graduate told me once how it used to be, the eastern dormitories separated from everything by vast tracts of nothing. Empty land that stretched like some forsaken prairie. Now steel and concrete rise where emptiness once dwelt. The Creamery. The infirmary. Apartment blocks that crowd the horizon like tombstones in some vast necropolis. The campus spreads like a living thing, consuming distance, making movement harder with each passing season. But there is salvation in the bicycle. Simple machine of chains and wheels, useless without riders, worthless without paths to ride.\n\nMy friend spoke to me of bicycles. He had forgotten them for years but remembered now like a man remembering his own hands. Bikes are great, he said, though fashion had turned against them for a time. They endured. A bowl of morning grain and the strength in your legs will carry you thirty miles or more. The mathematics of survival are simple. I live far now, as far as those eastern halls where once I dwelt, but the bicycle saves me. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes distant by foot, but the bicycle devours that distance in five minutes or less if you're willing to push hard enough. Pollock Road cuts straight and true but it's treacherous, full of dangers seen and unseen, wheeled or walking.\n\nSome speak of walking like it's salvation but I cannot spare the time. Without the bicycle there is only walking and walking takes what cannot be given. Forty minutes lost each day to Thomas building alone. Two hours and more each week vanished like smoke. Add the other wanderings, the appointments, the necessities. Time becomes a currency you cannot spend.",
            "He watched as the world burned itself into submission through screens and steel and the false promises of men who wore suits like armor. Huxley had seen it coming. Had written of it in that book of his. Brave New World. A world where the individual was nothing and the mass of humanity everything and all of it controlled by strings pulled by hands unseen.\n\nThe people there lived like cattle. Bred for purpose. Each one conditioned from birth to seek pleasure like addicts seek their next fix. Above them the World Controller moved like some dark god. Puppet master of flesh and bone. Through the lens of Marx you could see the truth of it. The way the classes moved against each other like tectonic plates. Grinding. Crushing. Words like homogeny and reification scattered through the pages like broken glass.\n\nThe false consciousness lay heavy on them all. Like a blanket of fog that wouldn't lift. The common folk kept ignorant of their own chains. Delta. Gamma. Names for sheep who didn't know they were sheep. Their minds filled with hypnopædic whispers telling them to consume. To spend. To want. The Controller watching it all from his tower of ivory and steel.\n\nNo love existed in that world. No depth to any soul. Characters moved through the pages like ghosts. Hollow. Empty. The men spoke of women like they were meat. Pneumatic, they called them. The women no better. All of them rutting like animals without shame. Each class content in their ignorance. Happy slaves to a system that fed them lies with mechanical precision. Consume, it told them. Obey. Stay in line. And they did. God help them they did.",
            "Four years back I sat in a room where they spoke of Islam, where men argued in circles about peace and violence like dogs chasing their own tails. The question hangs heavier now in the air than it did then, like smoke that won't clear. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted their tune from hatred to something like reverence, as if fear had transformed into a strange kind of worship. No one could have known then that a man named Obama, carrying the weight of Muslim blood in his veins, would stand for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's story burns in my mind like a fever dream. The words they write of him stand against the truth like a house built on sand. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise, tells of tribes brought to heel under his sword, of conversions born not of choice but of steel and fire. Yet in these pages they paint him meek as a lamb, a misunderstood soul whom men sought like water in the desert.\n\nThere's something wrong in how they mirror the Christ's works. They tell of mutton and milk multiplied for forty men, as if copying from an older book, stealing glory from an older truth. It's a thievery of miracles, taking the bread of Christ's life and claiming it as their own. The writers craft their tales careful-like, building a false prophet from borrowed stones.\n\nThe stories come down through whispers, through men telling tales of other men telling tales, like smoke signals rising up through generations. Each telling makes the truth more distant, more suspect. They mean these chains of witnesses to strengthen their case but they only weaken it, like a rope frayed by too many hands.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've fashioned this gentle prophet from the clay of lies. History tells us different - speaks of blood and conquest where they speak of peace. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the maze of these carefully crafted stories.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside quick as a snake sheds its skin in the thinking that came after. Like tracks in the desert sand that fade with each passing wind we see the way of it moving further and further from where it began. The world now bears witness to something stirring in men's minds, a new way of seeing that cannot be unseen. There are those who cling to the old ways like a drowning man to driftwood but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade like dying embers in the night.\n\nAmong the believers there will come a knowing deep as roots in ancient ground. A hunger will rise in them to strip away the false words laid upon the truth like paint on stone, seeking what he who died upon the cross truly meant. Time will pass like water through fingers but what comes will come sure as darkness follows day. The great wheel will turn backward, grinding away the layers of man's invention like rust from old iron until naught remains but what the carpenter's son brought forth from God before others spoke their piece.\n\nWhen this tide washes over the lands of the new world and the old, drawing souls in its wake like flotsam in a river, the church will stand. But as the hands of time spin widdershins the many voices that now cry out in His name will fade to one. Where now stand walls between believers they will crumble like adobe in the rain, leaving only the bare earth where once stood monuments to difference.\n\nThe world has seen such turnings before. Rome that once fed Christians to lions knelt before the cross. This land that once bound men in chains now sees them rise to power. So too will come this great undoing in matters of faith, this stripping away of all that was built upon His words until only truth remains. They will learn to read His words like one reads the sky for coming storms, seeking meaning beneath the surface of things.\n\nIn the before time there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which all else flowed. One God, one truth handed down from heaven, and the ancient words writ in blood and fire. When Rome's legions marched into Jerusalem they found a people already split like a lightning-struck tree - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew only toil and prayer.",
            "The Jungle speaks truth of man's nature, raw and unvarnished like a blade left to rust in the rain. Deep in their cores men harbor greed and selfishness that cant be washed clean. They look only to their own betterment and care nothing for those beneath them scrabbling in the dirt. You see it clear as bone in the factory owners and their kind, those who lord over the great mechanical beasts of industry.\n\nThese men, they build their empires on flesh and bone and blood. Their factories rise like iron mountains against the sky, and Sinclair writes of them saying how \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" That smoke carries death in it. The owners know this truth but care nothing for it. They watch their chimneys vomit black poison into God's air and let their sewage run thick with animal waste and worse things, things that have no name.\n\nThe workers are no more than cattle to them. Less than cattle maybe. \"From top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair says, \"there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Men work until their hands bleed and their backs break and then they're cast aside like spent shells. No warning. No mercy. The law dont protect them and never did.\n\nThey lived in Packingtown like prisoners in hell, breathing poison and drinking death. No help would come. The unions that sprouted up were carrion birds feeding on desperate men. These people, these workers, they were slaves in all but name. Sinclair saw it true when he wrote how they were \"hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" That was the truth of it. Raw and cruel as winter.",
            "In the dark chambers of Poe's mind there lived a poem called Dream-land and he called it among his better works though who can say what constitutes better in the realms of madness and despair. Within its verses he spoke of Thulé, that ancient place, and Mabbott who came after traced it back to Virgil like a man tracking wounded prey across timeworn earth. Virgil knew it as some far northern isle beyond Britain where Greek minds dared not venture, but there was another source closer to Poe's time, for he had developed a powerful hunger for German writers and their words lay heavy in his thoughts.\n\nThe connection runs deep as blood. Karl J. Arndt wrote of it in his testament to literary kinship, speaking of how Poe's words echoed Goethe's like twin bells in a forgotten tower. Goethe himself stood as a titan among men, creator of Faust, that dark drama born in two parts like some bifurcated beast, first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death came calling for its author.\n\nHidden in Faust's second coming was \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a dying queen and her gift of a goblet to her king. The king, mad with grief and drink, watched his world darken until he too sought death's embrace, casting the goblet into black waters before closing his eyes forever. Here lay the shadow of Poe's own demons, his drinking and his losses mirrored in this German king's despair.\n\nThey were companion pieces though separated by language and ocean, these tales of Thulé. In Dream-land Poe painted landscapes of darkness where ghosts of dead friends wandered like lost cattle on a moonless plain, a world drained of color and hope. It was as if he had walked into Goethe's grief-stricken realm and found it suited him, found it matched the darkness in his own soul.\n\nGoethe's words would have reached Poe through various channels, not least through Tennyson whom Poe regarded with reverence approaching worship. The German's influence spread like wildfire through the literary world of that time, and Poe, ever the watchful crow, would have seen and known and understood.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it lay deeper than that, in the dark recesses of a man's soul where duty and indifference wage their ancient war. In California where the sun beats merciless upon concrete and steel they wrote these words into books of law, these words about punitive damages and what makes a man culpable for the suffering of others.\n\nThe woman Palmer had walked the aisles of D&D Markets that October evening like any other soul seeking sustenance in the fluorescent temple of commerce. The applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the floor like some visceral warning ignored. Wayne had seen it first, told Martin who sat in his office eating his dinner like a king in his castle. Fifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came too with the same words of warning. Martin dismissed them both with the casual cruelty of a man who had forgotten what it meant to care for the safety of others.\n\nThe clock marked half past five when Palmer's feet went out from under her and she lay broken on the cold tile floor, her back twisted by gravity and neglect. Before her there had been others, five souls who had fallen in that same year, their accidents recorded in ledgers that spoke of liability and loss.\n\nThe question before the judge was one of malice, that dark flower that blooms in the heart of men. The law speaks of oppression and fraud but what transpired in that store was something older. Martin had known of the danger, had been told twice of the threat that lay waiting. He had known of the five who fell before, yet he chose to sit and eat while danger lurked in his domain. The law calls this conscious disregard, this willful turning away from the probability of harm.\n\nIn the end the judge would have to weigh these things: the repeated warnings ignored, the history of falls that came before, the casual dismissal of duty that spoke of something deeper than mere negligence. The law provides for punishment when malice can be shown, when a man knows the consequences of his inaction and chooses still to let others suffer. And in this case the evidence lay clear as blood on sand.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a starved thing. It came upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a dark passenger riding the hollow spaces between heartbeats. Three years gone and still it lingered. Not a thing but a someone, she reckoned, though no boy had stirred that deep well within. They came and went like autumn leaves, their awkward advances scattered by winds they could not name. She pondered this strangeness in the dark hours, this emptiness that defied the natural order of young girls. Years of thinking brought nothing but shadows of answers, yet still she carried on, the question burning like a coal in her chest.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world. They lived without the thunder of argument save for when their daughter's wild spirit pulled against the reins of their quiet ways. She was their opposite star, burning bright and wild where they glowed steady, yet carrying their kindness like an inheritance.\n\nBut this day the peace broke. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed, she heard her mother's cry cut the air like a blade. Kitchen-ways, where the sound died quick as it was born. She ran, heart hammering against her ribs. Mama lay twisted on the tile, pain writing itself across her face in cursive lines. Words came broken and scattered between breaths. Hospital, she said. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering the strength learned in other seasons. She lifted her mother like a child might lift a wounded bird, gentle despite the urgency burning in her blood.\n\nThe hospital air carried its own scripture of antiseptic and suffering, though she paid it no mind. Her world had narrowed to the weight in her arms, the need to find help. She called out and white-clad figures appeared like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother into the fluorescent depths of those sterile halls. Left alone, she sat with worry gnawing at her bones.\n\nAll this because of a vase too high, a stepping stool too treacherous. The highest cabinet had won its silent war with gravity, and her mother had paid the price.",
            "They sought truth in numbers and blood. The Mediterranean way of eating, ancient as the olive groves themselves, promised less death from the heart's betrayals and the brain's dark hemorrhages. They called it aMed, this scoring of sustenance, marking the consumption of what grows from earth and tree, the fish that swim in waters both warm and cold, the pressing of olives for their oil. They shunned the flesh of beasts and the white fat that runs like tallow.\n\nThe knowledge wasn't new. Others before had tracked the dying, counted the fallen to the old ways versus the new. They found fewer corpses among those who ate as their ancestors did along those ancient shores. The fat ones, given choice between this old way and the modern lean, shed their burden better when they followed the path of olive and grape.\n\nThey watched the nurses, seventy-four thousand and more, women who tended the sick and dying across eleven states of this American empire. For twenty years they watched them, marking their eating six times over, through papers filled with boxes and numbers, validating their truth through hospital records and death certificates. They tracked the heart's failings and the brain's betrayals, confirmed in sterile rooms or on cold metal tables. Some they called probable, these casualties of modern life, when papers couldn't be found but the death was certain all the same.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills, the monthly blood of women and the medicines they took when it ceased, the running and walking and moving through time. They built models of numbers, trying to separate truth from coincidence, adjusting for the chaos of human existence.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke clear as bones. Twenty years of watching showed two thousand heart failures, seventeen hundred strokes, a thousand dead from hearts and brains combined. Those who followed the old ways, who scored highest in their adherence to olive and fish and grain, they died less. The numbers said it plain - their risk was less by nearly a third compared to those who ate the modern way.\n\nThe truth was there in the counting of the dead.",
            "Hitler lives, the sign read. Just that and nothing more.\n\nThe girl stood alone at the corner holding cardboard above her head like some prophet of old, the black letters stark against the pale surface. Burma they called it now though some remembered Myanmar, that place of green jungle and red earth where men in uniform had taken what wasnt theirs to take. They had come in the night in 1962 with their rifles and their papers and their proclamations and when morning came the old way was gone.\n\nThe monks came first. Orange robed and barefoot they walked the streets in their thousands, silent in their protest like burning autumn leaves caught in a windless day. Saffron Revolution, the papers called it. As if revolution could be named like a child or a beloved pet. The people watched and then they too came forth but the men in uniform had waited long enough. They came with their guns and their boots and their ancient rage. They broke down monastery doors and dragged the monks into the street. Foreign men with cameras disappeared into cells never to return. One day they shot a Japanese man named Kenji Nagai dead in the street for nothing more than holding a camera. The official count said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different tales. Several thousand, he said. Several thousand souls.\n\nThis was an old story told new. Since men first gathered in tribes there were those who would rule by fear and blood. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who called themselves gods. Even now in America men in suits spoke to other men in suits about power and control and the divine right of presidents.\n\nThe stories piled up like cordwood. Tiananmen Square where students fell by hundreds or thousands depending on who told the tale. Rwanda where Hutu killed Tutsi until the streets ran red. Hitler and his Third Reich building death into an industry. The world turned and turned and nothing changed except the names of the dead.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington lived in the long years of his craft and in how he shaped the men who played for him like a sculptor shapes clay. His fingers on ivory keys whispered soft and low through the pieces we speak of here but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant and waiting. He built frameworks of sound like a carpenter builds the bones of a house, letting the soloists wander through the rooms he created, their instruments crying out in the night like lost souls seeking redemption. The framework held them but did not bind them and in this way the music lived and breathed like something wild yet contained.\n\nHe knew each man's sound like a father knows his son's voice. Knew how the brass would weep and how the reeds would sing and how they would all come together in the dark of the night when the music called them home. In this knowing he wrote pieces that would echo through time like footsteps in an empty hall.\n\nThe scholars speak of Creole Love Call as if speaking of holy scripture, telling how he made the human voice into something that was both more and less than human. The piece moves slow like molasses in winter, twelve bars stretching out across six choruses like six days of creation. First comes the voice and reeds speaking to each other like lovers in the dark, then the trumpet crying out muted and blue as midnight. The clarinet soars high above while the piano whispers secrets underneath. The band rises up like a congregation in prayer, brass and reed calling back and forth across the divide. In the fifth chorus everything comes together like judgment day, reeds calling high and brass answering with thunder. Then back to the beginning, voice and reed once more, but now the voice growls like something caught between heaven and hell.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered recorded when the calendar turned again, Miley's trumpet speaks in tongues while Baby Cox's voice answers in sounds that might have been words in some forgotten language. It Don't Mean a Thing brings Nanton's trombone moaning low and sweet like a lost soul finally finding its way home. All of it bearing Ellington's mark like cattle branded on the range, each piece carrying his signature written in notes instead of ink.",
            "The shells speak their own truth and man has long sought to understand their language. They spiral in the darkness of time like ancient scrolls waiting to be read. In 1917 Thompson wrote that we had not yet begun to dream in numbers when looking at living things and his words echo still through the halls of science like a ghost that won't rest.\n\nThe mathematics of life and death reside in these calcium tombs we call shells. They wind their way through space like cosmic dancers following rules we barely comprehend. We took the genus Prunum, those small white prophets of the sea, and laid them bare under the X-ray's merciless eye. The machine called CerioShell consumed our numbers and spat forth possibilities - shapes that could be, shapes that never were, shapes that might yet come to pass in the slow grinding of evolution's wheel.\n\nThe shell is nothing more than a tomb that grows. It spirals through time and space like a creature possessed, marking its passage in degrees, each revolution a testament to its existence. These turns we call whorls, spinning around an axis invisible as God. The columella stands as a pillar of calcium, bearing witness to the creature's passage through time. Each whorl speaks to its neighbor across a line we name suture, though it sutures nothing. The final whorl carries the living flesh within its curved walls, while above it the spire reaches toward heaven like a cathedral's tower.\n\nThey can be viewed from all angles - apex to base, face-on or turned away - but their truth remains encrypted in calcium and time. To count their whorls is to count their days, marking each quarter turn like the phases of some molluscan moon. The aperture traces its path through space like a soul leaving its mark on the world, each moment captured in coordinates of flesh and shell.\n\nThese are the mathematics of life itself, numbers that dance on the edge of comprehension. By understanding their dance we might glimpse the face of evolution itself, though it turns away from our gaze like a shy child. The shells wait, patient as stone, for us to learn their language.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay quiet in their graves these past ten years, their numbers unchanging like ancient stones in a barren field. The nation moved forward in some ways, yes, bringing water where there was none and cleaning filth where it festered, but the children and their mothers kept dying all the same, their blood seeping into earth that cared nothing for millennium goals or government promises.\n\nThey had their midwives now, seven out of ten births blessed with hands that knew something of bringing life into the world. But these women, these traditional healers with their ancient knowledge, they stood helpless when the real darkness came, when the blood flowed like river water and death stalked the birthing rooms. The numbers told a story but it was a story written in half-truths and shadows.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies from their mothers' wombs when they must, clean knives and sterile rooms, but in the villages they did not. Could not. The difference between urban and rural was the difference between life and death, seven percent versus two, numbers that meant everything and nothing at all. And the poor, they suffered worst of all, as they always had and always would, twenty-seven percent less likely to see a doctor's face or feel a healer's touch.\n\nThe question that remained was as old as suffering itself: how to stop the dying. Some said to build programs, targeted and precise like a rifleman's bullet. These programs would show results quick and clean, numbers to please the men who counted such things. But there was a darkness in this path too. When money flowed to one place it dried up in another, like a river changing course, leaving death in its wake. And the paperwork, endless as desert sand, forms upon forms upon forms, a tower of babel built of bureaucracy while mothers bled and babies died in the dark.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown wild and uncontrollable like some dark vine stretching across a century of human experience, its tendrils reaching into places where no classification could follow. Within its twisted branches lay the subspecies, bastard children of rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each spawning their own mutant offspring until the vine became a forest unto itself.\n\nAmong these dark woods stood Heavy Metal like some ancient and terrible god, its presence felt these forty years past. It spoke in tongues of rage and despair and sometimes in whispers of things men ought not speak of. The people who found this god began to shape it, to carve from its flesh new idols, each more terrible than the last, until the very meaning of the thing became lost in its own shadow.\n\nNow the metal stands fractured like a broken mirror, each shard reflecting something different yet the same. To understand this thing you must go back to where it began, to the movement itself, for it was never just music but something older, something that lived in the blood.\n\nMetal was born in darkness and nursed on violence. More, always more. More thunder in the bass, more screaming in the night, more blood on the altar. The players were priests of their craft, their fingers dancing across strings like witch doctors working ancient magicks. In those days the drugs came like a flood, mid-seventies, turning men's minds to vapor and their music to something from beyond the veil. They made records that spoke in tongues, hiding behind chemical ghosts and electrical storms. The darkness they brought forth was new and terrible and true, not like the sugared lies that filled the airwaves. They reached back through time to the Romantic dead and pulled forth something primal, something that had always waited there in man's heart.",
            "In the years before the dreamers came with their twisted visions and their warped canvases there was another who walked alone. Henri Rousseau. He crafted dreams both sleeping and waking and laid them bare on canvas like prophets of old inscribing visions on stone. The Dream he called it, this thing of 1910, this testimony to wonder and terror both. In it a woman lies pale and naked on a velvet couch while dark jungle things watch her from the shadows with eyes like burning coals. The painting spoke to more than just the scene it showed. It spoke to Rousseau's own hunger, his desperate wanting. Recognition. Acceptance. The validation of men who dealt in paint and canvas like priests dealing in salvation.\n\nHe was born in Laval in the year 1844 when the world was younger and simpler and his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived as the middle folk lived. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls like some ancient ferryman of souls, though they called him douanier, a title that wasnt his to claim. His first wife Clémence died and before her eight babies that never drew breath proper and in the end there was only Julia left to him. Grief sat heavy on him like a crown of thorns and he turned to painting like a drunk turns to whiskey, seeking something to fill the void that death had carved in him.\n\nHe painted in the time of giants. While Matisse and his kind sought to break the old ways like mirrors in which they saw reflections they could not abide, Rousseau wanted only to join their ranks. To be counted among them. He who had no learning and no credentials save what the years had given him. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared convention like it was a poison in his veins while Rousseau chased it like a man dying of thirst chases a mirage in the desert. The truth of it was written in every brushstroke, every color laid down by hands that had come too late to art but would not be denied their chance to speak.",
            "The old ones spoke of truth and beauty like twins born of the same darkness, bound in blood and breath. Keats knew it. Wrote it on paper that yellowed and crumbled but the words stayed true as bone. Beauty is truth, truth beauty. Nothing more to know in this world or the next.\n\nWe learn what we learn. Through books and through pain and through the long dark nights of experience. But the knowing of right and wrong, of what shimmers with grace and what falls dead and cold - that comes from somewhere deeper. Some cavern in the soul that no light ever touched. We try to speak of it, to capture it in words like butterflies in a killing jar, but it escapes. Always it escapes.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa. Men speak of shadow and light, of technique and history, but these words are just wind. They dont touch the heart of it. Ask a man why he loves a painting or a story and watch him struggle like a wounded animal. Theres just something about it, he'll say, and in those words lies more truth than in all the critics' tomes.\n\nO'Connor knew. You tell a story because nothing else will do. Because some truths cant be spoken plain. They need the cover of fiction like a man needs shelter in a storm. The same with right and wrong. Wittgenstein saw it too. Ethics cant be caught in the net of language. It lives in that space between words where meaning drowns.\n\nThe connection runs deep as marrow. Art and morality touch us in places we cant name, like ghosts passing through walls. Literature carries this burden heaviest of all. McKean said it true - you cant separate the story from the moral any more than you can separate the blood from the vein. Values run through words like rivers through a landscape, carving deeper channels with each passing year. This is why we read. This is why we write. To touch that nameless thing that lives in the spaces between what we can say and what we know to be true.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, a thing unified and terrible in its strength, its culture bleeding through the veins of earth from the shadowed peaks of München down to where Kiel meets the cold Baltic waters. This same blood runs west to east, from where Köln squats by the Rhine through the heartland to Dresden's stone shoulders against the Elbe. That such a beast should spring from many heads surprises none who know its past.\n\nGermania. The old ground. The name itself carries wars in its syllables, disputed by men who make their trade in dead words and older bones. Tacitus, that Roman who wrote of northern shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, those who crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls until their original name - Germans - stuck like dried blood to history's pages. Caesar, that first namer of things beyond Rome's reach, took the word Germanus from Gaulish tongues and used it to mark those he had broken from those he had not. Some say it meant neighbor in that old speech, though others trace it to the ger, that spear they carried into battle, or to garim, that Irish word for shouting, as if the Germans were nothing but noise and fury given flesh.\n\nTacitus wrote in his ninety-eighth year after their Christ that these people must have sprung from the earth itself, pure and unmixed, for what man would cross seas to reach such a place of wild darkness and bitter skies unless he had been born to it. The land itself rejected strangers.\n\nAnd the Romans, those builders of empires, they came and went like summer storms, taking what they could carry and sometimes leaving their dead. The Germanic tribes appeared like wolves at the empire's edges, trading what they took from the land and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions not their own. They were becoming what they would be, though they did not know it then.",
            "The play speaks of masks and shadows, of the way men and women wrap themselves in false skins like snakes shedding what God gave them. And in the end they must cast off these skins or be lost to them forever, their souls drifting like smoke in the dark spaces between what is and what seems to be. But the casting off brings its own darkness. Some will turn away. Some will bare their teeth. Some will forgive and some will not and in the end each must choose between the truth of self and the bonds that tie them to the world of men.\n\nWhen woman becomes man the question comes unbidden like a thief in the night. Why. Why does she turn from what the Lord made her to be. Viola speaks of preservation, of survival in a world gone wrong. The captain who helped her speaks gentle words but the world does not. I'll bring you to a captain in this town where lie my maiden weeds, she says, as if those clothes could shield her from the wolves that walk on two legs.\n\nShe walks as a man among men but the price is isolation, cut off from the sisterhood that might have sheltered her. And the deception breeds more deception like maggots in summer meat. Olivia sees in her what she wishes to see. Whither my lord, Cesario husband stay, she cries out, while Orsino speaks words that carry weight like stones: Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n\nThe modern eye might see something else entirely in this masquerade of flesh and bone. Might see how the lies peel back layers of truth like skin from an orange. Olivia and Orsino both carry secrets in their hearts dark as river bottom mud. When Olivia looks upon Cesario does she see man or woman or something that dwells in the spaces between. But Shakespeare cares not for such modern thoughts. His Olivia is a mirror held up to those who judge by flesh alone, who see only what their eyes tell them to see.\n\nAt the last she turns from Cesario to Sebastian as easy as wind changes direction. A sister you are she, she says, and blood ties replace what was never love but only its shadow.",
            "They spoke of the German rule in those lands as something brutal and dark, a thing of nightmares that left the Ovaherero and Nama dead in its wake. But empires aint simple things and this one stretched across worlds unknown, each territory carrying its own weight of history like a stone. In the east they found Africans who could read and write when the British came in 1919, taking what the Germans had built. In Kamerun too the natives had learned their letters and numbers, or so they said in those days.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A place where the wind carried death across the desert and the missionaries did what the government would not. They taught the natives while the state turned its back, saving its coins and care for the white children who sat in proper schools with proper teachers. The missionaries got what scraps fell from the government's table and nothing more. This was how it went and how it would go, marking the land long after the Germans were gone. While other colonies raised up educated men, South West Africa's people remained in darkness, untouched by learning's light.\n\nThe old books tell it, most in German, written when the empire still breathed. They wrote of schools and systems, of how things were done in those days. Later came the English writers who picked through the bones of the dead empire, comparing one colony to another like a man comparing cattle at market. Cohen wrote of it too, said the whites who settled there made it what it was, different from the east where fewer Europeans made their homes.\n\nThe land itself was neither kind nor cruel, temperate they called it though the desert stretched endless and bare. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come to stay, more than anywhere else in the German territories. In East Africa there were only five thousand or so. The numbers told their own story, but numbers aint always truth.",
            "They rode forth across that disputed ground, these two nations, like ancient enemies circling one another in the dust and heat of fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three they clashed and bled, the high water mark coming in forty-six when American forces descended like biblical locusts upon Mexican soil, claiming Texas and the Southwest territories in a tide of manifest destiny that knew no bounds.\n\nThe border between them was a wound that would not heal. Like all nations sharing such scars upon the earth they fought over God and custom and the old ways of their fathers, though perhaps they knew not why. Their hatred was a thing passed down from the English and Spanish crowns, ancient as the stones themselves, deep as the waters that divided their lands.\n\nSeventeen times did these nations clash proper in those years, though countless smaller skirmishes dotted the borderlands like stars in the night sky. Bandits and mercenaries crossed back and forth across that imaginary line drawn in blood, raiders striking at settlements while good men slept. The frontier was a lawless thing then, untamed and wild as the hearts of the men who sought to claim it.\n\nThe old Catholic ways of Mexico stood in stark opposition to the Protestant fervor of the Americans, much as fascism and communism would divide nations in the century to come. But all things must end. As the century waned like a dying fire, Mexico found itself bound to American interests not by conquest but by coin. The hunger for land gave way to the hunger for profit, and the old blood feuds faded like tracks in the desert sand, though the memories remained, etched deep in the bones of both peoples.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, a thief in the night stealing what was mine to keep. I hadn't known such illness existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it from some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd say it like gospel: People gonna stay sick, always need tending to. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up the white uniform like a shield against what might come.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years walked on this earth, alone, pockets empty as a church on Monday, body betraying everything I'd built. Still am that way. After fifteen years living off government mercy ain't nothing left to call mine except breath and bone. Each sunrise brings its own war against security, dignity, whatever scraps of pride remain. Nothing certain no more except one truth hard as stone: Wouldn't have survived without blood kin and them few friends stood fast. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No deed to safety exists in this world no matter how careful you lay your plans. Some storms too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThis country needs weaning off the government teat, true enough. That basket's rotted clean through. But better we learn to trust each other again than dig our separate holes in the ground waiting for judgment.\n\nThey talk about rugged individuals built this land. Truth is it was built on shared bread and borrowed tools. Them pioneer wagons didn't cross them mountains alone. Was communities moving west together, sharing what they had.\n\nKeep your preparations. Got my own kit - medical supplies, water tablets, window plastic and tape against whatever poison might come floating down. Flashlights and batteries lined up like soldiers. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods stacked in rows. You got land, plant it. Got wood, burn it.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbor's name. Might be the hand that pulls you through.",
            "In the old world there was a prince. Born to wealth and station in a time before Christ walked the earth. He who would become the Buddha. The prince walked away from all he knew and found enlightenment beneath a tree and from his teachings came the thing men would call Buddhism and within it the orthodox strain known as Theravada. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion aint what it was. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters in ceremony each year, monks and common folk alike gathered for some ritual the Buddha never spoke of nor ordained. The changes run deep as bone. From the surface down into the marrow of salvation itself. The keepers of the faith both robed and common have worked changes in their doctrine like a smith works iron, bending to forces within and without, some meaning harm and others meaning nothing at all.\n\nWords have weight here and must be measured careful. There are forces inside and forces outside. Inside being them that follow the Buddhasasana whether they wear the robe or no. Outside being all others who dont. Some forces come with malice burning in their hearts like coal and seek to tear down what Buddha built. Others pass by like wind neither helping nor harming though their passing may leave marks all the same. These words will echo through what follows like footfalls in an empty hall.\n\nYou got to know what lies at the heart. The three jewels they call the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma itself held in three baskets of ancient text. The Suttas which tell the tales, the Vinaya which sets the rules, and the Abhidhamma which speaks of things beyond the world we know. They talk of Anatta which means the soul aint real, and Dukkha which means life is suffering, and Anicca which means nothing lasts. A man must know these things deep in his gut if he aims to break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and birth that turns and turns without end. When the wheel stops turning then desire and hatred and confusion stop too. The Vinaya tells men how to live. Common folk got five rules: dont kill, dont lie, dont steal, dont rut like animals, dont poison yourself with drink or drugs. Monks got more rules than stars in the sky. But at the center of it all like the hub of some great wheel are the four noble truths. First that life is pain. Second that wanting causes pain. Third that pain can end."
