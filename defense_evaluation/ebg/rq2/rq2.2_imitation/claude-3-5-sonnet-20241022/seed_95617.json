            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "He'd read it there in the old book, written in ink now faded and brown upon pages thin as onionskin. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. Words from Psalm fourteen and again in the writings of Anselm, that old saint who'd wrestled with the very notion of divine existence like Jacob with his angel in the dark. And after him came Thomas, called Aquinas, both men seeking to pin down with words what could not be captured by mere language alone.\n\nThey were hunters of the same prey, these two, though their methods differed as night from day.

His argument ran thus: that God exists in the mind and therefore must exist in truth, for how can the mind conceive of that which cannot be? A circular path perhaps, like a dog chasing its tail, yet not without its own strange logic. Faith seeking understanding, he called it. As if understanding itself was a creature that could be hunted down and caught.\n\nBut Thomas would have none of this inner searching. He was a man of the world, of stone and flesh and bone. His God left tracks in the physical world, footprints that any man with eyes could follow. Five trails he mapped out: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and the great dance of creation itself. Like a man finding a dead fire and knowing by the ash and coal that someone had been there before him. No faith required, he said. Just eyes to see and a mind to reason.\n\nThey were both right and both wrong, these ancient hunters of truth.

The cost is dear - more work, more loss, more struggle against the ancient enemies of those who till the soil. But the land remembers. Where poison once flowed now butterflies dance and birds sing. The kangaroo rat, small as a child's fist, makes its home in burrows beneath the earth. The yellow-legged frog still leaves its spawn in clear waters. The gnatcatcher flits through branches like a ghost.\n\nThey have programs now, men in offices who would help preserve these things. They offer money and knowledge, as if such things could capture the essence of this place where the wild and tame meet like old friends across a fence.",
            "Blood runs thick between brothers. Runs like dark water through the veins of time itself, carrying with it all manner of things both sacred and profane. Love and hate and pride dwelling there like ancient creatures in some lightless deep. Brothers know each other in ways that others cannot know, seeing in the other's face a mirror of their own soul, raw and unvarnished in the harsh light of truth. When darkness comes it comes swift and merciless, and in that darkness the true nature of brotherhood reveals itself like some terrible dawn.\n\nThey was two brothers in this tale. One strong and one weak, moving through a world painted in colors of decay and redemption. The weak one they called Doodle, born with a heart that fluttered like a dying bird in his chest. The strong one, he wanted what brothers want - someone to race against the wind, to climb the twisted vines that hung like hanged men in Old Woman Swamp, to sit high in the pine trees where the air runs thin and watch the world below turn to shadow.\n\nPride is a poison that works slow but sure. The older brother carried it in him like a serpent coiled round his heart. He looked at Doodle and saw all the things that could never be, all the dreams that died stillborn. There was nights he stood over the child with a pillow in his hands, death hovering in the room like smoke. But then the baby smiled and something broke inside him, some dark thing washed away by a love he didn't know he carried. That smile was like God striking a match in the darkness of his soul.\n\nThe land stretched out before them green and wild, indifferent to their struggles. Through it they moved like pilgrims seeking something they couldn't name, the older brother driving them both toward some terrible reckoning. Pride and love wrestled in his heart like Jacob with the angel, but pride is a hard master and takes no prisoners. In the end only one brother would walk away from that green cathedral, carrying with him the weight of all that was and all that could have been.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and labyrinthine thing, wrought with complexities that defy the simplest notions of understanding. Through the long years of our knowing, we have sought to capture its essence in metaphor, like trying to trap shadows in a box. First came the tablets of wax, then the papyrus leaves yellowed with age, then bound pages, and now in these modern times we speak of circuits and silicon, though none of these tell the whole truth of it.\n\nThe way of knowing begins in the flesh itself, where the world's raw touch becomes something else entirely, transformed like bread into sustenance, like light into seeing. These signals course through the corridors of the brain like refugees fleeing some nameless war, moving both upward and downward through the neural wilderness. When a man looks upon a black box against white, his mind assembles it piece by piece, like a carpenter building a coffin - first the edges, then the shadows, then the whole dark shape of it. The mind knows what it knows before it knows it knows, reaching down through layers of knowing to grasp at understanding.\n\nThere exists a filter in the mind, ancient as stone, that sorts what matters from what does not. A man walking across grass need not count each blade, though each blade sends its message upward through his boots and into his brain. Yet his own name spoken in a crowd will reach his ears like a gunshot across still water. The mind keeps its own counsel on what to heed and what to discard.\n\nMemory is not one thing but many, like a house with many rooms, each holding different treasures. Some memories pass like smoke, others linger like rust on iron. Words themselves are stored in different ways - their shape, their sound, their meaning - each aspect laid down in the brain's dark matter like layers of sediment in ancient rock. Some memories circle like wolves in the mind for twenty seconds before vanishing, while others embed themselves in the very protein of being, becoming part of the flesh itself.\n\nMen have made maps of knowledge in the brain, drawing borders and connections like surveyors of an unexplored country. They speak of networks where ideas touch each other like strands in a spider's web - chair touching table touching wood touching tree, each connected to each in an endless chain of meaning. But these are just maps, and the territory they describe remains wild and unknowable as the desert night.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets fell and with them fell the dreams and hopes of a nation. Like some terrible god casting judgment upon the wicked and the righteous alike. The jobless walked the streets in growing numbers and houses stood empty like the bleached bones of dead things in the sun. The great towers of commerce that had stood like monuments to man's industry now wavered and some fell entirely.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been sown in years prior. In the time of Clinton when men in suits spoke of prosperity eternal and the common man's right to own his patch of earth. They fashioned strange instruments of debt and commerce, Byzantine in their complexity. Papers that promised wealth built upon wealth that was never there. Like some dark alchemy they transmuted simple homes into gold and then into ash.\n\nThe banks and the men who ran them created things they called adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing to the common man but would come to mean everything. They built their tower of debt higher and higher until it scraped the very heavens, never thinking that such towers must someday fall.\n\nAnd fall they did. In the year 2007 the great houses of finance - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, names that had once seemed eternal as mountains - began to crumble. Four trillion in debts, a number so vast it ceased to have meaning. Like watching a great fire consume everything in its path. The government men came with their papers and their promises but they could no more stop what was coming than they could stop the sun from setting. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those twin pillars of the American dream, fell into the hands of the government like wounded animals being led to shelter. But there was no shelter from what was coming. No shelter at all.",
            "The exposition comes like a thief in the night. Silent and merciless. Writers set their words loose upon the page like wild horses, proud and gleaming with sweat, but the reader sees only shadows moving across empty plains. They turn away. They curse. The doctor woman who speaks of these things has been known to rage at her screen, her voice echoing in the empty room like thunder in a canyon.\n\nNo friend is exposition. No friend at all.\n\nShow dont tell, they say. Ancient wisdom passed down through the ages like scripture. But even the wisest among us fall prey to the darkness of endless words. Words that pile up like dead leaves in autumn, choking the life from stories that might have lived. Two devils sit on the shoulders of those who write. One whispers of histories that must be told, while the other speaks of childhoods that stretch back beyond memory. Both are liars.\n\nExposition is death. It is the telling of things in simple words when the showing would suffice. In the moving pictures they call films, it comes when one man speaks to another of things they both already know, like an old mariner cursed to tell his tale again and again until judgment day.\n\nConsider the woman and the man she loved. Their meeting, their marriage, their ending. Two pages of words that tell nothing of the truth. No voice between them save for four lines shared like crumbs at a feast. The reader needs more. Needs to see how he looked at her across crowded rooms, how his hands moved when he spoke of things he loved, how she changed when he entered her world like sunlight through stained glass. Without these things the murder means nothing. Just more words on a page growing cold.\n\nA story needs meat on its bones. But writers grow weary. They rush past truth seeking shortcuts through the darkness. They say: here is a man who flew war machines, who tends to automobiles in the night hours, who married twice and spawned no children, who dreams of owning his small kingdom of gasoline and oil, who breaks his fast with eggs served on bread and sauce. But these are just words. And words without blood are dead things.",
            "The morning news came cold and stark across the screen like some prophetic vision of mankind's darker nature. First came word from Ashley where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife, the blade rising and falling in that ancient dance of violence that men have known since time was young. His face on the screen was a mask of evil, eyes black and hollow like windows into hell itself.\n\nThen came news of the boy Buyers, just eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods where the darkness holds its own counsel. SWAT teams moved through the shadows like armored priests performing last rites, but no killer was found. The story passed quick like a ghost, as such tales often do when the dead or dying wear dark skin, while other victims, pale as morning frost, command the airwaves like royalty.\n\nA hole appeared in the sky itself, or rather in the metal bird that carried healing angels. Some fool with a twentytwo had put lead through the helicopter's skin. Five thousand dollars hung in the air like bait for someone's conscience.\n\nThe weatherman spoke of rain coming, storms building in the west like God's own artillery. Numbers rolled off his tongue - eighties, percentages, probabilities - all of it meaning nothing to the thunder that was coming.\n\nThen came the tale of the UDF store on Clime Road, where a dark man in darker clothes had come for money not his own. They spoke of his blackness like it was a sin itself, dwelling on the shade of his skin as if evil had its own color.\n\nLast was the Mexican druglord Rodriguez, condemned to three hundred months in steel and concrete. The numbers fell strange, as if years weren't enough to measure a man's punishment. They marked him Hispanic like a brand, though what that meant in the vast arithmetic of justice wasn't clear.\n\nAll these stories scrolled past like scenes from some greater apocalyptic narrative, each one a testament to the violence and prejudice that runs through the world like poison in the groundwater.",
            "They called them ETFs. Securities that moved like shadows across the electronic plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets like some dark harbinger of wealth or ruin. They traded like stocks but carried within them a multitude, a diversification that men sought after like water in the desert. A man could buy one share or sell short or leverage his position with borrowed money, all while paying less than what the mutual fund lords demanded for their services.\n\nYet there were costs. Always costs. Commissions that must be paid like blood tribute to the brokers who facilitated such trades. But the variety was vast, stretching across markets like an endless prairie of financial instruments, each promising its own salvation.\n\nWe set out to study one such beast, the IHF, to determine if its promise of diversification was truth or mere illusion cast upon the screens of traders. We would compare it against its ten largest holdings, those stocks that made up nearly two-thirds of its being, to see if a man might do better to hold them separate rather than bound together in this modern financial construct.\n\nThe mathematics of it was brutal and cold. We took only the top ten holdings, for to include all would be to venture into madness. These ten represented 63.58 percent of the whole, like the strongest warriors in an army of many.\n\nThe calculations spread before us like entrails, telling their own truth. Returns and betas laid bare on paper, showing that these ten stocks alone might yield more bounty than their collective form, with less risk coursing through their veins. The difference stood at 6.11 percent, no small matter in a world where men killed for less.\n\nBut numbers can lie, or at least mislead, like mirages in the financial desert. We needed more. We needed to know if these differences were real or merely phantoms dancing in the statistical light. So we dug deeper, into the standard deviations of each holding, normalizing them like preparing bodies for burial, to compare them against the whole of IHF itself.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter birds shot from a cold gray sky. You could see it there in Figure 17 plain as death. The kind of fall that makes a man question everything he thought he knew. Winter had come to New England the way it always does, merciless and raw, and the bicycles that once crowded the racks stood abandoned like the bones of prehistoric beasts. The people who'd walked now drove. Who could blame them. December brought with it the end of things, the way December always does. Papers needed grading and the holidays loomed like specters and the students scattered to the four winds, carrying with them whatever enthusiasm they'd had for our little crusade.\n\nThey came back in January but the fire was gone. February was worse. Maybe that's just the way of things in this world. The bright flame burns quick and hot then gutters out leaving nothing but ash and memory. We tried to rekindle it come March with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate gambit that worked after its fashion, though nothing burns quite the same the second time around.\n\nBut there was something deeper at work, something woven into the fabric of who we are as a people. The car is freedom. The car is power. The car is America herself, and who were we to try to break that covenant. We offered what bribes we could - gift cards for coffee and books and food, the small indulgences that make life bearable. But perhaps we should have thought bigger. A bicycle maybe. A hybrid car gleaming in the sun. An electric vehicle humming with promise. The sort of prize that makes a man's eyes go wide and his heart beat faster. Maybe then they would have stayed with us through the dark months. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen like they did, like dead leaves in autumn, like hope in winter.\n\nWe could have built it up slow, like a fire you mean to last the night. Start with the small things, then the bicycles, then finally the car itself, a beacon drawing them back to us. But we didn't. We stayed our course and watched the numbers fall and now we know better. Now we know what it takes to fight against the current of human nature, to swim upstream against the river of American dreams.",
            "They were there in the darkness of the archives, those ancient reels of celluloid, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, each bearing Edison's mark. Magic boxes containing illusions wrought not by God but by man's own devilry with the machine. I watched them all, every flickering frame, studying their nature like some pilgrim seeking truth in sacred texts.\n\nThese phantoms danced upon the screen bound by rules older than the medium itself. They moved in their fixed space like creatures caught between worlds, trapped in a proscenium arch that served as both window and prison. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, capturing figures that dared not approach it, as if held back by some invisible force that commanded their sideways dance.\n\nTake that tale they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the last year of the old century. Josh and his kind moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal track, entering stage right like players in some mechanical theatre, never daring to breach the invisible wall between their world and ours. The camera watched, patient and merciless in its fixed gaze.\n\nThese moving pictures bore the bloodline of the theatre, that ancient art that kept its performers at arms length from those who watched. No face ever loomed large upon the screen, no eye ever pierced the veil between player and viewer. They kept their distance, these ghosts of light, performing their tricks in long shot or medium frame, never closer, never intimate.\n\nMost curious was how these mechanical dreams confined themselves to single breaths, one shot containing all there was to tell, rarely stretching beyond sixty seconds of life. Yet even in this brevity there lay deception. What appeared whole was oftentimes stitched together from separate pieces, like a corpse reassembled for viewing. The Execution of Mary showed this truth plain enough - watch close and you'll see where they cut more than just the queen's head, splicing reality itself to serve their illusion.\n\nThese were our first lies told in light, our first attempts to make the impossible real through the sorcery of the machine. And like all lies, they held their own peculiar truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both old and new, a thing that carries within it the seeds of its own contradiction. Like some ancient tomb unearthed in modern soil it bears the weight of ages past while speaking to those who would dig it up anew. Ian Watt called it what it was. An oxymoron. Old-New. And men have praised it and damned it in equal measure, some saying it held no depth while others spoke of Burke's terrible sublime like preachers speaking of divine revelation.\n\nWhen Horace Walpole birthed the first true Gothic tale in The Castle of Otranto he didnt know what dark thing he had loosed upon the world. He took the ancient ways of romance and wedded them to something modern and in doing so created a bastard child that would outlive its father. The theatrical elements of old merged with what men called the mimicry of nature and from this union came what Walpole himself named A Gothic Story. The word gothic itself had been worn smooth by time and use, passed through countless mouths to describe peoples and buildings and times long dead. Some saw it as primitive. Backward. A thing best left in the past while society marched ever forward into what they called progress. But the marriage of theatrical gothic elements with the psychological intimacy of the novel created something that refused to die, that was somehow both ancient and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe ghost of chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that cannot rest. In Otranto the medieval notions of knightly virtue are both preserved and transformed, like a body that has been both mummified and mutilated. Walpole and his kind clung to these ideals of the brave and honorable knight precisely because such men had vanished from the world, if they had ever truly existed at all. The gothic past became a dream of something better, a time when men knew honor and duty and did not shy from either. Walpole wrote in dark times, when politics had grown foul and accusations flew like carrion birds. Perhaps he thought that something fundamental had been lost, some essential goodness that had once lived in men's hearts but had withered and died in the modern world. We see this most clearly in Frederic, a character who carries the weight of chivalric virtue like a crown of thorns. He comes to us first in description, a prince who has known suffering, who has walked away from tragedy, who men believe fell fighting the infidel. The gallant and courteous Knight exists in these pages as something larger than life, excessive in his virtue as all things in Gothic tales must be excessive.",
            "Supply chain it moves like a river through the land of commerce. Raw materials to finished goods flowing ever onward to the waiting hands of customers who know not from whence it came. In 1982 a man called Oliver gave name to this thing that had existed nameless since the first trader walked the first road with the first goods. He called it supply chain management and in doing so he captured the essence of planning and control and implementation that feeds the hunger of want.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Like ancient gods they stand watch over the flow of goods, and the men who tend to business bow before them seeking favor in the marketplace.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone laid deep in the bedrock of enterprise. It asks the questions that must be answered. When. Why. Where. How. The managers peer into the great void of the marketplace like seers reading entrails, seeking signs of what the people want. The market speaks in whispers of demand and they must listen close to hear its truth. Then they must decide what will be born into the world and in what numbers and from which wombs of industry it will come forth.\n\nI knew this truth when I worked the floors of Walmart and Target both. There was a scripture for everything. How to dress. How to move. How to receive the great trucks that came like metal beasts in the night bearing their cargo. Everything written down in books like industrial bibles telling all who would read them the proper way of things.\n\nSupply comes next in the procession. It speaks of capabilities and partnerships and the breaking of whole things into parts. Managers must look upon their domains and know which pieces fit where like some great industrial puzzle. Sometimes they must reach out beyond their walls to other makers and other doers, seeking that thing called velocity. Velocity that promises quality and flexibility while keeping the coin in the purse, though few who seek it truly find it.",
            "They were books of another time. Victorian they called them. All manner and detail laid out like bones in the desert sun, bleached white with aristocratic concern and societal affairs that meant nothing to the dead or dying. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart like dark sentinels in the gathering dusk, their pages filled with a mystery that crawled beneath the skin like fever dreams. They bore witness to things that proper society dared not speak of.\n\nIn one such passage the boy Oliver walks through a fevered haze. He walks with killers. With Sikes and Crackit who argue in voices that echo through his skull like gunshots in an empty church. The words come and go like wind through dead grass. Then the real shots ring out and the night explodes in fire and screaming and lights that dance like devil-moths against his eyes. Some force, nameless and terrible, drags him through the chaos while pain gnaws at him like a starved dog that won't let go.\n\nThese fever dreams run through both books like dark water through underground caves. In Oliver's tale they show what lies beneath, the rot and the fear and the helplessness of a child caught in the machinery of fate. When the shooting comes back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it comes like a visitation, like something holy and terrible both. The boy relives it all while his body searches for salvation it dont believe in. He's powerless. Always was. The pain aint even a surprise no more, just a companion walking beside him in the dark. The question aint about who shot him. The question is about whose will brought the boy to this place, because it sure wasnt his own. Old Fagin had worked his poison deep, wearing down the boy's spirit like water wearing down stone until there wasnt nothing left but acceptance of the dark.\n\nTime itself becomes a stranger. Day passes into night or maybe there never was a day at all. Just darkness bleeding into darkness while silence stretches out like a rope with no end.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces bent over books and papers in the late afternoon light. Most I could help well enough but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy called Adrian, might have been eight or nine, who couldn't read worth a damn. Something wasnt right with how he saw the letters. Some he knew like old friends and others may as well have been hieroglyphs scratched in ancient stone. His English was pure as mountain water but his blood was Mexican sure enough. We fought those letters like they were demons until the day his mother came.\n\nShe walked in while I was minding the stragglers left behind from some excursion. Not a word of English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish like soft bullets. My own Spanish was poor and broken but we made do with gestures and half-understood words. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer blow. Adrian could read just fine. It was our strange English letters that were foreign to him, not the words themselves. Whether that knowledge ever served him I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale because it speaks to something deeper, something that runs through the veins of our schools here in California like a dark current. The wall between languages aint always what you'd expect. Even a child who speaks English pure as springwater might stumble when the letters dance strange on the page. We all know this devil exists but the killing of it aint so simple. For Adrian the medicine was clear enough - teach him our letters, teach him our sounds. But for them that barely speak English the cure aint so clean. No single answer exists in this world or the next. Dual language learning, throwing them in the deep end, private teaching, special English classes - none of these alone will slay the beast. The truth lies in using them all like weapons in an arsenal.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching aint just for the Spanish speakers but for all our young ones. Studies show these children rise above their peers like hawks over field mice. Some folk fear it's wasteful, that most children won't gain nothing from it. That's a lie black as pitch. If we made this the way instead of the exception, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Force every teacher to speak two tongues? No, that's a fool's errand. But having them that can speak both languages helping in the classroom, that's no dream but a real possibility hard as iron.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of what mind can hold. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men in robes speak ancient words. Some take what their mothers and fathers gave them and hold it close like a blanket against the dark while others cast it away saying there aint nothing out there but what we know and what we see. And we take up these beliefs like weapons only to lay them down again for different ones when the first ones fail us. Each soul walking its own path through the spiritual dark searching for some light to lead it home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set there on the porch listening to the rain hammer the tin roof while smoke from our cigarettes rose up in pale wisps to join the clouds. Water poured from the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew there, petals beaten flat against the mud. He looked out into the gray distance with eyes that seemed to see both now and then at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's and his head showed pale through thinning hair. He wouldnt look at me. I knew I could not speak of what was coming for speaking makes real what we wish was not. I moved closer and hugged him and we sat there watching the June rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their predictions but what good was breath when it only meant more pain. What sort of god would craft such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers for if there was a god he had turned his face from me long ago.\n\nI would not watch him die. Could not. The life that gave me life deserved better than my witness to its ending. I knew him better than they did. Better than the blood kin that gathered round his bed. He would not want his child to watch death take him. So I lay curled in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline county and knew the soil like his own blood. John Taylor. Man of the earth and of words both. The land spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in that capacity too and the marriage of these things made him what he was. A voice crying out against the wilderness of government overreach. Against the darkness that men brought forth when they strayed from honest work.\n\nThe republic stood newborn on the continent like some vast experiment in human nature. No ancient ghosts to bind it. No old world chains to wear. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. The chance to build something true. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever power ruled the hearts of men were like bones in a skeleton. Break one and the whole thing goes wrong. Goes twisted. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government that would call itself just.\n\nIn the raw state of nature the strong preyed upon the weak and the clever preyed upon both but Taylor believed civilization must rise above such base instincts. Must find a way to account for the light and dark that dwelled in every human heart. Good and evil. No middle ground between them. He wrote that government carried all the virtues and vices of the men who wielded it, like a sword that could heal or harm depending on whose hand held the hilt.\n\nThe principles he called good were simple things. Protection of what a man owned. The enhancement of agriculture. The restraint of those who would profit from paper and promises rather than honest work. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but like fire it could warm a home or burn it down. Government must contain this force, must channel it, must be watched always lest it turn from servant to master.\n\nHe stood with others who read the Constitution like scripture, demanding every word be weighed and measured. The federal government must be bound tight, he said, kept small, kept lean, kept honest. A bloated government would turn tyrant as surely as meat turns rotten in summer heat. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be known, must be held sacred. The Declaration that came before was truer still, he thought. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation. Separate fires burning bright against the dark.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was done. The mind worked at it like some machine spinning in emptiness, taking in what lay before it and letting go again without holding to any truth or knowing. Thoughts came and went like smoke in a wind. No thought stayed.\n\nHe'd bought him a book once. Some woman artist had told him of it. About drawing and the mind and how these things worked together or didnt work together and how a man might learn to see what was before him truly and not just what his mind told him ought to be there. The book spoke of frames. How putting a frame around a thing made it something else entirely. How a kitchen full of things became just a bowl of fruit on a table if you framed it right.\n\nStanding there he couldnt frame nothing. The sight was too big for frames. Like them painters of old had their colors. Blues and greens and all the colors of God's earth. If he was to paint this scene it would be brown. Nothing but brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it. The muscles worked beneath the skin like creatures with their own purpose. Water moved in its ancient circles. Clear as light itself. Things broke apart in it and vanished. He worked the handle again. Faster now. Urgent. The brown mass stayed fixed like something alive and willful. Like it had made up its mind to stay.\n\nHe stood there in his tie that choked at his throat. Green like poison. Feet planted like a man about to receive news of death. The mop loose in his grip like a broken standard. Some previous visitor had left this offering. This message to them that cleaned the drugstore toilets. He flushed again and again and watched the water move and settle and move again. Then his hand went to the paper. Wrapping and wrapping until the hand was white as bone. He bent at the waist like a man in prayer. The hand went down into the water like something seeking baptism in darkness...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things but they dont need to tell what any fool can see with his own eyes. Inexperience sits heavy in their bones and death rides shotgun in their fathers pickup trucks.\n\nThe children gather like crows. Two then three then four in a car and the metal beast beneath them growls with promise and threat both. Studies done in California show what we already know in our hearts - that death multiplies with each young soul added to the cabin. Some states try to hold back the tide with their paper laws and provisional permits but its like trying to dam a river with chicken wire.\n\nZuckerman the headshrinker says eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of speed like junkies seek the needle and they cant help themselves no more than a rattler can help its poison. The boomers babies are coming he says. Coming like a flood to wash our roads in blood and metal and grief.\n\nThe answer lies simple as a coffin nail. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let them learn in classrooms and parking lots with teachers watching careful as priests. Make it the same in every state so there aint no place for death to slip through the cracks. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty with a grown soul watching. Numbers writ in law like commandments.\n\nThis aint new thinking.

            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the sounds wrong. Not in the hearing but in the knowing of what was heard. Like a radio playing through broken glass. The brain took the sounds and twisted them and made them strange and foreign though the ears worked just fine.\n\nThe disorder first showed itself in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with clinical minds sought to understand it. They worked in sterile rooms with machines and wires and children who could not parse the world of sound around them. Kimura came later with his tests of competing sounds fed into separate ears like twin serpents of noise coiling into the skull.\n\nThe affliction manifested in ways various and cruel. Some could not tell where sounds came from in the void of space as if they walked in darkness eternal. Others could not separate one sound from another or know when words meant their opposite through the tone of voice that carried them. The sounds came like waves breaking upon rocks, each one washing away the memory of the last until nothing remained but confusion.\n\nTo diagnose it they brought forth an arsenal of tests and observations like ancient priests seeking auguries in the behavior of their subjects. Audiologists and speech pathologists and psychologists all brought their tools to bear, watching and measuring and recording. They fed sounds into ears and measured the echoes that returned. But no single test could catch this ghost in the machine of the mind, and none could say from whence it came. It remained elusive as smoke, real as rain, present as pain.\n\nThey would sit children in rooms and bombard them with sounds, asking them to pluck meaning from chaos. Numbers and words would rain down like hail, and they would watch as the children struggled to catch them, to hold them, to make sense of the storm. Some could and some could not and in this way they separated the afflicted from the whole.",
            "They'd asked what I aimed to do and I told them plain. Work with the children. The broken ones. The ones cast off and forgotten like old shoes in a ditch. Them that's been touched by darkness that walks in daylight wearing the skin of kin. Values aint just words wrote down in some book. They're carved deep in the bone. Service. Respect. The old ways of right and wrong that dont bend nor break.\n\nI'd wandered some years not knowing my path. Watched folks run from their demons or drown em in whatever poison they could find. Got myself some learning in the ways of the mind at Piedmont College in 09 but still the path weren't clear. Then come a summer day I'll not forget. Boy of sixteen set on my friend's couch like a sparrow ready to fly. Eyes darting. Hands working at nothing. Running from them that should've protected him but didn't.\n\nNext day I drove out to where he come from. Talked to the law standing in that yard where evil had made its home. Told em what I knew from my schooling. They asked me to speak to the parents and I did. Watched em squirm and lie, calling their boy's cry for help manipulation. Simple disputes, they said. Nothing simple about it. That's when I knew what I had to do.\n\nJustice aint just a word neither. Society talks about the worth of one soul while trying to make every soul look the same. I never did hold with that. Through them school years I made my stand. Wore my colors like war paint. Put metal in my flesh where I pleased. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Fought the old poisons of hate and fear wherever they showed their face. Some folks say protest aint proper. I say there aint nothing more proper than standing against what's wrong.\n\nThat's the truth of it. Plain as I can tell it.",
            "The night comes and with it the darkness that some cannot escape into sleep. There are those who walk among us bearing the curse of wakefulness, their minds racing like wild horses across the vast plains of consciousness while others find peace in the void. They call it insomnia but names mean little to those who suffer its relentless grip.\n\nThe men of science speak of two paths to understanding this affliction. One path leads through blood and bone, through the twisted helixes of our making that we inherit from those who came before. The other winds through the territories of man's own making - the streets and alleys of culture, the borderlands of race and wealth, the dark canyons between rich and poor.\n\nIn the laboratories they keep their mice in plastic boxes, watching as the creatures struggle between wake and sleep. The scientists speak of things called GABAB receptors, tiny gatekeepers in the hypothalamus that stand watch over the kingdom of sleep. They inject their potions - baclofen they call it - and observe as the mice surrender to unconsciousness. As if mice could tell us the secrets of human suffering.\n\nThey mapped these territories of sleep like ancient cartographers, drawing borders between what they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, primary disorders and secondary ones. Names upon names, categories within categories, as if naming a thing could capture its essence. Nightmare Disorder. Sleep Terror. Sleepwalking. Words that try to cage the uncageable.\n\nIn the end it all comes down to the firing of neurons in the dark meat of our brains, the dance of chemicals across synaptic gaps, the inheritance of cursed genes passed down like dark heirlooms through generations. And those who cannot sleep walk among us like ghosts, haunting fluorescent-lit offices and sterile classrooms, their eyes heavy with the weight of endless days.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The campus stretches vast and merciless, a concrete expanse that swallows souls and time alike. In my first year they put me in East Halls, far out where the morning sun first touches university soil, beyond where most students dare venture save for football and spectacle.\n\nThe path from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage. Twenty-five minutes through rain or snow or whatever god saw fit to cast down upon us. The old ones speak of times when East stood alone, islands of brick and mortar in seas of empty land. Now steel and glass rise where emptiness once dwelled. The Creamery. The healing house. Apartments like teeth in a giant's mouth surrounding it all. The campus grows like some living thing, consuming space, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nWhat salvation exists for those who must traverse these spaces? The bicycle stands alone. Simple machine. Two wheels and frame and chain. But it aint enough to have the machine. You need the riders and you need the paths that welcome them.\n\nI knew a man who returned to the wheel after years away. Said he couldn't reckon why he ever stopped. Called it the only true way to move through this world. A bowl of morning grain can power you thirty miles or more, he said, and I reckon he spoke true.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bike was wisdom purchased cheap. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes by foot from my door, but the wheels cut it to five if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but aint always friendly to those who'd ride it. Walking has its merits but time is precious as blood in this place. Without the bike I'd lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day to walking. Two and a half hours every week vanished like morning mist. Add the other wanderings required of a student's life and time becomes a currency you cant afford to spend.",
            "He saw the machines coming and knew their masters well. The World Controllers and their ilk. They had built their glass towers and concrete hives where men moved like insects, each to their own predetermined place in the great mechanism of society. The conditioning began at birth, perhaps before. No man could say. They called it community but it was a prison of the soul.\n\nThe people walked through their lives like sleepwalkers, pursuing pleasure with the mindless determination of addicts. They knew nothing of struggle or pain or the raw truth of existence. The Controller stood above them all like some dark god, dispensing soma and satisfaction in measured doses. Marx had seen it coming. The way the powerful would bend the minds of the weak until they could no longer recognize their own chains.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. No hatred neither. Just the endless cycle of consumption and shallow gratification. The men spoke of women like they spoke of machines, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities and physical dimensions. The women traded stories of their couplings with the detached interest of cattle traders. Each class moved in its ordained circles, never questioning, never rising above their station. The Alphas and Betas, those who might have seen the truth of things, chose blindness instead. All except Bernard, who carried his doubt like a wound.\n\nThe lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, the rest - they were born to their servitude, their minds shaped before they drew first breath. Sleep-teaching had burned away any chance of rebellion or discontent. They consumed and labored and died, believing themselves blessed in their ignorance. The great machinery of capitalism ground on, feeding on their dreams, their desires, their very humanity. And above it all the Controller watched, counting his profits in the coin of human souls.",
            "Four years past I sat in a classroom where they spoke of Islam, voices rising and falling like wind through desert scrub. The question hung there like smoke: was this faith born of violence. Now in these days the question burns hotter still, a flame that won't die down. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and talking heads shifted from raw hatred to something else, something like submission. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers in the dark corners of time. They say he was a peaceful man but I know different. Know how he rode with warriors across the sands, how tribes fell before him like wheat before the scythe, how the sword and the word went hand in hand. Yet in these pages they paint him gentle as a lamb, a martyr walking soft in the world until men saw truth in his eyes and followed. Followed like sheep to water.\n\nAnd there in those pages they write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like some dark echo of another story, older and truer. As if taking the bread and fish from Christ's own hands and putting them in another's. A theft of holy things. Making mockery of sacred blood.\n\nThey tell these tales second-hand, third-hand, passed down like old coins worn smooth with handling. Each teller adding his own truth until truth itself becomes suspect. Like smoke rising from a fire you cannot see.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. Made him meek and mild when history shows his sword arm was strong and his will was iron. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca five times daily know the true face of the man they follow. Know the blood that stains the pages of their past.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he knew in his time upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind, scattered and forgotten in the wake of what men would later call Christian thought. Looking back across the wasteland of centuries we see only the long retreat from truth, each generation stepping further from the light into a darkness of their own making. Yet now in these latter days there comes a stirring, like wind across the desert floor, a wakening that cannot be stilled.\n\nThe old ones still cling to their beliefs like drowning men to driftwood, but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade. Among the faithful there rises a hunger for what was lost, a need to strip away the accretions of time like layers of dead skin until nothing remains but the raw truth of what the Nazarene brought forth from God. It may take generations, maybe centuries, but the wheel turns backward now and cannot be stopped.\n\nThis great undoing will sweep across the lands like wildfire, burning away the false doctrines that men have built, leaving only ash and truth behind. The church will endure, yes, but changed, transformed, stripped back to bone and sinew. Where once a thousand voices sang different songs there will be one voice, one truth, one way. Like rivers flowing backward to their source, all the scattered tribes of Christ will flow together again.\n\nHistory shows us such reversals. Rome that once drank Christian blood became Christ's greatest temple. This land that once bound men in chains now sees those same men's sons in seats of power. And so it will be with the faith itself, unspooling like a thread pulled from an ancient tapestry, until we stand again at the beginning.\n\nBut mark this well: the key that unlocks this door lies in seeing the Christ's words not as dead letters carved in stone but as living water, flowing with meaning beyond mere words. To understand what came after, we must first look back to what came before.\n\nIn those ancient days there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which Christianity would flow. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the foundations laid before Rome's eagles cast their shadow over Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the people were divided, split like dry wood - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew little of such things.",
            "The darkness that dwells in the heart of man aint nothing new and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Shows how the greed lives deep in the marrow of our bones and how we care nothing for them below us in the great chain of misery that binds us all. You can see it clear as death in them factory owners and managers, them lords of industry who built their empires on broken backs and spilled blood.\n\nThey built their kingdoms of steel and smoke, caring nothing for what lay crushed beneath. Sinclair wrote of how them buildings stood like black teeth against the sky, chimney stacks vomiting endless streams of smoke into the heavens, as if trying to poison God himself. The smoke rolled away toward the horizon like some great serpent, coiling and twisting until it disappeared where the earth meets the sky. The owners, they didnt care none for the poison they put into the air or the filth that ran from their slaughterhouses, rivers of blood and worse things that no man should have to name.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Disposable as the hogs they butchered. There wasnt no loyalty in that place, no decency neither. A man's worth was measured in pennies and dollars, his life cheaper than the copper in his pocket. They worked them men like mules and cast them aside just as quick, no warning, no mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with invisible blood.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown, they was caught in a web of their own making, though they didnt weave it themselves. No escape from the grinding machinery of industry that ate men whole and spit out bones. The unions that was supposed to help only fed off their misery like vultures on carrion. The foreign workers, them that came seeking the American dream, found instead an American nightmare. They hung there between life and death, survival dependent on the whims of men who was no better than the slave drivers of old. Their suffering was as certain as winter frost, their degradation as inevitable as darkness following light. And there aint no law of God or man that could save them from it.",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things dont matter now and didnt matter then. The word Thulé appeared twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, borrowed perhaps from Virgil who'd used it to name some distant shore beyond Britain where the Greeks reckoned the world fell away into darkness. But there was something else. Something closer.\n\nThe German writers had gotten into his blood. Among them was Goethe whose words Poe knew well enough that scholars like Karl J. Arndt would later trace the shadowed footprints between their works, seeing in Poe's lines an echo of the master's voice.\n\nGoethe himself was dead by then. His Faust lay in two parts like a bifurcated serpent, the first coiled in 1808 and the second dying with him in 1832. Within those pages there was a tale of a king and his dead queen and a goblet that carried both memory and grief. The king drank deep and wept deeper until at last he walked to the edge of all things and cast the cup into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into the dark. It wasnt hard to see Poe's own darkness there, his own cup of sorrow, his own dead love.\n\nThe word Thule appeared again in The Pit and the Pendulum but it was in Dream-Land where it found its true home, standing guard at beginning and end like black-robed sentries. The landscapes of both tales stretched out across the same wastes: colorless, empty, populated only by ghosts and memories that wouldnt die proper deaths but lingered like smoke in still air.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work as surely as he knew his own demons. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German and in doing so revealed his own. The words had been there all along, waiting in translations and adaptations, seeping into the soil of American letters like blood into sand.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it is darker than any book of statutes. In the failing light of an October evening in California a manager sat eating his dinner while death or something like it waited patient in the aisles of his store. The spill lay there like some primordial ooze, transparent and lethal, the crushed remains of apples processed and jarred and shipped and spilled and now forming a slick that would alter the course of lives yet unknown.\n\nThey came to him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan bearing news of the hazard but Martin would not be moved from his repast. He sat unmoved and uncaring like some petty god pronouncing judgment on the affairs of mortals beneath his notice. The store bore already the history of five who had fallen that year alone, their bodies caught in gravities cruel embrace, but such things did not trouble Martin's thoughts.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if ordained. Her back broke not with a sound but with a feeling, something ancien and terrible coursing through bone and sinew. The law speaks of conscious disregard and willful negligence but these are just words meant to cage the darkness in mens hearts. Martin knew what lay in wait in his domain. Knew it as sure as he knew the taste of the food he would not leave. Knew it as sure as he knew of those who had fallen before.\n\nThe question before the judge is one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether such calculated indifference rises to the level of malice that the law demands for special retribution. The evidence speaks clear enough. Six times the floor had claimed its tribute in that year alone. Two warnings ignored while dinner grew cold. These are not mere oversights but markers on a map leading to something darker in the soul of man. The law may speak of summary judgments but no judge would dare dismiss such darkness without letting light shine full upon it.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a thing alive. It had come upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a shadow companion through the years that followed. By seventeen it had shaped itself not into want of things but of someone, though no boy that crossed her path stirred anything in her blood. They came and went like leaves in autumn, their awkward advances scattered to wind. She studied this emptiness in herself like studying tracks in sand, theories rising and falling away like tide, none substantial enough to hold weight.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world and spoke softer still. Arguments were rare as rain in drought season, save when their daughter's wild spirit pressed against the walls of their quiet life like wind through canyon walls. She carried within her a fire that burned bright against their stillness, yet it was a warmth that drew others near, not a consuming flame.\n\nBut this day carried darkness. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed she heard her mother's cry cut through the kitchen air sharp as breaking glass. She ran. Found her mother crumpled on tile like a broken bird. Pain wrapped round her mother's words tight as barbed wire. Hospital, she managed. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering their training, and she bore her mother out like precious cargo through the door and into the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air hung thick with bleach and suffering and fear but she noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She carried her through doors that whispered open, voice rising raw for help. White-coated figures materialized like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother whole. Then she was alone with the waiting.\n\nAll this because her mother had reached too high, seeking some ceramic beauty in cabinets that touched the ceiling. The stepping stool had betrayed her like false ground giving way beneath trusted feet.",
            "The dead speak in numbers and the living count their meals. They sought truth in the eating habits of women, watching what passed their lips like priests taking count of sins. Mediterranean fare they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from fruits that grew in ancient soils. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts kept sparse upon their plates. Wine in moderation like a sacrament.\n\nThey had seen before how this way of eating kept death at bay. Studies writ in blood and paper showed how hearts beat longer, stronger when fed thus. The fat ones shed their burden easier this way than counting grams of lard and butter. But none had watched the brain and how it fails when vessels burst.\n\nThey gathered seventy-four thousand women and more, nurses all, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. For twenty years they watched them eat and die or live. Six times they made them write their testimony of meals, marking down each morsel like confessions. Most stayed true to the watching, year after year, while some vanished into the dark of time.\n\nThe counters of meals verified their methods. When death came they checked the records, the papers of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable when proof was thin, these made up less than a quarter of the fallen.\n\nThey weighed the women, noted their smoke and pills, their monthly cycles and the hormones they took. How they moved their bodies in leisure counted too. The numbers they gathered like crows collecting bright things, seeking patterns in the chaos of living.\n\nWhen the counting ended, the truth lay bare in figures cold as corpses. Two thousand hearts failed, seventeen hundred brains bled or starved, and a thousand souls departed through paths carved by broken vessels. Those who ate as the ancients did, who scored highest in their Mediterranean ways, they lived longer. The numbers spoke clear: their risk of failing hearts and minds fell by more than a quarter compared to those who ate as modern folk do.\n\nIn the end, the numbers told a story old as olive groves: how we eat marks how we die.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma the sign said. The girl stood there holding it above her head like some proclamation of doom writ in black ink against the cardboard. She was an actor in films. The kind that made people feel good about themselves.\n\nIn the east where the sun rises red over jungle and plain there is a country of ghosts. Burma they called it once. Myanmar now. Men in uniform took it like thieves in the night. They came in 1962 with guns and proclamations and they never left. The monks rose up against them wearing robes colored like dried blood. Saffron they called it. The monks walked and they prayed and the people followed them into the streets like children following the piper. At first the men with guns watched. Then they didnt. They came in the night with their boots and their rifles and broke down the doors of the monasteries. Sacred places violated by the godless. A Japanese man with a camera died on a street corner. Just another body. They said thirteen died but a soldier who ran told different. Thousands he said. Thousands of bodies. Where they buried them no one knows.\n\nIt aint nothing new. Since man first walked upright and found he could rule over others by force there have been such things. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who said they were gods themselves. Even now men who wear suits instead of crowns claim to speak for god while they deal in death.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. In China they gunned down students in a square while tanks rolled past. The government said three hundred. The truth was thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. The streets ran with blood and no one came to help. And before all that there was Hitler. He killed millions. Rounded them up like cattle. Branded them. Burned them. Made them into smoke that rose up to accuse the very heavens. And now perhaps his spirit walks in Burma where the monks once walked. Where the dead lay unnamed in unmarked graves. Where the men with guns still rule.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington ran deep through the veins of jazz like old blood through ancient stone, his years stretched long across the century and with them came power to shape sound and men alike. At the piano his touch was light as morning frost but in the writing of music he was more akin to some dark demiurge, crafting worlds of sound where men could walk free yet bound, improvising within the walls he built note by note, bar by bar. He knew these men, knew their souls and the sounds that lived in them, knew how to call forth those sounds like a conjurer of old spirits. The orchestra was his instrument and he played it like some great and terrible organ, pulling stops and pressing keys that were the very souls of men.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of Grove they speak of his Creole Love Call, how he made the human voice cry out like brass and wood, wordless and pure as desert wind. Through six circles of blues it winds, each a testament to his craft. First comes the voice against reeds like two wolves calling across valley darkness, then the muted trumpet wailing blue notes into the void. High above a clarinet keens while piano notes fall like rain beneath. The full band rises then, brass and reed locked in their eternal dance, until all culminates in a great crescendo where reeds cry out against the syncopated heartbeat of brass and rhythm. At last the voice returns, growling like some nightbound creature, before all ends in discord and darkness.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded when the moon had walked another year across the sky, he bound together the tight-wound strings of orchestration with colors drawn from the very air. Miley's trumpet called and Cox's voice answered, man and instrument trading places in some strange alchemy of sound. And when It Don't Mean a Thing rose up from silence, there was Nanton, called Tricky Sam by those who knew him, drawing forth the melody from his muted horn like an old priest reading ancient scripture, the sound of it hanging in the air like smoke from a long-dead fire.",
            "They come to ask why things change the way they do. As if the world held answers plain and true for those who'd seek them. Back in 1917 a man called Thompson spoke of how we ain't yet learned to put numbers to the shapes of living things and truth be told we ain't much further along now neither.\n\nThe shells lay there like ancient scrolls writ in a language we barely understand. They spiral through time and space like cosmic dancers frozen in calcium carbonate, each whorl telling its own tale of life and death and change. We took to studying these Prunum shells, their ghostly forms caught in X-ray light, trying to capture their essence in numbers and equations like trying to trap starlight in a jar.\n\nThe shell grows like a living cathedral, turning through the void in perfect mathematical arcs that we ain't yet got the wisdom to fully comprehend. Each revolution marks time like the rings of a tree or the layers of earth in canyon walls. The columella stands at the center like some ancient axis mundi, holding everything together while the whorls spiral out around it like a sermon on creation itself.\n\nYou can read these shells like a book if you know how. Count the whorls from where the first suture begins, marking time in quarter turns like some cosmic clock. The aperture traces its path through space leaving behind it this perfect geometric testament to life's endless variations. Each shell carries in its form the history of its kind, written in calcium and protein, waiting for them as can read such things.\n\nWe fed these measurements into machines, trying to capture in silicon and electricity what nature had wrought in lime and water over millions of years. The numbers dance across screens like prophets speaking in tongues, telling tales of what might have been and what yet could be. But the truth of it all remains elusive, like trying to catch smoke in your hands or hold back the tide with a broom.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like fallen birds in their mothers' arms, their numbers unchanging through the years, a dark testament to a nation's struggle. Ten years passed and still they died, these small ones, while men in offices spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams. They spoke of water flowing clean and proper places to shit but the children kept dying all the same and the mothers too, their blood flowing out across dirt floors in villages where no doctor ever set foot.\n\nIn the cities they had women who knew the old ways of birth, midwives they called them, their hands skilled in the catching of babies but helpless when the darkness came and the blood wouldn't stop. Seven of ten births they attended but it wasnt enough. Never enough. The diarrhea came for the young ones too and fewer hands reached out to help them now than before. After the births the mothers lay alone, no one watching for the fever or the bleeding that might take them in the night.\n\nThe knife that opens the belly to free the child, they called it cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. In the cities maybe seven women in a hundred felt its mercy but in the villages only two. The poor died easier than the rich, that's how it always was and how it remained. Twenty-seven souls in a hundred turned away from the hospital door, their pockets empty as their hopes.\n\nThey argued about it in their offices with their papers and their coffee. Some said to build special programs like towers reaching to heaven, each one targeting its own kind of death. Others wanted to strengthen what was already there, the bones and sinews of the healing places. The tower-builders talked fast about quick results but they didn't speak of how their grand designs pulled the healers away from other work, how the money flowed to one place while other needs withered like crops in drought. And everywhere the paper multiplied like leaves in autumn, forms upon forms, each program demanding its own kind of truth written in its own kind of way.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, sprouting genres like weeds in an abandoned field till no man could count them all. And within each genre - the rap and the rock and the country and all their kin - subspecies breed and multiply like dark thoughts in a fever dream.\n\nHeavy Metal, bastard child of rock, has perhaps grown most feral of all. Forty years it has roamed the musical wasteland, gathering darkness unto itself like a shroud. It feeds on emotion - raw and bleeding emotions that decent folk dont speak of. Early on the people saw how this beast could be trained, could be bred into new forms. And breed it did. New forms begat newer forms until the original creature was lost in the thundering herd of its progeny.\n\nNow the beast has so many faces that men argue what truly makes the metal what it is. It has consumed other genres, digested them, made them its own. To know the thing you must go back. Back to where it first crawled from the primordial muck of music. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal lives in darkness. It is a thing of excess - excess in all things. In volume and violence and theatrical display. Its practitioners are skilled beyond mere playing, they are technicians of chaos. And there are the drugs. Always the drugs. In the middle years of the seventies the drugs came like a flood and the music turned strange and otherworldly. Men made records that normal folk couldn't comprehend and blamed it on the chemicals coursing through their veins. The darkness in it was new. Popular music hadn't known such shadows before. Later metal drew from the old Romantics, those who knew darkness too. Even the Beatles, those clean-cut boys, succumbed. Their Helter Skelter was among the first, a response to the Stones' own darkness. They wanted to prove they could walk in those shadows too.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own dreams both in sleep and in waking. The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman struck dumb by the savage beauty of a dreamed land but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings wrought in oils and pigments. He had long sought the approval of those who deemed themselves fit to judge such things, those who spoke in hushed tones in gilded halls about what made art worthy and what did not. And in this seeking he found himself torn between two paths, each stretching out before him like roads in some dark wood. One path led to mimicry and conformity, the other to a wild independence that knew no masters.\n\nThe man himself came into this world on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town that squatted in the northwestern reaches of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware, living well enough by the standards of those days. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls for the state, a gabelou they called him though some named him douanier which was not right but stuck to him all the same. His first wife Clémence passed into whatever darkness awaits us all, following eight babes who never drew breath long enough to know the world. Only Julia remained, his daughter, while grief sat heavy upon him like some ancient stone. He turned to painting then as a man turns to water in the desert, seeking salvation in the sweep of brush against canvas.\n\nUnlike the others who painted in those days, men who made the peasants into something fine and noble in their pictures, Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common men dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, men like Matisse who had learned their craft in proper schools and whose names carried weight in the salons where such things mattered. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to paint so well and true that the Artiste Français would welcome him into their ranks. But such things were not to be, not then, not in the way he hoped.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road and maybe they do. The great minds spoke of it and wrote of it in their books and papers yellowed now with age, their words fading like the memories of dead men. Keats knew it when he wrote of that old urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty back to truth in some eternal dance that none could parse nor need to.\n\nWe learn what we know from books and life and pain but these things, these twin spirits of right and beautiful, they come to us like night comes to the desert. No teacher showed us how. No mother pointed to a sunset and said here child this is beauty mark it well. We know it in our bones like ancient things know the earth.\n\nYou can write about why something's right or wrong or beautiful or damned but the words just scatter like birds from a field when the truth of it comes round. Take that painting of the woman with the smile. Men have spent lifetimes talking about shadow and light and what lies behind those eyes but none of it tells you why it catches in your throat when you stand before it. There's something else there. Something that won't be caught in words no matter how fine the net we weave.\n\nO'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to tell some truths and even then the telling wasn't complete. Like trying to describe the taste of water to a man who's never drunk. Wittgenstein too, though he used bigger words to say the same thing. That ethics lives somewhere beyond where words can reach.\n\nAnd there's the heart of it. The moral and the beautiful, they live in that space between what we can say and what we can know. Like old ghosts that we can feel but never touch. That's why books carry such weight with us. They're not just words on pages but mirrors of the soul, showing us what's right and wrong in ways we can't explain but know deep in that place where knowing starts. They carry values like a river carries water, flowing through us, shaping us, but never quite letting us hold them still enough to study.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, its borders drawn in blood and stone from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the cold gray waters of Kiel where the Baltic laps at shores old as memory itself. This land speaks with one voice, though its tongue differs from the Rhine-blessed Köln through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe cuts its path like a steel thread through time. That such a place should birth itself from many wombs seems ordained, written in the very soil that bore the tribes of old.\n\nIn the time before time Germania lay vast and dark, its name a whispered thing that scholars still war over like ravens fighting for carrion. Tacitus, that Roman chronicler of blood and conquest, spoke of the Tungrians who bore the name German before crossing the Rhine to wage their war against the Gauls. Caesar too marked these people in his accounts, dipping his pen in both ink and blood to tell of the Germanic hordes that crossed the great river with malice in their hearts. He borrowed their name from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd broken from those who still stood free beyond his reach. Some say the word meant neighbor in that ancient speech, while others claim it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, or maybe it came from Irish words meaning to cry out, as if the very name could capture the battle-howls of a people who knew nothing but war.\n\nTacitus wrote of them again in his Germania, claiming them pure as winter snow, untouched by foreign blood or strange customs. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern lands for this raw country where the sky itself seemed to wage war on those below? What man would choose such a place unless it was already burned into his bones?\n\nAnd Rome, that great devourer of lands and men, sent its legions north but never truly claimed these forests and marshlands as their own. They came for amber and iron, for slaves and glory, but always they returned south, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices. These people dwelt in the shadow of empire, trading goods torn from the earth and the strength of their sword arms in service to Rome's eagles, but they remained their own masters, waiting in the dark forests for their time to come.",
            "The shadows of deception run deep in Twelfth Night where masks and falsehoods serve their purpose until they don't and a soul must cast off its borrowed skin lest it be forever lost in the dark corridors of its own making. There aint no easy way back from such deceptions neither. A body finds itself cast out standing alone in the cold world of truth having to choose between keeping what's left of their own self or holding onto them that's around them. Some folk take kindly to learning they been fooled while others carry that betrayal like a wound that won't heal.\n\nWhen it comes to them that choose to wear the clothes of the opposite sex the matter gets darker still. The question that haunts like a ghost in an empty room is why. Why does a person turn their back on what God gave them to take up false dress. With Viola we know. She speaks it plain: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang there like a confession.\n\nBeing cast upon strange shores Viola done what she had to do to keep breathing in a world that would sooner see her dead. Her deception worked right enough but it cut her off from her own kind leaving her to walk alone among women who couldn't know her true self. And then there's Olivia who looks at her with eyes full of love meant for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The weight of it all bears down harder still when Orsino speaks words that cut like knives: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThem that read this tale now might see something different in it. Might see how lies can sometimes dig up truths that were buried deep. Olivia and Orsino both carry something inside them that Viola's presence forces into the light. Whether Olivia loves Cesario cause she sees a man or cause something else stirs in her blood aint clear but Shakespeare seems to be mocking them that judge only by what their eyes tell them.\n\nYou can see it plain when Olivia turns her love from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a prairie fire jumping track and starts calling Viola sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words fall final like stones in still water.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across African plains. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names that echoed like hollow bells in the void of their extinction. But empires aint never been simple things to reckon with and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, each claw marking the soil different from the last.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Black faces bent over books in the harsh light, words swimming before their eyes like strange fish in deeper waters. The British came in 1919 and found what the Germans had built there. Schools standing like sentinels in the dust. But south and west it was different. There the missionaries walked alone among the people, government coin scarce in their pockets while white children sat in proper schools built with proper means.\n\nThe land there was different too. Not the killing heat of other territories but something more temperate, more forgiving to European blood. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand, these pale riders in a foreign land. More than anywhere else in that scattered empire. They built their world there atop the old one, like layers of sediment pressing down through time.\n\nThe books tell it different ways. German words stacked in neat rows speaking of systems and methods, of civilizing missions in distant lands. Later came the English writers, comparing one piece of earth against another, measuring success in literacy rates and school attendance like counting cattle at auction. Cohen wrote of it too, saying the whites who settled there shaped everything that came after, their presence heavy as lead in the African soil.\n\nBut the truth of it was simpler and harder both. In some places knowledge flowed like water and in others it dried up in the sun, leaving nothing but bare earth and forgotten promises. That was the way of empires. That was the way of men.",
            "They stood there at the border, these two nations, like ancient enemies carved from the same stone. From 1836 to 1893 they warred and watched each other across that line drawn in blood and dust. Fifty-seven years. The war came in 46 and when it was done Mexico lay bleeding and the victor claimed Texas and all the southwest territories like a great carrion bird picking clean the bones of the defeated.\n\nThey fought as men have always fought, for land and pride and the old hatreds that sleep in the hearts of nations. The Americans and the Mexicans carried within them the seeds of their discord - religion, culture, the weight of history itself pressing down upon them like a stone. As it has always been with nations that share borders, that invisible line drawn across the earth became a wound that would not heal.\n\nIn those times the Americans feared what lay south as they had once feared the old specters of their colonial past - Catholicism, monarchy, the Spanish crown that had ruled these lands before them. Like their cold war with the Soviets that would come later, though this was different. This was older. This was blood.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those fifty-seven years. Bandits and raiders crossed that line drawn in sand, ghosting across the desert night to strike at border towns. Both sides sent soldiers to guard that boundary but still the blood flowed. The raids continued until both nations brought their armies to bear, two giants facing each other across the void.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor, like a wounded animal learning to trust the hand that once struck it. The American hunger changed too, from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred faded like tracks in the desert sand, but the memory remained, etched in the bones of both lands.",
            "The sickness came without warning like some dark rider in the night. Fifteen years past now. I was a nurse then, having chose that path not from want but from need, the kind that grows deep in your bones when you've known nothing but want as a child. They'd say you'll never want for work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing arts instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone in the world save for what little I earned and now even that was gone. Fifteen years lived on government mercy and everything I ever called mine has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and pride. Nothing certain now cept uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: without the charity of blood kin and them few true friends I'd have been dead or worse. When calamity comes it strips a body of all pretense of strength.\n\nAin't no man can outrun disaster forever. No matter how you fortify against it some things just too big for one soul to weather alone. The government basket's got holes and the bottom's bout to give way but I'd sooner see Americans learning to trust their neighbor again than watch em all dig separate holes in the ground like scared rabbits.\n\nThey talk bout rugged individualism like it was some kind of gospel truth but what kept our ancestors breathing weren't going it alone. It was breaking bread together and sharing what little they had. Them wagon trains that crossed the mountains didn't make it on account of lone wolves but because they moved as one.\n\nSo yeah, keep your disaster kit. Your pure water tablets and window tape and matches that'll light in a flood. Stack your canned goods high if you got the space. Plant your garden if the good Lord gave you dirt to plant in. But while you're doing all that surviving, might want to learn your neighbor's name. Cause when the real trouble comes, and it will come, ain't no man an island worth living on.",
            "In the old world, before the time of iron and steel and the great machines that would come to rule the earth, there was born a prince. He who would later be known as Buddha. The ancient scrolls speak of his coming in the fifth or sixth century before the Christ child and how he cast aside the riches of his station to wander the dusty roads of existence until enlightenment found him like a thief in the night. His words spread like wildfire through the dry grass of men's souls and from these words came Buddhism, its oldest and most pure form being what men call Theravada.\n\nTwenty five hundred years have passed since then. The religion stands transformed like a tree that has weathered countless storms, its branches twisted by time and circumstance. In Sri Lanka they still perform the water-cutting ceremony, though Buddha himself never spoke of such things. Monks in saffron robes and common folk alike gather at the waters edge, their faces reflecting in the dark surface like ancient memories. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the very marrow of what the religion means and what it promises to those who follow its path.\n\nThe changes came from within and without, like wounds that both fester and heal. Some brought by those who walked the path and some by those who stood against it. Some meant to destroy and others changed things without meaning to, like a child who breaks a pottery vessel while reaching for water.\n\nThese forces that shaped the faith came in pairs like dark riders on the horizon. Internal and external. One born of the faithful, be they monk or layman, and one from those who stood outside the walls of belief. Some came with knives drawn and hatred in their hearts, seeking to cut down what Buddha had built. Others came without malice, changing things by their mere presence like wind shapes stone. All these forces moved through the world like spirits, leaving their mark on the faith that Buddha left behind.\n\nThe heart of it beats still. The triple gem they call it: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma holds the ancient words in three vessels - the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its laws, and the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of all things. They speak of Anatta - the absence of soul, of Dukkha - the suffering that walks with all living things, and of Anicca - how nothing endures. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the great wheel of death and rebirth that turns like a millstone grinding souls to dust. When the wheel stops, so too do the three poisons: desire that burns like fever, hatred cold as stone, and delusion that clouds the mind like river mist."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture moves like a shadow through the rooms where men gather to strike their bargains. It aint what you might call a thing you can hold in your hand nor measure with any tool made by man. It lives in the spaces between words and in the silences that follow them. They say all Russians is stubborn and all Japanese bend like reeds in the wind but such notions is for children and fools who aint never set foot beyond their own fenceline.\n\nThe truth of it lies deeper, like groundwater in limestone country. A man comes to foreign soil carrying his own truth like a tattered map, trying to overlay it on ground that won't conform. Some study histories writ in blood and bone, others parse out ancient grievances passed down like family silver. But judgment aint worth the breath spent speaking it. You got to take the world as it lays before you, especially when you come to the table with a weaker hand. And if youre standing on someone else's ground you best mind their ways or find yourself alone with your principles.\n\nCorporate culture aint no different from tribal custom, just younger and dressed in better cloth. Some outfits work their people like ranch horses, others let em graze easy. You see it in their clothes and in how they speak to one another, whether they pass orders down like military command or let em float like dandelion seeds. Even in one company the culture shifts like weather from city to prairie, from coast to heartland. Some folk think certain cultures is all of one piece but that's just the surface of deep water.\n\nValues is the bedrock under it all. They tell you why a man will smile while losing or fight to the death over a word spoke wrong. In some places saving face matters more than profit and in others the deal is everything. A smart man learns these things before he sets foot in the room. But smarter still is the one who knows his opponent as a man and not just a shape cast by culture's long shadow.",
            "He'd read it there in the old book, written in ink now faded and brown upon pages thin as onionskin. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. Words from Psalm fourteen and again in the writings of Anselm, that old saint who'd wrestled with the very notion of divine existence like Jacob with his angel in the dark. And after him came Thomas, called Aquinas, both men seeking to pin down with words what could not be captured by mere language alone.\n\nThey were hunters of the same prey, these two, though their methods differed as night from day. To compare them proper we must accept their quarry as real, their God as true - not some shapeless deity conjured by philosophers but the God of scripture, terrible and magnificent. Yet neither man, for all their wisdom, could lay bare the full truth of it.\n\nAnselm's way was the way of the inner eye, searching the depths of understanding like a man might search a well for his own reflection. His argument ran thus: that God exists in the mind and therefore must exist in truth, for how can the mind conceive of that which cannot be? A circular path perhaps, like a dog chasing its tail, yet not without its own strange logic. Faith seeking understanding, he called it. As if understanding itself was a creature that could be hunted down and caught.\n\nBut Thomas would have none of this inner searching. He was a man of the world, of stone and flesh and bone. His God left tracks in the physical world, footprints that any man with eyes could follow. Five trails he mapped out: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and the great dance of creation itself. Like a man finding a dead fire and knowing by the ash and coal that someone had been there before him. No faith required, he said. Just eyes to see and a mind to reason.\n\nThey were both right and both wrong, these ancient hunters of truth. Like blind men describing an elephant, each touching a different part and swearing they knew the whole of it. But the truth was bigger than either of them knew, and remains so still.",
            "Writers lay their words like traps in the dark. Some catch their prey and some dont. Fitzgerald he laid his words careful like in that book about Gatsby. Sometimes he would take two words that had no business being together and wed them anyway like a shotgun marriage in some backwater town. Other times he'd pick up some thing, could be anything, and make it mean something else entirely. Like colors. Gold and green and white and red and all manner of hues that aint just hues no more but carriers of meaning dark as blood.\n\nIn that book about Gatsby he took to using white and gray and red like they was omens. White and gray especially. They wasnt just colors no more but became like ghosts of meaning floating through them pages. White meant sameness but with money behind it. Gray was sameness gone to seed.\n\nHe planted these meanings early like spring wheat. Everyone wearing white like they was all cut from the same bolt of cloth. Daisy and that Jordan girl always in white and Nick in his white flannels and Tom in his white shirt and Catherine with her face all powdered white as bone. Only time the white gives way is at Gatsby's party where the colors run wild and primitive like animals let loose from their cages.\n\nThe whiteness and the grayness they spread like a sickness. Down in them canyons of New York all white and dead. The names of party people gone gray as ash on Nick's paper. Apartment buildings stacked like slices of white bread nobody wanted. Plain folk and plain places all marked with it too. Them two girls Jordan and Daisy with their white childhood that wasnt no different from any other childhood. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fall like dirty snow. That Italian child by the tracks gray as a shadow and the old man selling dogs gray as time itself.\n\nOnce he'd loaded them colors with all that weight he turned them loose again. Used them like a man uses a knife. When Daisy comes back wearing white in her white car she aint a woman no more but just another piece of sameness Gatsby's been chasing. Like trying to catch smoke in your hands. Her fur collar gray as a morning fog and that white dress before the showdown between Tom and Gatsby. All of it marking her as something less than real. Something uniform and empty as an echo in an empty room.",
            "The land lies blessed by sun and mild days, a country where men have wrought sustenance from soil since time out of mind. Here the earth gives forth its bounty - tomatoes swollen red as blood, citrus hanging like small suns, the green leaves of lettuce spread like hands reaching skyward. Squash and broccoli and herbs. The peach trees and the lemon trees. The berries dark as night. The bees making their sweet gold. And the peppers that burn like fire in the mouth.\n\nThey call it San Diego County and here the people hunger for clean food, food grown without poison, waiting in long lines to claim their share. They come for eggs still warm from the nest and milk sweet from the udder. They walk the land where their food is born, watching birds wheel overhead and treading paths worn by countless feet before them.\n\nThe land speaks of older things. One hundred sixty acres pressed against the Cleveland Forest like a child to its mother's breast. Chaparral and grassland brought by ships from across the sea, oak trees that were saplings when the first white men came. Before them the Indians walked here, numberless generations leaving nothing but flakes of stone and shards of pottery to mark their passing. Then came the cattlemen and the woodcutters, their descendants still working the land that great-grandfathers claimed with paper and ink and the sweat of their brows.\n\nHere now the farmers work without chemicals, their hands callused and backs bent, fighting weeds and insects as old as time. The cost is dear - more work, more loss, more struggle against the ancient enemies of those who till the soil. But the land remembers. Where poison once flowed now butterflies dance and birds sing. The kangaroo rat, small as a child's fist, makes its home in burrows beneath the earth. The yellow-legged frog still leaves its spawn in clear waters. The gnatcatcher flits through branches like a ghost.\n\nThey have programs now, men in offices who would help preserve these things. They offer money and knowledge, as if such things could capture the essence of this place where the wild and tame meet like old friends across a fence.",

Love and hate and pride dwelling there like ancient creatures in some lightless deep. Brothers know each other in ways that others cannot know, seeing in the other's face a mirror of their own soul, raw and unvarnished in the harsh light of truth. When darkness comes it comes swift and merciless, and in that darkness the true nature of brotherhood reveals itself like some terrible dawn.\n\nThey was two brothers in this tale. One strong and one weak, moving through a world painted in colors of decay and redemption. The weak one they called Doodle, born with a heart that fluttered like a dying bird in his chest. The strong one, he wanted what brothers want - someone to race against the wind, to climb the twisted vines that hung like hanged men in Old Woman Swamp, to sit high in the pine trees where the air runs thin and watch the world below turn to shadow.\n\nPride is a poison that works slow but sure. The older brother carried it in him like a serpent coiled round his heart. He looked at Doodle and saw all the things that could never be, all the dreams that died stillborn. There was nights he stood over the child with a pillow in his hands, death hovering in the room like smoke. But then the baby smiled and something broke inside him, some dark thing washed away by a love he didn't know he carried. That smile was like God striking a match in the darkness of his soul.\n\nThe land stretched out before them green and wild, indifferent to their struggles. Through it they moved like pilgrims seeking something they couldn't name, the older brother driving them both toward some terrible reckoning. Pride and love wrestled in his heart like Jacob with the angel, but pride is a hard master and takes no prisoners. In the end only one brother would walk away from that green cathedral, carrying with him the weight of all that was and all that could have been.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and labyrinthine thing, wrought with complexities that defy the simplest notions of understanding. Through the long years of our knowing, we have sought to capture its essence in metaphor, like trying to trap shadows in a box. First came the tablets of wax, then the papyrus leaves yellowed with age, then bound pages, and now in these modern times we speak of circuits and silicon, though none of these tell the whole truth of it.\n\nThe way of knowing begins in the flesh itself, where the world's raw touch becomes something else entirely, transformed like bread into sustenance, like light into seeing. These signals course through the corridors of the brain like refugees fleeing some nameless war, moving both upward and downward through the neural wilderness. When a man looks upon a black box against white, his mind assembles it piece by piece, like a carpenter building a coffin - first the edges, then the shadows, then the whole dark shape of it. The mind knows what it knows before it knows it knows, reaching down through layers of knowing to grasp at understanding.\n\nThere exists a filter in the mind, ancient as stone, that sorts what matters from what does not. A man walking across grass need not count each blade, though each blade sends its message upward through his boots and into his brain. Yet his own name spoken in a crowd will reach his ears like a gunshot across still water. The mind keeps its own counsel on what to heed and what to discard.\n\nMemory is not one thing but many, like a house with many rooms, each holding different treasures. Some memories pass like smoke, others linger like rust on iron. Words themselves are stored in different ways - their shape, their sound, their meaning - each aspect laid down in the brain's dark matter like layers of sediment in ancient rock. Some memories circle like wolves in the mind for twenty seconds before vanishing, while others embed themselves in the very protein of being, becoming part of the flesh itself.\n\nMen have made maps of knowledge in the brain, drawing borders and connections like surveyors of an unexplored country.

The jobless walked the streets in growing numbers and houses stood empty like the bleached bones of dead things in the sun. The great towers of commerce that had stood like monuments to man's industry now wavered and some fell entirely.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been sown in years prior. In the time of Clinton when men in suits spoke of prosperity eternal and the common man's right to own his patch of earth.

Words that meant nothing to the common man but would come to mean everything. They built their tower of debt higher and higher until it scraped the very heavens, never thinking that such towers must someday fall.\n\nAnd fall they did. In the year 2007 the great houses of finance - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, names that had once seemed eternal as mountains - began to crumble. Four trillion in debts, a number so vast it ceased to have meaning. Like watching a great fire consume everything in its path.

No friend at all.\n\nShow dont tell, they say. Ancient wisdom passed down through the ages like scripture. But even the wisest among us fall prey to the darkness of endless words.

They marked him Hispanic like a brand, though what that meant in the vast arithmetic of justice wasn't clear.\n\nAll these stories scrolled past like scenes from some greater apocalyptic narrative, each one a testament to the violence and prejudice that runs through the world like poison in the groundwater.",
            "They called them ETFs. Securities that moved like shadows across the electronic plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets like some dark harbinger of wealth or ruin. They traded like stocks but carried within them a multitude, a diversification that men sought after like water in the desert. A man could buy one share or sell short or leverage his position with borrowed money, all while paying less than what the mutual fund lords demanded for their services.\n\nYet there were costs. Always costs. Commissions that must be paid like blood tribute to the brokers who facilitated such trades. But the variety was vast, stretching across markets like an endless prairie of financial instruments, each promising its own salvation.\n\nWe set out to study one such beast, the IHF, to determine if its promise of diversification was truth or mere illusion cast upon the screens of traders. We would compare it against its ten largest holdings, those stocks that made up nearly two-thirds of its being, to see if a man might do better to hold them separate rather than bound together in this modern financial construct.\n\nThe mathematics of it was brutal and cold. We took only the top ten holdings, for to include all would be to venture into madness. These ten represented 63.58 percent of the whole, like the strongest warriors in an army of many.\n\nThe calculations spread before us like entrails, telling their own truth. Returns and betas laid bare on paper, showing that these ten stocks alone might yield more bounty than their collective form, with less risk coursing through their veins. The difference stood at 6.11 percent, no small matter in a world where men killed for less.\n\nBut numbers can lie, or at least mislead, like mirages in the financial desert. We needed more. We needed to know if these differences were real or merely phantoms dancing in the statistical light. So we dug deeper, into the standard deviations of each holding, normalizing them like preparing bodies for burial, to compare them against the whole of IHF itself.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter birds shot from a cold gray sky. You could see it there in Figure 17 plain as death. The kind of fall that makes a man question everything he thought he knew. Winter had come to New England the way it always does, merciless and raw, and the bicycles that once crowded the racks stood abandoned like the bones of prehistoric beasts. The people who'd walked now drove. Who could blame them. December brought with it the end of things, the way December always does. Papers needed grading and the holidays loomed like specters and the students scattered to the four winds, carrying with them whatever enthusiasm they'd had for our little crusade.\n\nThey came back in January but the fire was gone. February was worse. Maybe that's just the way of things in this world. The bright flame burns quick and hot then gutters out leaving nothing but ash and memory. We tried to rekindle it come March with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate gambit that worked after its fashion, though nothing burns quite the same the second time around.\n\nBut there was something deeper at work, something woven into the fabric of who we are as a people. The car is freedom. The car is power. The car is America herself, and who were we to try to break that covenant. We offered what bribes we could - gift cards for coffee and books and food, the small indulgences that make life bearable. But perhaps we should have thought bigger. A bicycle maybe. A hybrid car gleaming in the sun. An electric vehicle humming with promise. The sort of prize that makes a man's eyes go wide and his heart beat faster. Maybe then they would have stayed with us through the dark months. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen like they did, like dead leaves in autumn, like hope in winter.\n\nWe could have built it up slow, like a fire you mean to last the night. Start with the small things, then the bicycles, then finally the car itself, a beacon drawing them back to us. But we didn't. We stayed our course and watched the numbers fall and now we know better. Now we know what it takes to fight against the current of human nature, to swim upstream against the river of American dreams.",
            "They were there in the darkness of the archives, those ancient reels of celluloid, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, each bearing Edison's mark. Magic boxes containing illusions wrought not by God but by man's own devilry with the machine. I watched them all, every flickering frame, studying their nature like some pilgrim seeking truth in sacred texts.\n\nThese phantoms danced upon the screen bound by rules older than the medium itself. They moved in their fixed space like creatures caught between worlds, trapped in a proscenium arch that served as both window and prison. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, capturing figures that dared not approach it, as if held back by some invisible force that commanded their sideways dance.\n\nTake that tale they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the last year of the old century. Josh and his kind moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal track, entering stage right like players in some mechanical theatre, never daring to breach the invisible wall between their world and ours. The camera watched, patient and merciless in its fixed gaze.\n\nThese moving pictures bore the bloodline of the theatre, that ancient art that kept its performers at arms length from those who watched. No face ever loomed large upon the screen, no eye ever pierced the veil between player and viewer. They kept their distance, these ghosts of light, performing their tricks in long shot or medium frame, never closer, never intimate.\n\nMost curious was how these mechanical dreams confined themselves to single breaths, one shot containing all there was to tell, rarely stretching beyond sixty seconds of life. Yet even in this brevity there lay deception. What appeared whole was oftentimes stitched together from separate pieces, like a corpse reassembled for viewing. The Execution of Mary showed this truth plain enough - watch close and you'll see where they cut more than just the queen's head, splicing reality itself to serve their illusion.\n\nThese were our first lies told in light, our first attempts to make the impossible real through the sorcery of the machine. And like all lies, they held their own peculiar truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both old and new, a thing that carries within it the seeds of its own contradiction. Like some ancient tomb unearthed in modern soil it bears the weight of ages past while speaking to those who would dig it up anew. Ian Watt called it what it was. An oxymoron. Old-New. And men have praised it and damned it in equal measure, some saying it held no depth while others spoke of Burke's terrible sublime like preachers speaking of divine revelation.\n\nWhen Horace Walpole birthed the first true Gothic tale in The Castle of Otranto he didnt know what dark thing he had loosed upon the world. He took the ancient ways of romance and wedded them to something modern and in doing so created a bastard child that would outlive its father. The theatrical elements of old merged with what men called the mimicry of nature and from this union came what Walpole himself named A Gothic Story. The word gothic itself had been worn smooth by time and use, passed through countless mouths to describe peoples and buildings and times long dead. Some saw it as primitive. Backward. A thing best left in the past while society marched ever forward into what they called progress. But the marriage of theatrical gothic elements with the psychological intimacy of the novel created something that refused to die, that was somehow both ancient and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe ghost of chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that cannot rest. In Otranto the medieval notions of knightly virtue are both preserved and transformed, like a body that has been both mummified and mutilated. Walpole and his kind clung to these ideals of the brave and honorable knight precisely because such men had vanished from the world, if they had ever truly existed at all. The gothic past became a dream of something better, a time when men knew honor and duty and did not shy from either. Walpole wrote in dark times, when politics had grown foul and accusations flew like carrion birds. Perhaps he thought that something fundamental had been lost, some essential goodness that had once lived in men's hearts but had withered and died in the modern world. We see this most clearly in Frederic, a character who carries the weight of chivalric virtue like a crown of thorns. He comes to us first in description, a prince who has known suffering, who has walked away from tragedy, who men believe fell fighting the infidel. The gallant and courteous Knight exists in these pages as something larger than life, excessive in his virtue as all things in Gothic tales must be excessive.",
            "Supply chain it moves like a river through the land of commerce. Raw materials to finished goods flowing ever onward to the waiting hands of customers who know not from whence it came. In 1982 a man called Oliver gave name to this thing that had existed nameless since the first trader walked the first road with the first goods. He called it supply chain management and in doing so he captured the essence of planning and control and implementation that feeds the hunger of want.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Like ancient gods they stand watch over the flow of goods, and the men who tend to business bow before them seeking favor in the marketplace.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone laid deep in the bedrock of enterprise. It asks the questions that must be answered. When. Why. Where. How. The managers peer into the great void of the marketplace like seers reading entrails, seeking signs of what the people want. The market speaks in whispers of demand and they must listen close to hear its truth. Then they must decide what will be born into the world and in what numbers and from which wombs of industry it will come forth.\n\nI knew this truth when I worked the floors of Walmart and Target both. There was a scripture for everything. How to dress. How to move. How to receive the great trucks that came like metal beasts in the night bearing their cargo. Everything written down in books like industrial bibles telling all who would read them the proper way of things.\n\nSupply comes next in the procession. It speaks of capabilities and partnerships and the breaking of whole things into parts. Managers must look upon their domains and know which pieces fit where like some great industrial puzzle. Sometimes they must reach out beyond their walls to other makers and other doers, seeking that thing called velocity. Velocity that promises quality and flexibility while keeping the coin in the purse, though few who seek it truly find it.",
            "They were books of another time. Victorian they called them. All manner and detail laid out like bones in the desert sun, bleached white with aristocratic concern and societal affairs that meant nothing to the dead or dying. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart like dark sentinels in the gathering dusk, their pages filled with a mystery that crawled beneath the skin like fever dreams. They bore witness to things that proper society dared not speak of.\n\nIn one such passage the boy Oliver walks through a fevered haze. He walks with killers. With Sikes and Crackit who argue in voices that echo through his skull like gunshots in an empty church. The words come and go like wind through dead grass. Then the real shots ring out and the night explodes in fire and screaming and lights that dance like devil-moths against his eyes. Some force, nameless and terrible, drags him through the chaos while pain gnaws at him like a starved dog that won't let go.\n\nThese fever dreams run through both books like dark water through underground caves. In Oliver's tale they show what lies beneath, the rot and the fear and the helplessness of a child caught in the machinery of fate. When the shooting comes back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it comes like a visitation, like something holy and terrible both. The boy relives it all while his body searches for salvation it dont believe in. He's powerless. Always was. The pain aint even a surprise no more, just a companion walking beside him in the dark. The question aint about who shot him. The question is about whose will brought the boy to this place, because it sure wasnt his own. Old Fagin had worked his poison deep, wearing down the boy's spirit like water wearing down stone until there wasnt nothing left but acceptance of the dark.\n\nTime itself becomes a stranger. Day passes into night or maybe there never was a day at all. Just darkness bleeding into darkness while silence stretches out like a rope with no end.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces bent over books and papers in the late afternoon light. Most I could help well enough but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy called Adrian, might have been eight or nine, who couldn't read worth a damn. Something wasnt right with how he saw the letters. Some he knew like old friends and others may as well have been hieroglyphs scratched in ancient stone. His English was pure as mountain water but his blood was Mexican sure enough. We fought those letters like they were demons until the day his mother came.\n\nShe walked in while I was minding the stragglers left behind from some excursion. Not a word of English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish like soft bullets. My own Spanish was poor and broken but we made do with gestures and half-understood words. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer blow. Adrian could read just fine. It was our strange English letters that were foreign to him, not the words themselves. Whether that knowledge ever served him I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale because it speaks to something deeper, something that runs through the veins of our schools here in California like a dark current. The wall between languages aint always what you'd expect. Even a child who speaks English pure as springwater might stumble when the letters dance strange on the page. We all know this devil exists but the killing of it aint so simple. For Adrian the medicine was clear enough - teach him our letters, teach him our sounds. But for them that barely speak English the cure aint so clean. No single answer exists in this world or the next. Dual language learning, throwing them in the deep end, private teaching, special English classes - none of these alone will slay the beast. The truth lies in using them all like weapons in an arsenal.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching aint just for the Spanish speakers but for all our young ones. Studies show these children rise above their peers like hawks over field mice. Some folk fear it's wasteful, that most children won't gain nothing from it. That's a lie black as pitch. If we made this the way instead of the exception, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Force every teacher to speak two tongues? No, that's a fool's errand. But having them that can speak both languages helping in the classroom, that's no dream but a real possibility hard as iron.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of what mind can hold. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men in robes speak ancient words. Some take what their mothers and fathers gave them and hold it close like a blanket against the dark while others cast it away saying there aint nothing out there but what we know and what we see. And we take up these beliefs like weapons only to lay them down again for different ones when the first ones fail us. Each soul walking its own path through the spiritual dark searching for some light to lead it home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set there on the porch listening to the rain hammer the tin roof while smoke from our cigarettes rose up in pale wisps to join the clouds. Water poured from the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew there, petals beaten flat against the mud. He looked out into the gray distance with eyes that seemed to see both now and then at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's and his head showed pale through thinning hair. He wouldnt look at me. I knew I could not speak of what was coming for speaking makes real what we wish was not. I moved closer and hugged him and we sat there watching the June rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their predictions but what good was breath when it only meant more pain. What sort of god would craft such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers for if there was a god he had turned his face from me long ago.\n\nI would not watch him die. Could not. The life that gave me life deserved better than my witness to its ending. I knew him better than they did. Better than the blood kin that gathered round his bed. He would not want his child to watch death take him. So I lay curled in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline county and knew the soil like his own blood. John Taylor. Man of the earth and of words both. The land spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in that capacity too and the marriage of these things made him what he was. A voice crying out against the wilderness of government overreach. Against the darkness that men brought forth when they strayed from honest work.\n\nThe republic stood newborn on the continent like some vast experiment in human nature. No ancient ghosts to bind it. No old world chains to wear. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. The chance to build something true. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever power ruled the hearts of men were like bones in a skeleton. Break one and the whole thing goes wrong. Goes twisted. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government that would call itself just.\n\nIn the raw state of nature the strong preyed upon the weak and the clever preyed upon both but Taylor believed civilization must rise above such base instincts. Must find a way to account for the light and dark that dwelled in every human heart. Good and evil. No middle ground between them. He wrote that government carried all the virtues and vices of the men who wielded it, like a sword that could heal or harm depending on whose hand held the hilt.\n\nThe principles he called good were simple things. Protection of what a man owned. The enhancement of agriculture. The restraint of those who would profit from paper and promises rather than honest work. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but like fire it could warm a home or burn it down. Government must contain this force, must channel it, must be watched always lest it turn from servant to master.\n\nHe stood with others who read the Constitution like scripture, demanding every word be weighed and measured. The federal government must be bound tight, he said, kept small, kept lean, kept honest. A bloated government would turn tyrant as surely as meat turns rotten in summer heat. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be known, must be held sacred. The Declaration that came before was truer still, he thought. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation. Separate fires burning bright against the dark.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was done. The mind worked at it like some machine spinning in emptiness, taking in what lay before it and letting go again without holding to any truth or knowing. Thoughts came and went like smoke in a wind. No thought stayed.\n\nHe'd bought him a book once. Some woman artist had told him of it. About drawing and the mind and how these things worked together or didnt work together and how a man might learn to see what was before him truly and not just what his mind told him ought to be there. The book spoke of frames. How putting a frame around a thing made it something else entirely. How a kitchen full of things became just a bowl of fruit on a table if you framed it right.\n\nStanding there he couldnt frame nothing. The sight was too big for frames. Like them painters of old had their colors. Blues and greens and all the colors of God's earth. If he was to paint this scene it would be brown. Nothing but brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it. The muscles worked beneath the skin like creatures with their own purpose. Water moved in its ancient circles. Clear as light itself. Things broke apart in it and vanished. He worked the handle again. Faster now. Urgent. The brown mass stayed fixed like something alive and willful. Like it had made up its mind to stay.\n\nHe stood there in his tie that choked at his throat. Green like poison. Feet planted like a man about to receive news of death. The mop loose in his grip like a broken standard. Some previous visitor had left this offering. This message to them that cleaned the drugstore toilets. He flushed again and again and watched the water move and settle and move again. Then his hand went to the paper. Wrapping and wrapping until the hand was white as bone. He bent at the waist like a man in prayer. The hand went down into the water like something seeking baptism in darkness...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things but they dont need to tell what any fool can see with his own eyes. Inexperience sits heavy in their bones and death rides shotgun in their fathers pickup trucks.\n\nThe children gather like crows. Two then three then four in a car and the metal beast beneath them growls with promise and threat both. Studies done in California show what we already know in our hearts - that death multiplies with each young soul added to the cabin. Some states try to hold back the tide with their paper laws and provisional permits but its like trying to dam a river with chicken wire.\n\nZuckerman the headshrinker says eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of speed like junkies seek the needle and they cant help themselves no more than a rattler can help its poison. The boomers babies are coming he says. Coming like a flood to wash our roads in blood and metal and grief.\n\nThe answer lies simple as a coffin nail. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let them learn in classrooms and parking lots with teachers watching careful as priests. Make it the same in every state so there aint no place for death to slip through the cracks. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty with a grown soul watching. Numbers writ in law like commandments.\n\nThis aint new thinking. But then neither is death and we seem to keep finding ways to deal in that particular trade.",
            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the sounds wrong. Not in the hearing but in the knowing of what was heard. Like a radio playing through broken glass. The brain took the sounds and twisted them and made them strange and foreign though the ears worked just fine.\n\nThe disorder first showed itself in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with clinical minds sought to understand it. They worked in sterile rooms with machines and wires and children who could not parse the world of sound around them. Kimura came later with his tests of competing sounds fed into separate ears like twin serpents of noise coiling into the skull.\n\nThe affliction manifested in ways various and cruel. Some could not tell where sounds came from in the void of space as if they walked in darkness eternal. Others could not separate one sound from another or know when words meant their opposite through the tone of voice that carried them. The sounds came like waves breaking upon rocks, each one washing away the memory of the last until nothing remained but confusion.\n\nTo diagnose it they brought forth an arsenal of tests and observations like ancient priests seeking auguries in the behavior of their subjects. Audiologists and speech pathologists and psychologists all brought their tools to bear, watching and measuring and recording. They fed sounds into ears and measured the echoes that returned. But no single test could catch this ghost in the machine of the mind, and none could say from whence it came. It remained elusive as smoke, real as rain, present as pain.\n\nThey would sit children in rooms and bombard them with sounds, asking them to pluck meaning from chaos. Numbers and words would rain down like hail, and they would watch as the children struggled to catch them, to hold them, to make sense of the storm. Some could and some could not and in this way they separated the afflicted from the whole.",
            "They'd asked what I aimed to do and I told them plain. Work with the children. The broken ones. The ones cast off and forgotten like old shoes in a ditch. Them that's been touched by darkness that walks in daylight wearing the skin of kin. Values aint just words wrote down in some book. They're carved deep in the bone. Service. Respect. The old ways of right and wrong that dont bend nor break.\n\nI'd wandered some years not knowing my path. Watched folks run from their demons or drown em in whatever poison they could find. Got myself some learning in the ways of the mind at Piedmont College in 09 but still the path weren't clear. Then come a summer day I'll not forget. Boy of sixteen set on my friend's couch like a sparrow ready to fly. Eyes darting. Hands working at nothing. Running from them that should've protected him but didn't.\n\nNext day I drove out to where he come from. Talked to the law standing in that yard where evil had made its home. Told em what I knew from my schooling. They asked me to speak to the parents and I did. Watched em squirm and lie, calling their boy's cry for help manipulation. Simple disputes, they said. Nothing simple about it. That's when I knew what I had to do.\n\nJustice aint just a word neither. Society talks about the worth of one soul while trying to make every soul look the same. I never did hold with that. Through them school years I made my stand. Wore my colors like war paint. Put metal in my flesh where I pleased. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Fought the old poisons of hate and fear wherever they showed their face. Some folks say protest aint proper. I say there aint nothing more proper than standing against what's wrong.\n\nThat's the truth of it. Plain as I can tell it.",
            "The night comes and with it the darkness that some cannot escape into sleep. There are those who walk among us bearing the curse of wakefulness, their minds racing like wild horses across the vast plains of consciousness while others find peace in the void. They call it insomnia but names mean little to those who suffer its relentless grip.\n\nThe men of science speak of two paths to understanding this affliction. One path leads through blood and bone, through the twisted helixes of our making that we inherit from those who came before. The other winds through the territories of man's own making - the streets and alleys of culture, the borderlands of race and wealth, the dark canyons between rich and poor.\n\nIn the laboratories they keep their mice in plastic boxes, watching as the creatures struggle between wake and sleep. The scientists speak of things called GABAB receptors, tiny gatekeepers in the hypothalamus that stand watch over the kingdom of sleep. They inject their potions - baclofen they call it - and observe as the mice surrender to unconsciousness. As if mice could tell us the secrets of human suffering.\n\nThey mapped these territories of sleep like ancient cartographers, drawing borders between what they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, primary disorders and secondary ones. Names upon names, categories within categories, as if naming a thing could capture its essence. Nightmare Disorder. Sleep Terror. Sleepwalking. Words that try to cage the uncageable.\n\nIn the end it all comes down to the firing of neurons in the dark meat of our brains, the dance of chemicals across synaptic gaps, the inheritance of cursed genes passed down like dark heirlooms through generations. And those who cannot sleep walk among us like ghosts, haunting fluorescent-lit offices and sterile classrooms, their eyes heavy with the weight of endless days.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The campus stretches vast and merciless, a concrete expanse that swallows souls and time alike. In my first year they put me in East Halls, far out where the morning sun first touches university soil, beyond where most students dare venture save for football and spectacle.\n\nThe path from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage. Twenty-five minutes through rain or snow or whatever god saw fit to cast down upon us. The old ones speak of times when East stood alone, islands of brick and mortar in seas of empty land. Now steel and glass rise where emptiness once dwelled. The Creamery. The healing house. Apartments like teeth in a giant's mouth surrounding it all. The campus grows like some living thing, consuming space, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nWhat salvation exists for those who must traverse these spaces? The bicycle stands alone. Simple machine. Two wheels and frame and chain. But it aint enough to have the machine. You need the riders and you need the paths that welcome them.\n\nI knew a man who returned to the wheel after years away. Said he couldn't reckon why he ever stopped. Called it the only true way to move through this world. A bowl of morning grain can power you thirty miles or more, he said, and I reckon he spoke true.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bike was wisdom purchased cheap. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes by foot from my door, but the wheels cut it to five if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but aint always friendly to those who'd ride it. Walking has its merits but time is precious as blood in this place. Without the bike I'd lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day to walking. Two and a half hours every week vanished like morning mist. Add the other wanderings required of a student's life and time becomes a currency you cant afford to spend.",
            "He saw the machines coming and knew their masters well. The World Controllers and their ilk. They had built their glass towers and concrete hives where men moved like insects, each to their own predetermined place in the great mechanism of society. The conditioning began at birth, perhaps before. No man could say. They called it community but it was a prison of the soul.\n\nThe people walked through their lives like sleepwalkers, pursuing pleasure with the mindless determination of addicts. They knew nothing of struggle or pain or the raw truth of existence. The Controller stood above them all like some dark god, dispensing soma and satisfaction in measured doses. Marx had seen it coming. The way the powerful would bend the minds of the weak until they could no longer recognize their own chains.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. No hatred neither. Just the endless cycle of consumption and shallow gratification. The men spoke of women like they spoke of machines, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities and physical dimensions. The women traded stories of their couplings with the detached interest of cattle traders. Each class moved in its ordained circles, never questioning, never rising above their station. The Alphas and Betas, those who might have seen the truth of things, chose blindness instead. All except Bernard, who carried his doubt like a wound.\n\nThe lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, the rest - they were born to their servitude, their minds shaped before they drew first breath. Sleep-teaching had burned away any chance of rebellion or discontent. They consumed and labored and died, believing themselves blessed in their ignorance. The great machinery of capitalism ground on, feeding on their dreams, their desires, their very humanity. And above it all the Controller watched, counting his profits in the coin of human souls.",
            "Four years past I sat in a classroom where they spoke of Islam, voices rising and falling like wind through desert scrub. The question hung there like smoke: was this faith born of violence. Now in these days the question burns hotter still, a flame that won't die down. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and talking heads shifted from raw hatred to something else, something like submission. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers in the dark corners of time. They say he was a peaceful man but I know different. Know how he rode with warriors across the sands, how tribes fell before him like wheat before the scythe, how the sword and the word went hand in hand. Yet in these pages they paint him gentle as a lamb, a martyr walking soft in the world until men saw truth in his eyes and followed. Followed like sheep to water.\n\nAnd there in those pages they write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like some dark echo of another story, older and truer. As if taking the bread and fish from Christ's own hands and putting them in another's. A theft of holy things. Making mockery of sacred blood.\n\nThey tell these tales second-hand, third-hand, passed down like old coins worn smooth with handling. Each teller adding his own truth until truth itself becomes suspect. Like smoke rising from a fire you cannot see.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. Made him meek and mild when history shows his sword arm was strong and his will was iron. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca five times daily know the true face of the man they follow. Know the blood that stains the pages of their past.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he knew in his time upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind, scattered and forgotten in the wake of what men would later call Christian thought. Looking back across the wasteland of centuries we see only the long retreat from truth, each generation stepping further from the light into a darkness of their own making. Yet now in these latter days there comes a stirring, like wind across the desert floor, a wakening that cannot be stilled.\n\nThe old ones still cling to their beliefs like drowning men to driftwood, but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade. Among the faithful there rises a hunger for what was lost, a need to strip away the accretions of time like layers of dead skin until nothing remains but the raw truth of what the Nazarene brought forth from God. It may take generations, maybe centuries, but the wheel turns backward now and cannot be stopped.\n\nThis great undoing will sweep across the lands like wildfire, burning away the false doctrines that men have built, leaving only ash and truth behind. The church will endure, yes, but changed, transformed, stripped back to bone and sinew. Where once a thousand voices sang different songs there will be one voice, one truth, one way. Like rivers flowing backward to their source, all the scattered tribes of Christ will flow together again.\n\nHistory shows us such reversals. Rome that once drank Christian blood became Christ's greatest temple. This land that once bound men in chains now sees those same men's sons in seats of power. And so it will be with the faith itself, unspooling like a thread pulled from an ancient tapestry, until we stand again at the beginning.\n\nBut mark this well: the key that unlocks this door lies in seeing the Christ's words not as dead letters carved in stone but as living water, flowing with meaning beyond mere words. To understand what came after, we must first look back to what came before.\n\nIn those ancient days there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which Christianity would flow. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the foundations laid before Rome's eagles cast their shadow over Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the people were divided, split like dry wood - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew little of such things.",
            "The darkness that dwells in the heart of man aint nothing new and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Shows how the greed lives deep in the marrow of our bones and how we care nothing for them below us in the great chain of misery that binds us all. You can see it clear as death in them factory owners and managers, them lords of industry who built their empires on broken backs and spilled blood.\n\nThey built their kingdoms of steel and smoke, caring nothing for what lay crushed beneath. Sinclair wrote of how them buildings stood like black teeth against the sky, chimney stacks vomiting endless streams of smoke into the heavens, as if trying to poison God himself. The smoke rolled away toward the horizon like some great serpent, coiling and twisting until it disappeared where the earth meets the sky. The owners, they didnt care none for the poison they put into the air or the filth that ran from their slaughterhouses, rivers of blood and worse things that no man should have to name.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Disposable as the hogs they butchered. There wasnt no loyalty in that place, no decency neither. A man's worth was measured in pennies and dollars, his life cheaper than the copper in his pocket. They worked them men like mules and cast them aside just as quick, no warning, no mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with invisible blood.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown, they was caught in a web of their own making, though they didnt weave it themselves. No escape from the grinding machinery of industry that ate men whole and spit out bones. The unions that was supposed to help only fed off their misery like vultures on carrion. The foreign workers, them that came seeking the American dream, found instead an American nightmare. They hung there between life and death, survival dependent on the whims of men who was no better than the slave drivers of old. Their suffering was as certain as winter frost, their degradation as inevitable as darkness following light. And there aint no law of God or man that could save them from it.",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things dont matter now and didnt matter then. The word Thulé appeared twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, borrowed perhaps from Virgil who'd used it to name some distant shore beyond Britain where the Greeks reckoned the world fell away into darkness. But there was something else. Something closer.\n\nThe German writers had gotten into his blood. Among them was Goethe whose words Poe knew well enough that scholars like Karl J. Arndt would later trace the shadowed footprints between their works, seeing in Poe's lines an echo of the master's voice.\n\nGoethe himself was dead by then. His Faust lay in two parts like a bifurcated serpent, the first coiled in 1808 and the second dying with him in 1832. Within those pages there was a tale of a king and his dead queen and a goblet that carried both memory and grief. The king drank deep and wept deeper until at last he walked to the edge of all things and cast the cup into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into the dark. It wasnt hard to see Poe's own darkness there, his own cup of sorrow, his own dead love.\n\nThe word Thule appeared again in The Pit and the Pendulum but it was in Dream-Land where it found its true home, standing guard at beginning and end like black-robed sentries. The landscapes of both tales stretched out across the same wastes: colorless, empty, populated only by ghosts and memories that wouldnt die proper deaths but lingered like smoke in still air.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work as surely as he knew his own demons. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German and in doing so revealed his own. The words had been there all along, waiting in translations and adaptations, seeping into the soil of American letters like blood into sand.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it is darker than any book of statutes. In the failing light of an October evening in California a manager sat eating his dinner while death or something like it waited patient in the aisles of his store. The spill lay there like some primordial ooze, transparent and lethal, the crushed remains of apples processed and jarred and shipped and spilled and now forming a slick that would alter the course of lives yet unknown.\n\nThey came to him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan bearing news of the hazard but Martin would not be moved from his repast. He sat unmoved and uncaring like some petty god pronouncing judgment on the affairs of mortals beneath his notice. The store bore already the history of five who had fallen that year alone, their bodies caught in gravities cruel embrace, but such things did not trouble Martin's thoughts.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if ordained. Her back broke not with a sound but with a feeling, something ancien and terrible coursing through bone and sinew. The law speaks of conscious disregard and willful negligence but these are just words meant to cage the darkness in mens hearts. Martin knew what lay in wait in his domain. Knew it as sure as he knew the taste of the food he would not leave. Knew it as sure as he knew of those who had fallen before.\n\nThe question before the judge is one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether such calculated indifference rises to the level of malice that the law demands for special retribution. The evidence speaks clear enough. Six times the floor had claimed its tribute in that year alone. Two warnings ignored while dinner grew cold. These are not mere oversights but markers on a map leading to something darker in the soul of man. The law may speak of summary judgments but no judge would dare dismiss such darkness without letting light shine full upon it.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a thing alive. It had come upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a shadow companion through the years that followed. By seventeen it had shaped itself not into want of things but of someone, though no boy that crossed her path stirred anything in her blood. They came and went like leaves in autumn, their awkward advances scattered to wind. She studied this emptiness in herself like studying tracks in sand, theories rising and falling away like tide, none substantial enough to hold weight.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world and spoke softer still. Arguments were rare as rain in drought season, save when their daughter's wild spirit pressed against the walls of their quiet life like wind through canyon walls. She carried within her a fire that burned bright against their stillness, yet it was a warmth that drew others near, not a consuming flame.\n\nBut this day carried darkness. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed she heard her mother's cry cut through the kitchen air sharp as breaking glass. She ran. Found her mother crumpled on tile like a broken bird. Pain wrapped round her mother's words tight as barbed wire. Hospital, she managed. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering their training, and she bore her mother out like precious cargo through the door and into the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air hung thick with bleach and suffering and fear but she noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She carried her through doors that whispered open, voice rising raw for help. White-coated figures materialized like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother whole. Then she was alone with the waiting.\n\nAll this because her mother had reached too high, seeking some ceramic beauty in cabinets that touched the ceiling. The stepping stool had betrayed her like false ground giving way beneath trusted feet.",
            "The dead speak in numbers and the living count their meals. They sought truth in the eating habits of women, watching what passed their lips like priests taking count of sins. Mediterranean fare they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from fruits that grew in ancient soils. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts kept sparse upon their plates. Wine in moderation like a sacrament.\n\nThey had seen before how this way of eating kept death at bay. Studies writ in blood and paper showed how hearts beat longer, stronger when fed thus. The fat ones shed their burden easier this way than counting grams of lard and butter. But none had watched the brain and how it fails when vessels burst.\n\nThey gathered seventy-four thousand women and more, nurses all, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. For twenty years they watched them eat and die or live. Six times they made them write their testimony of meals, marking down each morsel like confessions. Most stayed true to the watching, year after year, while some vanished into the dark of time.\n\nThe counters of meals verified their methods. When death came they checked the records, the papers of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable when proof was thin, these made up less than a quarter of the fallen.\n\nThey weighed the women, noted their smoke and pills, their monthly cycles and the hormones they took. How they moved their bodies in leisure counted too. The numbers they gathered like crows collecting bright things, seeking patterns in the chaos of living.\n\nWhen the counting ended, the truth lay bare in figures cold as corpses. Two thousand hearts failed, seventeen hundred brains bled or starved, and a thousand souls departed through paths carved by broken vessels. Those who ate as the ancients did, who scored highest in their Mediterranean ways, they lived longer. The numbers spoke clear: their risk of failing hearts and minds fell by more than a quarter compared to those who ate as modern folk do.\n\nIn the end, the numbers told a story old as olive groves: how we eat marks how we die.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma the sign said. The girl stood there holding it above her head like some proclamation of doom writ in black ink against the cardboard. She was an actor in films. The kind that made people feel good about themselves.\n\nIn the east where the sun rises red over jungle and plain there is a country of ghosts. Burma they called it once. Myanmar now. Men in uniform took it like thieves in the night. They came in 1962 with guns and proclamations and they never left. The monks rose up against them wearing robes colored like dried blood. Saffron they called it. The monks walked and they prayed and the people followed them into the streets like children following the piper. At first the men with guns watched. Then they didnt. They came in the night with their boots and their rifles and broke down the doors of the monasteries. Sacred places violated by the godless. A Japanese man with a camera died on a street corner. Just another body. They said thirteen died but a soldier who ran told different. Thousands he said. Thousands of bodies. Where they buried them no one knows.\n\nIt aint nothing new. Since man first walked upright and found he could rule over others by force there have been such things. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who said they were gods themselves. Even now men who wear suits instead of crowns claim to speak for god while they deal in death.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. In China they gunned down students in a square while tanks rolled past. The government said three hundred. The truth was thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. The streets ran with blood and no one came to help. And before all that there was Hitler. He killed millions. Rounded them up like cattle. Branded them. Burned them. Made them into smoke that rose up to accuse the very heavens. And now perhaps his spirit walks in Burma where the monks once walked. Where the dead lay unnamed in unmarked graves. Where the men with guns still rule.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington ran deep through the veins of jazz like old blood through ancient stone, his years stretched long across the century and with them came power to shape sound and men alike. At the piano his touch was light as morning frost but in the writing of music he was more akin to some dark demiurge, crafting worlds of sound where men could walk free yet bound, improvising within the walls he built note by note, bar by bar. He knew these men, knew their souls and the sounds that lived in them, knew how to call forth those sounds like a conjurer of old spirits. The orchestra was his instrument and he played it like some great and terrible organ, pulling stops and pressing keys that were the very souls of men.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of Grove they speak of his Creole Love Call, how he made the human voice cry out like brass and wood, wordless and pure as desert wind. Through six circles of blues it winds, each a testament to his craft. First comes the voice against reeds like two wolves calling across valley darkness, then the muted trumpet wailing blue notes into the void. High above a clarinet keens while piano notes fall like rain beneath. The full band rises then, brass and reed locked in their eternal dance, until all culminates in a great crescendo where reeds cry out against the syncopated heartbeat of brass and rhythm. At last the voice returns, growling like some nightbound creature, before all ends in discord and darkness.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded when the moon had walked another year across the sky, he bound together the tight-wound strings of orchestration with colors drawn from the very air. Miley's trumpet called and Cox's voice answered, man and instrument trading places in some strange alchemy of sound. And when It Don't Mean a Thing rose up from silence, there was Nanton, called Tricky Sam by those who knew him, drawing forth the melody from his muted horn like an old priest reading ancient scripture, the sound of it hanging in the air like smoke from a long-dead fire.",
            "They come to ask why things change the way they do. As if the world held answers plain and true for those who'd seek them. Back in 1917 a man called Thompson spoke of how we ain't yet learned to put numbers to the shapes of living things and truth be told we ain't much further along now neither.\n\nThe shells lay there like ancient scrolls writ in a language we barely understand. They spiral through time and space like cosmic dancers frozen in calcium carbonate, each whorl telling its own tale of life and death and change. We took to studying these Prunum shells, their ghostly forms caught in X-ray light, trying to capture their essence in numbers and equations like trying to trap starlight in a jar.\n\nThe shell grows like a living cathedral, turning through the void in perfect mathematical arcs that we ain't yet got the wisdom to fully comprehend. Each revolution marks time like the rings of a tree or the layers of earth in canyon walls. The columella stands at the center like some ancient axis mundi, holding everything together while the whorls spiral out around it like a sermon on creation itself.\n\nYou can read these shells like a book if you know how. Count the whorls from where the first suture begins, marking time in quarter turns like some cosmic clock. The aperture traces its path through space leaving behind it this perfect geometric testament to life's endless variations. Each shell carries in its form the history of its kind, written in calcium and protein, waiting for them as can read such things.\n\nWe fed these measurements into machines, trying to capture in silicon and electricity what nature had wrought in lime and water over millions of years. The numbers dance across screens like prophets speaking in tongues, telling tales of what might have been and what yet could be. But the truth of it all remains elusive, like trying to catch smoke in your hands or hold back the tide with a broom.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like fallen birds in their mothers' arms, their numbers unchanging through the years, a dark testament to a nation's struggle. Ten years passed and still they died, these small ones, while men in offices spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams. They spoke of water flowing clean and proper places to shit but the children kept dying all the same and the mothers too, their blood flowing out across dirt floors in villages where no doctor ever set foot.\n\nIn the cities they had women who knew the old ways of birth, midwives they called them, their hands skilled in the catching of babies but helpless when the darkness came and the blood wouldn't stop. Seven of ten births they attended but it wasnt enough. Never enough. The diarrhea came for the young ones too and fewer hands reached out to help them now than before. After the births the mothers lay alone, no one watching for the fever or the bleeding that might take them in the night.\n\nThe knife that opens the belly to free the child, they called it cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. In the cities maybe seven women in a hundred felt its mercy but in the villages only two. The poor died easier than the rich, that's how it always was and how it remained. Twenty-seven souls in a hundred turned away from the hospital door, their pockets empty as their hopes.\n\nThey argued about it in their offices with their papers and their coffee. Some said to build special programs like towers reaching to heaven, each one targeting its own kind of death. Others wanted to strengthen what was already there, the bones and sinews of the healing places. The tower-builders talked fast about quick results but they didn't speak of how their grand designs pulled the healers away from other work, how the money flowed to one place while other needs withered like crops in drought. And everywhere the paper multiplied like leaves in autumn, forms upon forms, each program demanding its own kind of truth written in its own kind of way.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, sprouting genres like weeds in an abandoned field till no man could count them all. And within each genre - the rap and the rock and the country and all their kin - subspecies breed and multiply like dark thoughts in a fever dream.\n\nHeavy Metal, bastard child of rock, has perhaps grown most feral of all. Forty years it has roamed the musical wasteland, gathering darkness unto itself like a shroud. It feeds on emotion - raw and bleeding emotions that decent folk dont speak of. Early on the people saw how this beast could be trained, could be bred into new forms. And breed it did. New forms begat newer forms until the original creature was lost in the thundering herd of its progeny.\n\nNow the beast has so many faces that men argue what truly makes the metal what it is. It has consumed other genres, digested them, made them its own. To know the thing you must go back. Back to where it first crawled from the primordial muck of music. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal lives in darkness. It is a thing of excess - excess in all things. In volume and violence and theatrical display. Its practitioners are skilled beyond mere playing, they are technicians of chaos. And there are the drugs. Always the drugs. In the middle years of the seventies the drugs came like a flood and the music turned strange and otherworldly. Men made records that normal folk couldn't comprehend and blamed it on the chemicals coursing through their veins. The darkness in it was new. Popular music hadn't known such shadows before. Later metal drew from the old Romantics, those who knew darkness too. Even the Beatles, those clean-cut boys, succumbed. Their Helter Skelter was among the first, a response to the Stones' own darkness. They wanted to prove they could walk in those shadows too.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own dreams both in sleep and in waking. The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman struck dumb by the savage beauty of a dreamed land but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings wrought in oils and pigments. He had long sought the approval of those who deemed themselves fit to judge such things, those who spoke in hushed tones in gilded halls about what made art worthy and what did not. And in this seeking he found himself torn between two paths, each stretching out before him like roads in some dark wood. One path led to mimicry and conformity, the other to a wild independence that knew no masters.\n\nThe man himself came into this world on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town that squatted in the northwestern reaches of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware, living well enough by the standards of those days. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls for the state, a gabelou they called him though some named him douanier which was not right but stuck to him all the same. His first wife Clémence passed into whatever darkness awaits us all, following eight babes who never drew breath long enough to know the world. Only Julia remained, his daughter, while grief sat heavy upon him like some ancient stone. He turned to painting then as a man turns to water in the desert, seeking salvation in the sweep of brush against canvas.\n\nUnlike the others who painted in those days, men who made the peasants into something fine and noble in their pictures, Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common men dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, men like Matisse who had learned their craft in proper schools and whose names carried weight in the salons where such things mattered. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to paint so well and true that the Artiste Français would welcome him into their ranks. But such things were not to be, not then, not in the way he hoped.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road and maybe they do. The great minds spoke of it and wrote of it in their books and papers yellowed now with age, their words fading like the memories of dead men. Keats knew it when he wrote of that old urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty back to truth in some eternal dance that none could parse nor need to.\n\nWe learn what we know from books and life and pain but these things, these twin spirits of right and beautiful, they come to us like night comes to the desert. No teacher showed us how. No mother pointed to a sunset and said here child this is beauty mark it well. We know it in our bones like ancient things know the earth.\n\nYou can write about why something's right or wrong or beautiful or damned but the words just scatter like birds from a field when the truth of it comes round. Take that painting of the woman with the smile. Men have spent lifetimes talking about shadow and light and what lies behind those eyes but none of it tells you why it catches in your throat when you stand before it. There's something else there. Something that won't be caught in words no matter how fine the net we weave.\n\nO'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to tell some truths and even then the telling wasn't complete. Like trying to describe the taste of water to a man who's never drunk. Wittgenstein too, though he used bigger words to say the same thing. That ethics lives somewhere beyond where words can reach.\n\nAnd there's the heart of it. The moral and the beautiful, they live in that space between what we can say and what we can know. Like old ghosts that we can feel but never touch. That's why books carry such weight with us. They're not just words on pages but mirrors of the soul, showing us what's right and wrong in ways we can't explain but know deep in that place where knowing starts. They carry values like a river carries water, flowing through us, shaping us, but never quite letting us hold them still enough to study.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, its borders drawn in blood and stone from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the cold gray waters of Kiel where the Baltic laps at shores old as memory itself. This land speaks with one voice, though its tongue differs from the Rhine-blessed Köln through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe cuts its path like a steel thread through time. That such a place should birth itself from many wombs seems ordained, written in the very soil that bore the tribes of old.\n\nIn the time before time Germania lay vast and dark, its name a whispered thing that scholars still war over like ravens fighting for carrion. Tacitus, that Roman chronicler of blood and conquest, spoke of the Tungrians who bore the name German before crossing the Rhine to wage their war against the Gauls. Caesar too marked these people in his accounts, dipping his pen in both ink and blood to tell of the Germanic hordes that crossed the great river with malice in their hearts. He borrowed their name from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd broken from those who still stood free beyond his reach. Some say the word meant neighbor in that ancient speech, while others claim it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, or maybe it came from Irish words meaning to cry out, as if the very name could capture the battle-howls of a people who knew nothing but war.\n\nTacitus wrote of them again in his Germania, claiming them pure as winter snow, untouched by foreign blood or strange customs. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern lands for this raw country where the sky itself seemed to wage war on those below? What man would choose such a place unless it was already burned into his bones?\n\nAnd Rome, that great devourer of lands and men, sent its legions north but never truly claimed these forests and marshlands as their own. They came for amber and iron, for slaves and glory, but always they returned south, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices. These people dwelt in the shadow of empire, trading goods torn from the earth and the strength of their sword arms in service to Rome's eagles, but they remained their own masters, waiting in the dark forests for their time to come.",
            "The shadows of deception run deep in Twelfth Night where masks and falsehoods serve their purpose until they don't and a soul must cast off its borrowed skin lest it be forever lost in the dark corridors of its own making. There aint no easy way back from such deceptions neither. A body finds itself cast out standing alone in the cold world of truth having to choose between keeping what's left of their own self or holding onto them that's around them. Some folk take kindly to learning they been fooled while others carry that betrayal like a wound that won't heal.\n\nWhen it comes to them that choose to wear the clothes of the opposite sex the matter gets darker still. The question that haunts like a ghost in an empty room is why. Why does a person turn their back on what God gave them to take up false dress. With Viola we know. She speaks it plain: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang there like a confession.\n\nBeing cast upon strange shores Viola done what she had to do to keep breathing in a world that would sooner see her dead. Her deception worked right enough but it cut her off from her own kind leaving her to walk alone among women who couldn't know her true self. And then there's Olivia who looks at her with eyes full of love meant for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The weight of it all bears down harder still when Orsino speaks words that cut like knives: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThem that read this tale now might see something different in it. Might see how lies can sometimes dig up truths that were buried deep. Olivia and Orsino both carry something inside them that Viola's presence forces into the light. Whether Olivia loves Cesario cause she sees a man or cause something else stirs in her blood aint clear but Shakespeare seems to be mocking them that judge only by what their eyes tell them.\n\nYou can see it plain when Olivia turns her love from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a prairie fire jumping track and starts calling Viola sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words fall final like stones in still water.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across African plains. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names that echoed like hollow bells in the void of their extinction. But empires aint never been simple things to reckon with and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, each claw marking the soil different from the last.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Black faces bent over books in the harsh light, words swimming before their eyes like strange fish in deeper waters. The British came in 1919 and found what the Germans had built there. Schools standing like sentinels in the dust. But south and west it was different. There the missionaries walked alone among the people, government coin scarce in their pockets while white children sat in proper schools built with proper means.\n\nThe land there was different too. Not the killing heat of other territories but something more temperate, more forgiving to European blood. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand, these pale riders in a foreign land. More than anywhere else in that scattered empire. They built their world there atop the old one, like layers of sediment pressing down through time.\n\nThe books tell it different ways. German words stacked in neat rows speaking of systems and methods, of civilizing missions in distant lands. Later came the English writers, comparing one piece of earth against another, measuring success in literacy rates and school attendance like counting cattle at auction. Cohen wrote of it too, saying the whites who settled there shaped everything that came after, their presence heavy as lead in the African soil.\n\nBut the truth of it was simpler and harder both. In some places knowledge flowed like water and in others it dried up in the sun, leaving nothing but bare earth and forgotten promises. That was the way of empires. That was the way of men.",
            "They stood there at the border, these two nations, like ancient enemies carved from the same stone. From 1836 to 1893 they warred and watched each other across that line drawn in blood and dust. Fifty-seven years. The war came in 46 and when it was done Mexico lay bleeding and the victor claimed Texas and all the southwest territories like a great carrion bird picking clean the bones of the defeated.\n\nThey fought as men have always fought, for land and pride and the old hatreds that sleep in the hearts of nations. The Americans and the Mexicans carried within them the seeds of their discord - religion, culture, the weight of history itself pressing down upon them like a stone. As it has always been with nations that share borders, that invisible line drawn across the earth became a wound that would not heal.\n\nIn those times the Americans feared what lay south as they had once feared the old specters of their colonial past - Catholicism, monarchy, the Spanish crown that had ruled these lands before them. Like their cold war with the Soviets that would come later, though this was different. This was older. This was blood.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those fifty-seven years. Bandits and raiders crossed that line drawn in sand, ghosting across the desert night to strike at border towns. Both sides sent soldiers to guard that boundary but still the blood flowed. The raids continued until both nations brought their armies to bear, two giants facing each other across the void.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor, like a wounded animal learning to trust the hand that once struck it. The American hunger changed too, from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred faded like tracks in the desert sand, but the memory remained, etched in the bones of both lands.",
            "The sickness came without warning like some dark rider in the night. Fifteen years past now. I was a nurse then, having chose that path not from want but from need, the kind that grows deep in your bones when you've known nothing but want as a child. They'd say you'll never want for work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing arts instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone in the world save for what little I earned and now even that was gone. Fifteen years lived on government mercy and everything I ever called mine has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and pride. Nothing certain now cept uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: without the charity of blood kin and them few true friends I'd have been dead or worse. When calamity comes it strips a body of all pretense of strength.\n\nAin't no man can outrun disaster forever. No matter how you fortify against it some things just too big for one soul to weather alone. The government basket's got holes and the bottom's bout to give way but I'd sooner see Americans learning to trust their neighbor again than watch em all dig separate holes in the ground like scared rabbits.\n\nThey talk bout rugged individualism like it was some kind of gospel truth but what kept our ancestors breathing weren't going it alone. It was breaking bread together and sharing what little they had. Them wagon trains that crossed the mountains didn't make it on account of lone wolves but because they moved as one.\n\nSo yeah, keep your disaster kit. Your pure water tablets and window tape and matches that'll light in a flood. Stack your canned goods high if you got the space. Plant your garden if the good Lord gave you dirt to plant in. But while you're doing all that surviving, might want to learn your neighbor's name. Cause when the real trouble comes, and it will come, ain't no man an island worth living on.",
            "In the old world, before the time of iron and steel and the great machines that would come to rule the earth, there was born a prince. He who would later be known as Buddha. The ancient scrolls speak of his coming in the fifth or sixth century before the Christ child and how he cast aside the riches of his station to wander the dusty roads of existence until enlightenment found him like a thief in the night. His words spread like wildfire through the dry grass of men's souls and from these words came Buddhism, its oldest and most pure form being what men call Theravada.\n\nTwenty five hundred years have passed since then. The religion stands transformed like a tree that has weathered countless storms, its branches twisted by time and circumstance. In Sri Lanka they still perform the water-cutting ceremony, though Buddha himself never spoke of such things. Monks in saffron robes and common folk alike gather at the waters edge, their faces reflecting in the dark surface like ancient memories. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the very marrow of what the religion means and what it promises to those who follow its path.\n\nThe changes came from within and without, like wounds that both fester and heal. Some brought by those who walked the path and some by those who stood against it. Some meant to destroy and others changed things without meaning to, like a child who breaks a pottery vessel while reaching for water.\n\nThese forces that shaped the faith came in pairs like dark riders on the horizon. Internal and external. One born of the faithful, be they monk or layman, and one from those who stood outside the walls of belief. Some came with knives drawn and hatred in their hearts, seeking to cut down what Buddha had built. Others came without malice, changing things by their mere presence like wind shapes stone. All these forces moved through the world like spirits, leaving their mark on the faith that Buddha left behind.\n\nThe heart of it beats still. The triple gem they call it: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma holds the ancient words in three vessels - the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its laws, and the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of all things. They speak of Anatta - the absence of soul, of Dukkha - the suffering that walks with all living things, and of Anicca - how nothing endures. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the great wheel of death and rebirth that turns like a millstone grinding souls to dust. When the wheel stops, so too do the three poisons: desire that burns like fever, hatred cold as stone, and delusion that clouds the mind like river mist."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "He'd read it there in the old book, written in ink now faded and brown upon pages thin as onionskin. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. Words from Psalm fourteen and again in the writings of Anselm, that old saint who'd wrestled with the very notion of divine existence like Jacob with his angel in the dark. And after him came Thomas, called Aquinas, both men seeking to pin down with words what could not be captured by mere language alone.\n\nThey were hunters of the same prey, these two, though their methods differed as night from day.

His argument ran thus: that God exists in the mind and therefore must exist in truth, for how can the mind conceive of that which cannot be? A circular path perhaps, like a dog chasing its tail, yet not without its own strange logic. Faith seeking understanding, he called it. As if understanding itself was a creature that could be hunted down and caught.\n\nBut Thomas would have none of this inner searching. He was a man of the world, of stone and flesh and bone. His God left tracks in the physical world, footprints that any man with eyes could follow. Five trails he mapped out: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and the great dance of creation itself. Like a man finding a dead fire and knowing by the ash and coal that someone had been there before him. No faith required, he said. Just eyes to see and a mind to reason.\n\nThey were both right and both wrong, these ancient hunters of truth.

Then came the cattlemen and the woodcutters, their descendants still working the land that great-grandfathers claimed with paper and ink and the sweat of their brows.\n\nHere now the farmers work without chemicals, their hands callused and backs bent, fighting weeds and insects as old as time. The cost is dear - more work, more loss, more struggle against the ancient enemies of those who till the soil. But the land remembers. Where poison once flowed now butterflies dance and birds sing. The kangaroo rat, small as a child's fist, makes its home in burrows beneath the earth. The yellow-legged frog still leaves its spawn in clear waters. The gnatcatcher flits through branches like a ghost.\n\nThey have programs now, men in offices who would help preserve these things. They offer money and knowledge, as if such things could capture the essence of this place where the wild and tame meet like old friends across a fence.",
            "Blood runs thick between brothers. Runs like dark water through the veins of time itself, carrying with it all manner of things both sacred and profane. Love and hate and pride dwelling there like ancient creatures in some lightless deep. Brothers know each other in ways that others cannot know, seeing in the other's face a mirror of their own soul, raw and unvarnished in the harsh light of truth. When darkness comes it comes swift and merciless, and in that darkness the true nature of brotherhood reveals itself like some terrible dawn.\n\nThey was two brothers in this tale. One strong and one weak, moving through a world painted in colors of decay and redemption. The weak one they called Doodle, born with a heart that fluttered like a dying bird in his chest. The strong one, he wanted what brothers want - someone to race against the wind, to climb the twisted vines that hung like hanged men in Old Woman Swamp, to sit high in the pine trees where the air runs thin and watch the world below turn to shadow.\n\nPride is a poison that works slow but sure. The older brother carried it in him like a serpent coiled round his heart. He looked at Doodle and saw all the things that could never be, all the dreams that died stillborn. There was nights he stood over the child with a pillow in his hands, death hovering in the room like smoke. But then the baby smiled and something broke inside him, some dark thing washed away by a love he didn't know he carried. That smile was like God striking a match in the darkness of his soul.\n\nThe land stretched out before them green and wild, indifferent to their struggles. Through it they moved like pilgrims seeking something they couldn't name, the older brother driving them both toward some terrible reckoning. Pride and love wrestled in his heart like Jacob with the angel, but pride is a hard master and takes no prisoners. In the end only one brother would walk away from that green cathedral, carrying with him the weight of all that was and all that could have been.",
            "The mind of man is a dark and labyrinthine thing, wrought with complexities that defy the simplest notions of understanding. Through the long years of our knowing, we have sought to capture its essence in metaphor, like trying to trap shadows in a box. First came the tablets of wax, then the papyrus leaves yellowed with age, then bound pages, and now in these modern times we speak of circuits and silicon, though none of these tell the whole truth of it.\n\nThe way of knowing begins in the flesh itself, where the world's raw touch becomes something else entirely, transformed like bread into sustenance, like light into seeing. These signals course through the corridors of the brain like refugees fleeing some nameless war, moving both upward and downward through the neural wilderness. When a man looks upon a black box against white, his mind assembles it piece by piece, like a carpenter building a coffin - first the edges, then the shadows, then the whole dark shape of it. The mind knows what it knows before it knows it knows, reaching down through layers of knowing to grasp at understanding.\n\nThere exists a filter in the mind, ancient as stone, that sorts what matters from what does not. A man walking across grass need not count each blade, though each blade sends its message upward through his boots and into his brain. Yet his own name spoken in a crowd will reach his ears like a gunshot across still water. The mind keeps its own counsel on what to heed and what to discard.\n\nMemory is not one thing but many, like a house with many rooms, each holding different treasures. Some memories pass like smoke, others linger like rust on iron. Words themselves are stored in different ways - their shape, their sound, their meaning - each aspect laid down in the brain's dark matter like layers of sediment in ancient rock. Some memories circle like wolves in the mind for twenty seconds before vanishing, while others embed themselves in the very protein of being, becoming part of the flesh itself.\n\nMen have made maps of knowledge in the brain, drawing borders and connections like surveyors of an unexplored country. They speak of networks where ideas touch each other like strands in a spider's web - chair touching table touching wood touching tree, each connected to each in an endless chain of meaning. But these are just maps, and the territory they describe remains wild and unknowable as the desert night.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the markets fell and with them fell the dreams and hopes of a nation. Like some terrible god casting judgment upon the wicked and the righteous alike. The jobless walked the streets in growing numbers and houses stood empty like the bleached bones of dead things in the sun. The great towers of commerce that had stood like monuments to man's industry now wavered and some fell entirely.\n\nThe seeds of this devastation had been sown in years prior. In the time of Clinton when men in suits spoke of prosperity eternal and the common man's right to own his patch of earth. They fashioned strange instruments of debt and commerce, Byzantine in their complexity. Papers that promised wealth built upon wealth that was never there. Like some dark alchemy they transmuted simple homes into gold and then into ash.\n\nThe banks and the men who ran them created things they called adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing to the common man but would come to mean everything. They built their tower of debt higher and higher until it scraped the very heavens, never thinking that such towers must someday fall.\n\nAnd fall they did. In the year 2007 the great houses of finance - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, names that had once seemed eternal as mountains - began to crumble. Four trillion in debts, a number so vast it ceased to have meaning. Like watching a great fire consume everything in its path. The government men came with their papers and their promises but they could no more stop what was coming than they could stop the sun from setting. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those twin pillars of the American dream, fell into the hands of the government like wounded animals being led to shelter. But there was no shelter from what was coming. No shelter at all.",
            "The exposition comes like a thief in the night. Silent and merciless. Writers set their words loose upon the page like wild horses, proud and gleaming with sweat, but the reader sees only shadows moving across empty plains. They turn away. They curse. The doctor woman who speaks of these things has been known to rage at her screen, her voice echoing in the empty room like thunder in a canyon.\n\nNo friend is exposition. No friend at all.\n\nShow dont tell, they say. Ancient wisdom passed down through the ages like scripture. But even the wisest among us fall prey to the darkness of endless words. Words that pile up like dead leaves in autumn, choking the life from stories that might have lived. Two devils sit on the shoulders of those who write. One whispers of histories that must be told, while the other speaks of childhoods that stretch back beyond memory. Both are liars.\n\nExposition is death. It is the telling of things in simple words when the showing would suffice. In the moving pictures they call films, it comes when one man speaks to another of things they both already know, like an old mariner cursed to tell his tale again and again until judgment day.\n\nConsider the woman and the man she loved. Their meeting, their marriage, their ending. Two pages of words that tell nothing of the truth. No voice between them save for four lines shared like crumbs at a feast. The reader needs more. Needs to see how he looked at her across crowded rooms, how his hands moved when he spoke of things he loved, how she changed when he entered her world like sunlight through stained glass. Without these things the murder means nothing. Just more words on a page growing cold.\n\nA story needs meat on its bones. But writers grow weary. They rush past truth seeking shortcuts through the darkness. They say: here is a man who flew war machines, who tends to automobiles in the night hours, who married twice and spawned no children, who dreams of owning his small kingdom of gasoline and oil, who breaks his fast with eggs served on bread and sauce. But these are just words. And words without blood are dead things.",
            "The morning news came cold and stark across the screen like some prophetic vision of mankind's darker nature. First came word from Ashley where a man named Hostettler had put knife to wife, the blade rising and falling in that ancient dance of violence that men have known since time was young. His face on the screen was a mask of evil, eyes black and hollow like windows into hell itself.\n\nThen came news of the boy Buyers, just eighteen summers old, shot down in Sharon Woods where the darkness holds its own counsel. SWAT teams moved through the shadows like armored priests performing last rites, but no killer was found. The story passed quick like a ghost, as such tales often do when the dead or dying wear dark skin, while other victims, pale as morning frost, command the airwaves like royalty.\n\nA hole appeared in the sky itself, or rather in the metal bird that carried healing angels. Some fool with a twentytwo had put lead through the helicopter's skin. Five thousand dollars hung in the air like bait for someone's conscience.\n\nThe weatherman spoke of rain coming, storms building in the west like God's own artillery. Numbers rolled off his tongue - eighties, percentages, probabilities - all of it meaning nothing to the thunder that was coming.\n\nThen came the tale of the UDF store on Clime Road, where a dark man in darker clothes had come for money not his own. They spoke of his blackness like it was a sin itself, dwelling on the shade of his skin as if evil had its own color.\n\nLast was the Mexican druglord Rodriguez, condemned to three hundred months in steel and concrete. The numbers fell strange, as if years weren't enough to measure a man's punishment. They marked him Hispanic like a brand, though what that meant in the vast arithmetic of justice wasn't clear.\n\nAll these stories scrolled past like scenes from some greater apocalyptic narrative, each one a testament to the violence and prejudice that runs through the world like poison in the groundwater.",
            "They called them ETFs. Securities that moved like shadows across the electronic plains, tracking indices and commodities and baskets of assets like some dark harbinger of wealth or ruin. They traded like stocks but carried within them a multitude, a diversification that men sought after like water in the desert. A man could buy one share or sell short or leverage his position with borrowed money, all while paying less than what the mutual fund lords demanded for their services.\n\nYet there were costs. Always costs. Commissions that must be paid like blood tribute to the brokers who facilitated such trades. But the variety was vast, stretching across markets like an endless prairie of financial instruments, each promising its own salvation.\n\nWe set out to study one such beast, the IHF, to determine if its promise of diversification was truth or mere illusion cast upon the screens of traders. We would compare it against its ten largest holdings, those stocks that made up nearly two-thirds of its being, to see if a man might do better to hold them separate rather than bound together in this modern financial construct.\n\nThe mathematics of it was brutal and cold. We took only the top ten holdings, for to include all would be to venture into madness. These ten represented 63.58 percent of the whole, like the strongest warriors in an army of many.\n\nThe calculations spread before us like entrails, telling their own truth. Returns and betas laid bare on paper, showing that these ten stocks alone might yield more bounty than their collective form, with less risk coursing through their veins. The difference stood at 6.11 percent, no small matter in a world where men killed for less.\n\nBut numbers can lie, or at least mislead, like mirages in the financial desert. We needed more. We needed to know if these differences were real or merely phantoms dancing in the statistical light. So we dug deeper, into the standard deviations of each holding, normalizing them like preparing bodies for burial, to compare them against the whole of IHF itself.",
            "The numbers fell hard that third month, like winter birds shot from a cold gray sky. You could see it there in Figure 17 plain as death. The kind of fall that makes a man question everything he thought he knew. Winter had come to New England the way it always does, merciless and raw, and the bicycles that once crowded the racks stood abandoned like the bones of prehistoric beasts. The people who'd walked now drove. Who could blame them. December brought with it the end of things, the way December always does. Papers needed grading and the holidays loomed like specters and the students scattered to the four winds, carrying with them whatever enthusiasm they'd had for our little crusade.\n\nThey came back in January but the fire was gone. February was worse. Maybe that's just the way of things in this world. The bright flame burns quick and hot then gutters out leaving nothing but ash and memory. We tried to rekindle it come March with what we called the Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate gambit that worked after its fashion, though nothing burns quite the same the second time around.\n\nBut there was something deeper at work, something woven into the fabric of who we are as a people. The car is freedom. The car is power. The car is America herself, and who were we to try to break that covenant. We offered what bribes we could - gift cards for coffee and books and food, the small indulgences that make life bearable. But perhaps we should have thought bigger. A bicycle maybe. A hybrid car gleaming in the sun. An electric vehicle humming with promise. The sort of prize that makes a man's eyes go wide and his heart beat faster. Maybe then they would have stayed with us through the dark months. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen like they did, like dead leaves in autumn, like hope in winter.\n\nWe could have built it up slow, like a fire you mean to last the night. Start with the small things, then the bicycles, then finally the car itself, a beacon drawing them back to us. But we didn't. We stayed our course and watched the numbers fall and now we know better. Now we know what it takes to fight against the current of human nature, to swim upstream against the river of American dreams.",
            "They were there in the darkness of the archives, those ancient reels of celluloid, fifteen in number, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, each bearing Edison's mark. Magic boxes containing illusions wrought not by God but by man's own devilry with the machine. I watched them all, every flickering frame, studying their nature like some pilgrim seeking truth in sacred texts.\n\nThese phantoms danced upon the screen bound by rules older than the medium itself. They moved in their fixed space like creatures caught between worlds, trapped in a proscenium arch that served as both window and prison. The camera stood witness, unmoved and unmoving, capturing figures that dared not approach it, as if held back by some invisible force that commanded their sideways dance.\n\nTake that tale they called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in the last year of the old century. Josh and his kind moved like clockwork figures on their horizontal track, entering stage right like players in some mechanical theatre, never daring to breach the invisible wall between their world and ours. The camera watched, patient and merciless in its fixed gaze.\n\nThese moving pictures bore the bloodline of the theatre, that ancient art that kept its performers at arms length from those who watched. No face ever loomed large upon the screen, no eye ever pierced the veil between player and viewer. They kept their distance, these ghosts of light, performing their tricks in long shot or medium frame, never closer, never intimate.\n\nMost curious was how these mechanical dreams confined themselves to single breaths, one shot containing all there was to tell, rarely stretching beyond sixty seconds of life. Yet even in this brevity there lay deception. What appeared whole was oftentimes stitched together from separate pieces, like a corpse reassembled for viewing. The Execution of Mary showed this truth plain enough - watch close and you'll see where they cut more than just the queen's head, splicing reality itself to serve their illusion.\n\nThese were our first lies told in light, our first attempts to make the impossible real through the sorcery of the machine. And like all lies, they held their own peculiar truth.",
            "The Gothic Novel stands as both old and new, a thing that carries within it the seeds of its own contradiction. Like some ancient tomb unearthed in modern soil it bears the weight of ages past while speaking to those who would dig it up anew. Ian Watt called it what it was. An oxymoron. Old-New. And men have praised it and damned it in equal measure, some saying it held no depth while others spoke of Burke's terrible sublime like preachers speaking of divine revelation.\n\nWhen Horace Walpole birthed the first true Gothic tale in The Castle of Otranto he didnt know what dark thing he had loosed upon the world. He took the ancient ways of romance and wedded them to something modern and in doing so created a bastard child that would outlive its father. The theatrical elements of old merged with what men called the mimicry of nature and from this union came what Walpole himself named A Gothic Story. The word gothic itself had been worn smooth by time and use, passed through countless mouths to describe peoples and buildings and times long dead. Some saw it as primitive. Backward. A thing best left in the past while society marched ever forward into what they called progress. But the marriage of theatrical gothic elements with the psychological intimacy of the novel created something that refused to die, that was somehow both ancient and newborn with each reading.\n\nThe ghost of chivalry haunts these pages like a revenant that cannot rest. In Otranto the medieval notions of knightly virtue are both preserved and transformed, like a body that has been both mummified and mutilated. Walpole and his kind clung to these ideals of the brave and honorable knight precisely because such men had vanished from the world, if they had ever truly existed at all. The gothic past became a dream of something better, a time when men knew honor and duty and did not shy from either. Walpole wrote in dark times, when politics had grown foul and accusations flew like carrion birds. Perhaps he thought that something fundamental had been lost, some essential goodness that had once lived in men's hearts but had withered and died in the modern world. We see this most clearly in Frederic, a character who carries the weight of chivalric virtue like a crown of thorns. He comes to us first in description, a prince who has known suffering, who has walked away from tragedy, who men believe fell fighting the infidel. The gallant and courteous Knight exists in these pages as something larger than life, excessive in his virtue as all things in Gothic tales must be excessive.",
            "Supply chain it moves like a river through the land of commerce. Raw materials to finished goods flowing ever onward to the waiting hands of customers who know not from whence it came. In 1982 a man called Oliver gave name to this thing that had existed nameless since the first trader walked the first road with the first goods. He called it supply chain management and in doing so he captured the essence of planning and control and implementation that feeds the hunger of want.\n\nSix pillars hold up this temple of commerce. Production. Supply. Inventory. Location. Transportation. Information. Like ancient gods they stand watch over the flow of goods, and the men who tend to business bow before them seeking favor in the marketplace.\n\nProduction stands first among these, a cornerstone laid deep in the bedrock of enterprise. It asks the questions that must be answered. When. Why. Where. How. The managers peer into the great void of the marketplace like seers reading entrails, seeking signs of what the people want. The market speaks in whispers of demand and they must listen close to hear its truth. Then they must decide what will be born into the world and in what numbers and from which wombs of industry it will come forth.\n\nI knew this truth when I worked the floors of Walmart and Target both. There was a scripture for everything. How to dress. How to move. How to receive the great trucks that came like metal beasts in the night bearing their cargo. Everything written down in books like industrial bibles telling all who would read them the proper way of things.\n\nSupply comes next in the procession. It speaks of capabilities and partnerships and the breaking of whole things into parts. Managers must look upon their domains and know which pieces fit where like some great industrial puzzle. Sometimes they must reach out beyond their walls to other makers and other doers, seeking that thing called velocity. Velocity that promises quality and flexibility while keeping the coin in the purse, though few who seek it truly find it.",
            "They were books of another time. Victorian they called them. All manner and detail laid out like bones in the desert sun, bleached white with aristocratic concern and societal affairs that meant nothing to the dead or dying. But there were others. Different ones. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stood apart like dark sentinels in the gathering dusk, their pages filled with a mystery that crawled beneath the skin like fever dreams. They bore witness to things that proper society dared not speak of.\n\nIn one such passage the boy Oliver walks through a fevered haze. He walks with killers. With Sikes and Crackit who argue in voices that echo through his skull like gunshots in an empty church. The words come and go like wind through dead grass. Then the real shots ring out and the night explodes in fire and screaming and lights that dance like devil-moths against his eyes. Some force, nameless and terrible, drags him through the chaos while pain gnaws at him like a starved dog that won't let go.\n\nThese fever dreams run through both books like dark water through underground caves. In Oliver's tale they show what lies beneath, the rot and the fear and the helplessness of a child caught in the machinery of fate. When the shooting comes back to him in the twenty-eighth chapter it comes like a visitation, like something holy and terrible both. The boy relives it all while his body searches for salvation it dont believe in. He's powerless. Always was. The pain aint even a surprise no more, just a companion walking beside him in the dark. The question aint about who shot him. The question is about whose will brought the boy to this place, because it sure wasnt his own. Old Fagin had worked his poison deep, wearing down the boy's spirit like water wearing down stone until there wasnt nothing left but acceptance of the dark.\n\nTime itself becomes a stranger. Day passes into night or maybe there never was a day at all. Just darkness bleeding into darkness while silence stretches out like a rope with no end.",
            "Years back I worked with the young ones after their schooling was done for the day. Small faces bent over books and papers in the late afternoon light. Most I could help well enough but reading and words were what I knew best. There was this boy called Adrian, might have been eight or nine, who couldn't read worth a damn. Something wasnt right with how he saw the letters. Some he knew like old friends and others may as well have been hieroglyphs scratched in ancient stone. His English was pure as mountain water but his blood was Mexican sure enough. We fought those letters like they were demons until the day his mother came.\n\nShe walked in while I was minding the stragglers left behind from some excursion. Not a word of English passed her lips, just rapid-fire Spanish like soft bullets. My own Spanish was poor and broken but we made do with gestures and half-understood words. That's when the truth hit me like a hammer blow. Adrian could read just fine. It was our strange English letters that were foreign to him, not the words themselves. Whether that knowledge ever served him I cannot say.\n\nI tell this tale because it speaks to something deeper, something that runs through the veins of our schools here in California like a dark current. The wall between languages aint always what you'd expect. Even a child who speaks English pure as springwater might stumble when the letters dance strange on the page. We all know this devil exists but the killing of it aint so simple. For Adrian the medicine was clear enough - teach him our letters, teach him our sounds. But for them that barely speak English the cure aint so clean. No single answer exists in this world or the next. Dual language learning, throwing them in the deep end, private teaching, special English classes - none of these alone will slay the beast. The truth lies in using them all like weapons in an arsenal.\n\nThe dual language way of teaching aint just for the Spanish speakers but for all our young ones. Studies show these children rise above their peers like hawks over field mice. Some folk fear it's wasteful, that most children won't gain nothing from it. That's a lie black as pitch. If we made this the way instead of the exception, every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Force every teacher to speak two tongues? No, that's a fool's errand. But having them that can speak both languages helping in the classroom, that's no dream but a real possibility hard as iron.",
            "From youth we are told of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the boundaries of what mind can hold. They shepherd the young ones to wooden buildings with crosses hung like dead things on the walls or to temples where old men in robes speak ancient words. Some take what their mothers and fathers gave them and hold it close like a blanket against the dark while others cast it away saying there aint nothing out there but what we know and what we see. And we take up these beliefs like weapons only to lay them down again for different ones when the first ones fail us. Each soul walking its own path through the spiritual dark searching for some light to lead it home.\n\nThe old man said cardinal and nothing more. We set there on the porch listening to the rain hammer the tin roof while smoke from our cigarettes rose up in pale wisps to join the clouds. Water poured from the gutters and drowned the flowers that grew there, petals beaten flat against the mud. He looked out into the gray distance with eyes that seemed to see both now and then at once. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's and his head showed pale through thinning hair. He wouldnt look at me. I knew I could not speak of what was coming for speaking makes real what we wish was not. I moved closer and hugged him and we sat there watching the June rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and machines had kept him breathing past their predictions but what good was breath when it only meant more pain. What sort of god would craft such torment. In the nighttime I spoke no prayers for if there was a god he had turned his face from me long ago.\n\nI would not watch him die. Could not. The life that gave me life deserved better than my witness to its ending. I knew him better than they did. Better than the blood kin that gathered round his bed. He would not want his child to watch death take him. So I lay curled in my bed for three days waiting for word.\n\nNone came.",
            "He walked the fields of Caroline county and knew the soil like his own blood. John Taylor. Man of the earth and of words both. The land spoke to him in ways that politics never could though he served in that capacity too and the marriage of these things made him what he was. A voice crying out against the wilderness of government overreach. Against the darkness that men brought forth when they strayed from honest work.\n\nThe republic stood newborn on the continent like some vast experiment in human nature. No ancient ghosts to bind it. No old world chains to wear. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible possibility. The chance to build something true. He knew that rights given by God or nature or whatever power ruled the hearts of men were like bones in a skeleton. Break one and the whole thing goes wrong. Goes twisted. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government that would call itself just.\n\nIn the raw state of nature the strong preyed upon the weak and the clever preyed upon both but Taylor believed civilization must rise above such base instincts. Must find a way to account for the light and dark that dwelled in every human heart. Good and evil. No middle ground between them. He wrote that government carried all the virtues and vices of the men who wielded it, like a sword that could heal or harm depending on whose hand held the hilt.\n\nThe principles he called good were simple things. Protection of what a man owned. The enhancement of agriculture. The restraint of those who would profit from paper and promises rather than honest work. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but like fire it could warm a home or burn it down. Government must contain this force, must channel it, must be watched always lest it turn from servant to master.\n\nHe stood with others who read the Constitution like scripture, demanding every word be weighed and measured. The federal government must be bound tight, he said, kept small, kept lean, kept honest. A bloated government would turn tyrant as surely as meat turns rotten in summer heat. But words alone were not enough. The spirit of the law must be known, must be held sacred. The Declaration that came before was truer still, he thought. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation. Separate fires burning bright against the dark.",
            "He stood and looked down and the looking was a thing without meaning or purpose save that it was done. The mind worked at it like some machine spinning in emptiness, taking in what lay before it and letting go again without holding to any truth or knowing. Thoughts came and went like smoke in a wind. No thought stayed.\n\nHe'd bought him a book once. Some woman artist had told him of it. About drawing and the mind and how these things worked together or didnt work together and how a man might learn to see what was before him truly and not just what his mind told him ought to be there. The book spoke of frames. How putting a frame around a thing made it something else entirely. How a kitchen full of things became just a bowl of fruit on a table if you framed it right.\n\nStanding there he couldnt frame nothing. The sight was too big for frames. Like them painters of old had their colors. Blues and greens and all the colors of God's earth. If he was to paint this scene it would be brown. Nothing but brown.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Touched it. The muscles worked beneath the skin like creatures with their own purpose. Water moved in its ancient circles. Clear as light itself. Things broke apart in it and vanished. He worked the handle again. Faster now. Urgent. The brown mass stayed fixed like something alive and willful. Like it had made up its mind to stay.\n\nHe stood there in his tie that choked at his throat. Green like poison. Feet planted like a man about to receive news of death. The mop loose in his grip like a broken standard. Some previous visitor had left this offering. This message to them that cleaned the drugstore toilets. He flushed again and again and watched the water move and settle and move again. Then his hand went to the paper. Wrapping and wrapping until the hand was white as bone. He bent at the waist like a man in prayer. The hand went down into the water like something seeking baptism in darkness...",
            "They die on the roads these children. Die in twisted metal and shattered glass while the night wraps around them like a shroud. The government men in their white coats say the young brain aint ready for such things but they dont need to tell what any fool can see with his own eyes. Inexperience sits heavy in their bones and death rides shotgun in their fathers pickup trucks.\n\nThe children gather like crows. Two then three then four in a car and the metal beast beneath them growls with promise and threat both. Studies done in California show what we already know in our hearts - that death multiplies with each young soul added to the cabin. Some states try to hold back the tide with their paper laws and provisional permits but its like trying to dam a river with chicken wire.\n\nZuckerman the headshrinker says eighteen years aint enough. Says the young ones seek the thrill of speed like junkies seek the needle and they cant help themselves no more than a rattler can help its poison. The boomers babies are coming he says. Coming like a flood to wash our roads in blood and metal and grief.\n\nThe answer lies simple as a coffin nail. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen years have worked their tempering. Let them learn in classrooms and parking lots with teachers watching careful as priests. Make it the same in every state so there aint no place for death to slip through the cracks. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty with a grown soul watching. Numbers writ in law like commandments.\n\nThis aint new thinking.

            "They called it CAPD and it was a thing that lived in the brain and made the sounds wrong. Not in the hearing but in the knowing of what was heard. Like a radio playing through broken glass. The brain took the sounds and twisted them and made them strange and foreign though the ears worked just fine.\n\nThe disorder first showed itself in the middle years of the last century. Italian men with clinical minds sought to understand it. They worked in sterile rooms with machines and wires and children who could not parse the world of sound around them. Kimura came later with his tests of competing sounds fed into separate ears like twin serpents of noise coiling into the skull.\n\nThe affliction manifested in ways various and cruel. Some could not tell where sounds came from in the void of space as if they walked in darkness eternal. Others could not separate one sound from another or know when words meant their opposite through the tone of voice that carried them. The sounds came like waves breaking upon rocks, each one washing away the memory of the last until nothing remained but confusion.\n\nTo diagnose it they brought forth an arsenal of tests and observations like ancient priests seeking auguries in the behavior of their subjects. Audiologists and speech pathologists and psychologists all brought their tools to bear, watching and measuring and recording. They fed sounds into ears and measured the echoes that returned. But no single test could catch this ghost in the machine of the mind, and none could say from whence it came. It remained elusive as smoke, real as rain, present as pain.\n\nThey would sit children in rooms and bombard them with sounds, asking them to pluck meaning from chaos. Numbers and words would rain down like hail, and they would watch as the children struggled to catch them, to hold them, to make sense of the storm. Some could and some could not and in this way they separated the afflicted from the whole.",
            "They'd asked what I aimed to do and I told them plain. Work with the children. The broken ones. The ones cast off and forgotten like old shoes in a ditch. Them that's been touched by darkness that walks in daylight wearing the skin of kin. Values aint just words wrote down in some book. They're carved deep in the bone. Service. Respect. The old ways of right and wrong that dont bend nor break.\n\nI'd wandered some years not knowing my path. Watched folks run from their demons or drown em in whatever poison they could find. Got myself some learning in the ways of the mind at Piedmont College in 09 but still the path weren't clear. Then come a summer day I'll not forget. Boy of sixteen set on my friend's couch like a sparrow ready to fly. Eyes darting. Hands working at nothing. Running from them that should've protected him but didn't.\n\nNext day I drove out to where he come from. Talked to the law standing in that yard where evil had made its home. Told em what I knew from my schooling. They asked me to speak to the parents and I did. Watched em squirm and lie, calling their boy's cry for help manipulation. Simple disputes, they said. Nothing simple about it. That's when I knew what I had to do.\n\nJustice aint just a word neither. Society talks about the worth of one soul while trying to make every soul look the same. I never did hold with that. Through them school years I made my stand. Wore my colors like war paint. Put metal in my flesh where I pleased. Stood with them that society said weren't worth standing with. Fought the old poisons of hate and fear wherever they showed their face. Some folks say protest aint proper. I say there aint nothing more proper than standing against what's wrong.\n\nThat's the truth of it. Plain as I can tell it.",
            "The night comes and with it the darkness that some cannot escape into sleep. There are those who walk among us bearing the curse of wakefulness, their minds racing like wild horses across the vast plains of consciousness while others find peace in the void. They call it insomnia but names mean little to those who suffer its relentless grip.\n\nThe men of science speak of two paths to understanding this affliction. One path leads through blood and bone, through the twisted helixes of our making that we inherit from those who came before. The other winds through the territories of man's own making - the streets and alleys of culture, the borderlands of race and wealth, the dark canyons between rich and poor.\n\nIn the laboratories they keep their mice in plastic boxes, watching as the creatures struggle between wake and sleep. The scientists speak of things called GABAB receptors, tiny gatekeepers in the hypothalamus that stand watch over the kingdom of sleep. They inject their potions - baclofen they call it - and observe as the mice surrender to unconsciousness. As if mice could tell us the secrets of human suffering.\n\nThey mapped these territories of sleep like ancient cartographers, drawing borders between what they call Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, primary disorders and secondary ones. Names upon names, categories within categories, as if naming a thing could capture its essence. Nightmare Disorder. Sleep Terror. Sleepwalking. Words that try to cage the uncageable.\n\nIn the end it all comes down to the firing of neurons in the dark meat of our brains, the dance of chemicals across synaptic gaps, the inheritance of cursed genes passed down like dark heirlooms through generations. And those who cannot sleep walk among us like ghosts, haunting fluorescent-lit offices and sterile classrooms, their eyes heavy with the weight of endless days.",
            "Two and a half years I've walked these grounds. Four and a half seasons come and gone like wind across the valley. The campus stretches vast and merciless, a concrete expanse that swallows souls and time alike. In my first year they put me in East Halls, far out where the morning sun first touches university soil, beyond where most students dare venture save for football and spectacle.\n\nThe path from Stuart Hall to Willard was a pilgrimage. Twenty-five minutes through rain or snow or whatever god saw fit to cast down upon us. The old ones speak of times when East stood alone, islands of brick and mortar in seas of empty land. Now steel and glass rise where emptiness once dwelled. The Creamery. The healing house. Apartments like teeth in a giant's mouth surrounding it all. The campus grows like some living thing, consuming space, making distance longer with each passing season.\n\nWhat salvation exists for those who must traverse these spaces? The bicycle stands alone. Simple machine. Two wheels and frame and chain. But it aint enough to have the machine. You need the riders and you need the paths that welcome them.\n\nI knew a man who returned to the wheel after years away. Said he couldn't reckon why he ever stopped. Called it the only true way to move through this world. A bowl of morning grain can power you thirty miles or more, he said, and I reckon he spoke true.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dormitory, maybe farther. The bike was wisdom purchased cheap. Thomas building lies twenty-five minutes by foot from my door, but the wheels cut it to five if you're willing to push. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but aint always friendly to those who'd ride it. Walking has its merits but time is precious as blood in this place. Without the bike I'd lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day to walking. Two and a half hours every week vanished like morning mist. Add the other wanderings required of a student's life and time becomes a currency you cant afford to spend.",
            "He saw the machines coming and knew their masters well. The World Controllers and their ilk. They had built their glass towers and concrete hives where men moved like insects, each to their own predetermined place in the great mechanism of society. The conditioning began at birth, perhaps before. No man could say. They called it community but it was a prison of the soul.\n\nThe people walked through their lives like sleepwalkers, pursuing pleasure with the mindless determination of addicts. They knew nothing of struggle or pain or the raw truth of existence. The Controller stood above them all like some dark god, dispensing soma and satisfaction in measured doses. Marx had seen it coming. The way the powerful would bend the minds of the weak until they could no longer recognize their own chains.\n\nThere was no love in this brave new world. No hatred neither. Just the endless cycle of consumption and shallow gratification. The men spoke of women like they spoke of machines, measuring their worth in pneumatic qualities and physical dimensions. The women traded stories of their couplings with the detached interest of cattle traders. Each class moved in its ordained circles, never questioning, never rising above their station. The Alphas and Betas, those who might have seen the truth of things, chose blindness instead. All except Bernard, who carried his doubt like a wound.\n\nThe lower orders - Deltas, Gammas, the rest - they were born to their servitude, their minds shaped before they drew first breath. Sleep-teaching had burned away any chance of rebellion or discontent. They consumed and labored and died, believing themselves blessed in their ignorance. The great machinery of capitalism ground on, feeding on their dreams, their desires, their very humanity. And above it all the Controller watched, counting his profits in the coin of human souls.",
            "Four years past I sat in a classroom where they spoke of Islam, voices rising and falling like wind through desert scrub. The question hung there like smoke: was this faith born of violence. Now in these days the question burns hotter still, a flame that won't die down. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and talking heads shifted from raw hatred to something else, something like submission. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest office in this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What they write of Muhammad stands against what history whispers in the dark corners of time. They say he was a peaceful man but I know different. Know how he rode with warriors across the sands, how tribes fell before him like wheat before the scythe, how the sword and the word went hand in hand. Yet in these pages they paint him gentle as a lamb, a martyr walking soft in the world until men saw truth in his eyes and followed. Followed like sheep to water.\n\nAnd there in those pages they write of miracles. Mutton and milk multiplied like some dark echo of another story, older and truer. As if taking the bread and fish from Christ's own hands and putting them in another's. A theft of holy things. Making mockery of sacred blood.\n\nThey tell these tales second-hand, third-hand, passed down like old coins worn smooth with handling. Each teller adding his own truth until truth itself becomes suspect. Like smoke rising from a fire you cannot see.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how they've made him soft, this warrior prophet. Made him meek and mild when history shows his sword arm was strong and his will was iron. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca five times daily know the true face of the man they follow. Know the blood that stains the pages of their past.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he knew in his time upon the earth were cast aside like chaff in the wind, scattered and forgotten in the wake of what men would later call Christian thought. Looking back across the wasteland of centuries we see only the long retreat from truth, each generation stepping further from the light into a darkness of their own making. Yet now in these latter days there comes a stirring, like wind across the desert floor, a wakening that cannot be stilled.\n\nThe old ones still cling to their beliefs like drowning men to driftwood, but their numbers grow thin and their voices fade. Among the faithful there rises a hunger for what was lost, a need to strip away the accretions of time like layers of dead skin until nothing remains but the raw truth of what the Nazarene brought forth from God. It may take generations, maybe centuries, but the wheel turns backward now and cannot be stopped.\n\nThis great undoing will sweep across the lands like wildfire, burning away the false doctrines that men have built, leaving only ash and truth behind. The church will endure, yes, but changed, transformed, stripped back to bone and sinew. Where once a thousand voices sang different songs there will be one voice, one truth, one way. Like rivers flowing backward to their source, all the scattered tribes of Christ will flow together again.\n\nHistory shows us such reversals. Rome that once drank Christian blood became Christ's greatest temple. This land that once bound men in chains now sees those same men's sons in seats of power. And so it will be with the faith itself, unspooling like a thread pulled from an ancient tapestry, until we stand again at the beginning.\n\nBut mark this well: the key that unlocks this door lies in seeing the Christ's words not as dead letters carved in stone but as living water, flowing with meaning beyond mere words. To understand what came after, we must first look back to what came before.\n\nIn those ancient days there was only the faith of Abraham, the wellspring from which Christianity would flow. The one God, the holy books, the revealed truth - these were the foundations laid before Rome's eagles cast their shadow over Jerusalem in the year 63 before the Christ. But even then the people were divided, split like dry wood - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk who knew little of such things.",
            "The darkness that dwells in the heart of man aint nothing new and The Jungle shows it plain as day. Shows how the greed lives deep in the marrow of our bones and how we care nothing for them below us in the great chain of misery that binds us all. You can see it clear as death in them factory owners and managers, them lords of industry who built their empires on broken backs and spilled blood.\n\nThey built their kingdoms of steel and smoke, caring nothing for what lay crushed beneath. Sinclair wrote of how them buildings stood like black teeth against the sky, chimney stacks vomiting endless streams of smoke into the heavens, as if trying to poison God himself. The smoke rolled away toward the horizon like some great serpent, coiling and twisting until it disappeared where the earth meets the sky. The owners, they didnt care none for the poison they put into the air or the filth that ran from their slaughterhouses, rivers of blood and worse things that no man should have to name.\n\nThe workers was nothing more than meat to them. Disposable as the hogs they butchered. There wasnt no loyalty in that place, no decency neither. A man's worth was measured in pennies and dollars, his life cheaper than the copper in his pocket. They worked them men like mules and cast them aside just as quick, no warning, no mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with invisible blood.\n\nThem that lived and died in Packingtown, they was caught in a web of their own making, though they didnt weave it themselves. No escape from the grinding machinery of industry that ate men whole and spit out bones. The unions that was supposed to help only fed off their misery like vultures on carrion. The foreign workers, them that came seeking the American dream, found instead an American nightmare. They hung there between life and death, survival dependent on the whims of men who was no better than the slave drivers of old. Their suffering was as certain as winter frost, their degradation as inevitable as darkness following light. And there aint no law of God or man that could save them from it.",
            "They called it Dream-land and Poe knew it for what it was. He'd written it himself and called it among his better works though such things dont matter now and didnt matter then. The word Thulé appeared twice like dark sentinels at the edges of his verse, borrowed perhaps from Virgil who'd used it to name some distant shore beyond Britain where the Greeks reckoned the world fell away into darkness. But there was something else. Something closer.\n\nThe German writers had gotten into his blood. Among them was Goethe whose words Poe knew well enough that scholars like Karl J. Arndt would later trace the shadowed footprints between their works, seeing in Poe's lines an echo of the master's voice.\n\nGoethe himself was dead by then. His Faust lay in two parts like a bifurcated serpent, the first coiled in 1808 and the second dying with him in 1832. Within those pages there was a tale of a king and his dead queen and a goblet that carried both memory and grief. The king drank deep and wept deeper until at last he walked to the edge of all things and cast the cup into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into the dark. It wasnt hard to see Poe's own darkness there, his own cup of sorrow, his own dead love.\n\nThe word Thule appeared again in The Pit and the Pendulum but it was in Dream-Land where it found its true home, standing guard at beginning and end like black-robed sentries. The landscapes of both tales stretched out across the same wastes: colorless, empty, populated only by ghosts and memories that wouldnt die proper deaths but lingered like smoke in still air.\n\nPoe knew Goethe's work as surely as he knew his own demons. He spoke of Tennyson's admiration for the German and in doing so revealed his own. The words had been there all along, waiting in translations and adaptations, seeping into the soil of American letters like blood into sand.",
            "The law speaks of malice and rights and consequences but the truth of it is darker than any book of statutes. In the failing light of an October evening in California a manager sat eating his dinner while death or something like it waited patient in the aisles of his store. The spill lay there like some primordial ooze, transparent and lethal, the crushed remains of apples processed and jarred and shipped and spilled and now forming a slick that would alter the course of lives yet unknown.\n\nThey came to him twice. First Wayne and then Haddigan bearing news of the hazard but Martin would not be moved from his repast. He sat unmoved and uncaring like some petty god pronouncing judgment on the affairs of mortals beneath his notice. The store bore already the history of five who had fallen that year alone, their bodies caught in gravities cruel embrace, but such things did not trouble Martin's thoughts.\n\nWhen Palmer fell it was as if ordained. Her back broke not with a sound but with a feeling, something ancien and terrible coursing through bone and sinew. The law speaks of conscious disregard and willful negligence but these are just words meant to cage the darkness in mens hearts. Martin knew what lay in wait in his domain. Knew it as sure as he knew the taste of the food he would not leave. Knew it as sure as he knew of those who had fallen before.\n\nThe question before the judge is one of punishment beyond mere compensation, of whether such calculated indifference rises to the level of malice that the law demands for special retribution. The evidence speaks clear enough. Six times the floor had claimed its tribute in that year alone. Two warnings ignored while dinner grew cold. These are not mere oversights but markers on a map leading to something darker in the soul of man. The law may speak of summary judgments but no judge would dare dismiss such darkness without letting light shine full upon it.",
            "The wanting lived in her like a thing alive. It had come upon her at fourteen summers and stayed, a shadow companion through the years that followed. By seventeen it had shaped itself not into want of things but of someone, though no boy that crossed her path stirred anything in her blood. They came and went like leaves in autumn, their awkward advances scattered to wind. She studied this emptiness in herself like studying tracks in sand, theories rising and falling away like tide, none substantial enough to hold weight.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who walked soft in the world and spoke softer still. Arguments were rare as rain in drought season, save when their daughter's wild spirit pressed against the walls of their quiet life like wind through canyon walls. She carried within her a fire that burned bright against their stillness, yet it was a warmth that drew others near, not a consuming flame.\n\nBut this day carried darkness. Moving room to room seeking something unnamed she heard her mother's cry cut through the kitchen air sharp as breaking glass. She ran. Found her mother crumpled on tile like a broken bird. Pain wrapped round her mother's words tight as barbed wire. Hospital, she managed. The girl's hands found purchase, muscles remembering their training, and she bore her mother out like precious cargo through the door and into the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital air hung thick with bleach and suffering and fear but she noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She carried her through doors that whispered open, voice rising raw for help. White-coated figures materialized like ghosts, wheeling out a stretcher that swallowed her mother whole. Then she was alone with the waiting.\n\nAll this because her mother had reached too high, seeking some ceramic beauty in cabinets that touched the ceiling. The stepping stool had betrayed her like false ground giving way beneath trusted feet.",
            "The dead speak in numbers and the living count their meals. They sought truth in the eating habits of women, watching what passed their lips like priests taking count of sins. Mediterranean fare they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from fruits that grew in ancient soils. No potatoes. The flesh of beasts kept sparse upon their plates. Wine in moderation like a sacrament.\n\nThey had seen before how this way of eating kept death at bay. Studies writ in blood and paper showed how hearts beat longer, stronger when fed thus. The fat ones shed their burden easier this way than counting grams of lard and butter. But none had watched the brain and how it fails when vessels burst.\n\nThey gathered seventy-four thousand women and more, nurses all, scattered across eleven states like seeds in wind. For twenty years they watched them eat and die or live. Six times they made them write their testimony of meals, marking down each morsel like confessions. Most stayed true to the watching, year after year, while some vanished into the dark of time.\n\nThe counters of meals verified their methods. When death came they checked the records, the papers of hospitals, the certificates that mark a life's end. Some they called probable when proof was thin, these made up less than a quarter of the fallen.\n\nThey weighed the women, noted their smoke and pills, their monthly cycles and the hormones they took. How they moved their bodies in leisure counted too. The numbers they gathered like crows collecting bright things, seeking patterns in the chaos of living.\n\nWhen the counting ended, the truth lay bare in figures cold as corpses. Two thousand hearts failed, seventeen hundred brains bled or starved, and a thousand souls departed through paths carved by broken vessels. Those who ate as the ancients did, who scored highest in their Mediterranean ways, they lived longer. The numbers spoke clear: their risk of failing hearts and minds fell by more than a quarter compared to those who ate as modern folk do.\n\nIn the end, the numbers told a story old as olive groves: how we eat marks how we die.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma the sign said. The girl stood there holding it above her head like some proclamation of doom writ in black ink against the cardboard. She was an actor in films. The kind that made people feel good about themselves.\n\nIn the east where the sun rises red over jungle and plain there is a country of ghosts. Burma they called it once. Myanmar now. Men in uniform took it like thieves in the night. They came in 1962 with guns and proclamations and they never left. The monks rose up against them wearing robes colored like dried blood. Saffron they called it. The monks walked and they prayed and the people followed them into the streets like children following the piper. At first the men with guns watched. Then they didnt. They came in the night with their boots and their rifles and broke down the doors of the monasteries. Sacred places violated by the godless. A Japanese man with a camera died on a street corner. Just another body. They said thirteen died but a soldier who ran told different. Thousands he said. Thousands of bodies. Where they buried them no one knows.\n\nIt aint nothing new. Since man first walked upright and found he could rule over others by force there have been such things. Roman emperors who claimed divine right. Japanese kings who said they were gods themselves. Even now men who wear suits instead of crowns claim to speak for god while they deal in death.\n\nThe examples lay scattered through time like broken pottery. In China they gunned down students in a square while tanks rolled past. The government said three hundred. The truth was thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. The streets ran with blood and no one came to help. And before all that there was Hitler. He killed millions. Rounded them up like cattle. Branded them. Burned them. Made them into smoke that rose up to accuse the very heavens. And now perhaps his spirit walks in Burma where the monks once walked. Where the dead lay unnamed in unmarked graves. Where the men with guns still rule.",
            "The legacy of Duke they called Ellington ran deep through the veins of jazz like old blood through ancient stone, his years stretched long across the century and with them came power to shape sound and men alike. At the piano his touch was light as morning frost but in the writing of music he was more akin to some dark demiurge, crafting worlds of sound where men could walk free yet bound, improvising within the walls he built note by note, bar by bar. He knew these men, knew their souls and the sounds that lived in them, knew how to call forth those sounds like a conjurer of old spirits. The orchestra was his instrument and he played it like some great and terrible organ, pulling stops and pressing keys that were the very souls of men.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of Grove they speak of his Creole Love Call, how he made the human voice cry out like brass and wood, wordless and pure as desert wind. Through six circles of blues it winds, each a testament to his craft. First comes the voice against reeds like two wolves calling across valley darkness, then the muted trumpet wailing blue notes into the void. High above a clarinet keens while piano notes fall like rain beneath. The full band rises then, brass and reed locked in their eternal dance, until all culminates in a great crescendo where reeds cry out against the syncopated heartbeat of brass and rhythm. At last the voice returns, growling like some nightbound creature, before all ends in discord and darkness.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded when the moon had walked another year across the sky, he bound together the tight-wound strings of orchestration with colors drawn from the very air. Miley's trumpet called and Cox's voice answered, man and instrument trading places in some strange alchemy of sound. And when It Don't Mean a Thing rose up from silence, there was Nanton, called Tricky Sam by those who knew him, drawing forth the melody from his muted horn like an old priest reading ancient scripture, the sound of it hanging in the air like smoke from a long-dead fire.",
            "They come to ask why things change the way they do. As if the world held answers plain and true for those who'd seek them. Back in 1917 a man called Thompson spoke of how we ain't yet learned to put numbers to the shapes of living things and truth be told we ain't much further along now neither.\n\nThe shells lay there like ancient scrolls writ in a language we barely understand. They spiral through time and space like cosmic dancers frozen in calcium carbonate, each whorl telling its own tale of life and death and change. We took to studying these Prunum shells, their ghostly forms caught in X-ray light, trying to capture their essence in numbers and equations like trying to trap starlight in a jar.\n\nThe shell grows like a living cathedral, turning through the void in perfect mathematical arcs that we ain't yet got the wisdom to fully comprehend. Each revolution marks time like the rings of a tree or the layers of earth in canyon walls. The columella stands at the center like some ancient axis mundi, holding everything together while the whorls spiral out around it like a sermon on creation itself.\n\nYou can read these shells like a book if you know how. Count the whorls from where the first suture begins, marking time in quarter turns like some cosmic clock. The aperture traces its path through space leaving behind it this perfect geometric testament to life's endless variations. Each shell carries in its form the history of its kind, written in calcium and protein, waiting for them as can read such things.\n\nWe fed these measurements into machines, trying to capture in silicon and electricity what nature had wrought in lime and water over millions of years. The numbers dance across screens like prophets speaking in tongues, telling tales of what might have been and what yet could be. But the truth of it all remains elusive, like trying to catch smoke in your hands or hold back the tide with a broom.",
            "The dead children of Indonesia lay like fallen birds in their mothers' arms, their numbers unchanging through the years, a dark testament to a nation's struggle. Ten years passed and still they died, these small ones, while men in offices spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams. They spoke of water flowing clean and proper places to shit but the children kept dying all the same and the mothers too, their blood flowing out across dirt floors in villages where no doctor ever set foot.\n\nIn the cities they had women who knew the old ways of birth, midwives they called them, their hands skilled in the catching of babies but helpless when the darkness came and the blood wouldn't stop. Seven of ten births they attended but it wasnt enough. Never enough. The diarrhea came for the young ones too and fewer hands reached out to help them now than before. After the births the mothers lay alone, no one watching for the fever or the bleeding that might take them in the night.\n\nThe knife that opens the belly to free the child, they called it cesarean, rare as rain in the dry season. In the cities maybe seven women in a hundred felt its mercy but in the villages only two. The poor died easier than the rich, that's how it always was and how it remained. Twenty-seven souls in a hundred turned away from the hospital door, their pockets empty as their hopes.\n\nThey argued about it in their offices with their papers and their coffee. Some said to build special programs like towers reaching to heaven, each one targeting its own kind of death. Others wanted to strengthen what was already there, the bones and sinews of the healing places. The tower-builders talked fast about quick results but they didn't speak of how their grand designs pulled the healers away from other work, how the money flowed to one place while other needs withered like crops in drought. And everywhere the paper multiplied like leaves in autumn, forms upon forms, each program demanding its own kind of truth written in its own kind of way.",
            "The music they call Popular has grown wild and untamed these hundred years past, sprouting genres like weeds in an abandoned field till no man could count them all. And within each genre - the rap and the rock and the country and all their kin - subspecies breed and multiply like dark thoughts in a fever dream.\n\nHeavy Metal, bastard child of rock, has perhaps grown most feral of all. Forty years it has roamed the musical wasteland, gathering darkness unto itself like a shroud. It feeds on emotion - raw and bleeding emotions that decent folk dont speak of. Early on the people saw how this beast could be trained, could be bred into new forms. And breed it did. New forms begat newer forms until the original creature was lost in the thundering herd of its progeny.\n\nNow the beast has so many faces that men argue what truly makes the metal what it is. It has consumed other genres, digested them, made them its own. To know the thing you must go back. Back to where it first crawled from the primordial muck of music. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal lives in darkness. It is a thing of excess - excess in all things. In volume and violence and theatrical display. Its practitioners are skilled beyond mere playing, they are technicians of chaos. And there are the drugs. Always the drugs. In the middle years of the seventies the drugs came like a flood and the music turned strange and otherworldly. Men made records that normal folk couldn't comprehend and blamed it on the chemicals coursing through their veins. The darkness in it was new. Popular music hadn't known such shadows before. Later metal drew from the old Romantics, those who knew darkness too. Even the Beatles, those clean-cut boys, succumbed. Their Helter Skelter was among the first, a response to the Stones' own darkness. They wanted to prove they could walk in those shadows too.",
            "In the years before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions the man called Rousseau had already begun to paint his own dreams both in sleep and in waking. The Dream came in 1910 and in it lay not just some woman struck dumb by the savage beauty of a dreamed land but the very essence of Rousseau's own yearnings wrought in oils and pigments. He had long sought the approval of those who deemed themselves fit to judge such things, those who spoke in hushed tones in gilded halls about what made art worthy and what did not. And in this seeking he found himself torn between two paths, each stretching out before him like roads in some dark wood. One path led to mimicry and conformity, the other to a wild independence that knew no masters.\n\nThe man himself came into this world on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town that squatted in the northwestern reaches of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware, living well enough by the standards of those days. The boy learned no art save what his own hands taught him and for forty years he collected tolls for the state, a gabelou they called him though some named him douanier which was not right but stuck to him all the same. His first wife Clémence passed into whatever darkness awaits us all, following eight babes who never drew breath long enough to know the world. Only Julia remained, his daughter, while grief sat heavy upon him like some ancient stone. He turned to painting then as a man turns to water in the desert, seeking salvation in the sweep of brush against canvas.\n\nUnlike the others who painted in those days, men who made the peasants into something fine and noble in their pictures, Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common men dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, men like Matisse who had learned their craft in proper schools and whose names carried weight in the salons where such things mattered. Gordon wrote that Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to paint so well and true that the Artiste Français would welcome him into their ranks. But such things were not to be, not then, not in the way he hoped.",
            "They say truth and beauty walk together like old companions on a dusty road and maybe they do. The great minds spoke of it and wrote of it in their books and papers yellowed now with age, their words fading like the memories of dead men. Keats knew it when he wrote of that old urn, speaking truth to beauty and beauty back to truth in some eternal dance that none could parse nor need to.\n\nWe learn what we know from books and life and pain but these things, these twin spirits of right and beautiful, they come to us like night comes to the desert. No teacher showed us how. No mother pointed to a sunset and said here child this is beauty mark it well. We know it in our bones like ancient things know the earth.\n\nYou can write about why something's right or wrong or beautiful or damned but the words just scatter like birds from a field when the truth of it comes round. Take that painting of the woman with the smile. Men have spent lifetimes talking about shadow and light and what lies behind those eyes but none of it tells you why it catches in your throat when you stand before it. There's something else there. Something that won't be caught in words no matter how fine the net we weave.\n\nO'Connor knew it. Said a story was the only way to tell some truths and even then the telling wasn't complete. Like trying to describe the taste of water to a man who's never drunk. Wittgenstein too, though he used bigger words to say the same thing. That ethics lives somewhere beyond where words can reach.\n\nAnd there's the heart of it. The moral and the beautiful, they live in that space between what we can say and what we can know. Like old ghosts that we can feel but never touch. That's why books carry such weight with us. They're not just words on pages but mirrors of the soul, showing us what's right and wrong in ways we can't explain but know deep in that place where knowing starts. They carry values like a river carries water, flowing through us, shaping us, but never quite letting us hold them still enough to study.",
            "The Germany that stands now rises like some ancient colossus, its borders drawn in blood and stone from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the cold gray waters of Kiel where the Baltic laps at shores old as memory itself. This land speaks with one voice, though its tongue differs from the Rhine-blessed Köln through the heartland to Dresden where the Elbe cuts its path like a steel thread through time. That such a place should birth itself from many wombs seems ordained, written in the very soil that bore the tribes of old.\n\nIn the time before time Germania lay vast and dark, its name a whispered thing that scholars still war over like ravens fighting for carrion. Tacitus, that Roman chronicler of blood and conquest, spoke of the Tungrians who bore the name German before crossing the Rhine to wage their war against the Gauls. Caesar too marked these people in his accounts, dipping his pen in both ink and blood to tell of the Germanic hordes that crossed the great river with malice in their hearts. He borrowed their name from Gaulish tongues, marking those he'd broken from those who still stood free beyond his reach. Some say the word meant neighbor in that ancient speech, while others claim it spoke of the spear they carried, the ger, or maybe it came from Irish words meaning to cry out, as if the very name could capture the battle-howls of a people who knew nothing but war.\n\nTacitus wrote of them again in his Germania, claiming them pure as winter snow, untouched by foreign blood or strange customs. Who indeed, he asked, would leave warm southern lands for this raw country where the sky itself seemed to wage war on those below? What man would choose such a place unless it was already burned into his bones?\n\nAnd Rome, that great devourer of lands and men, sent its legions north but never truly claimed these forests and marshlands as their own. They came for amber and iron, for slaves and glory, but always they returned south, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices. These people dwelt in the shadow of empire, trading goods torn from the earth and the strength of their sword arms in service to Rome's eagles, but they remained their own masters, waiting in the dark forests for their time to come.",
            "The shadows of deception run deep in Twelfth Night where masks and falsehoods serve their purpose until they don't and a soul must cast off its borrowed skin lest it be forever lost in the dark corridors of its own making. There aint no easy way back from such deceptions neither. A body finds itself cast out standing alone in the cold world of truth having to choose between keeping what's left of their own self or holding onto them that's around them. Some folk take kindly to learning they been fooled while others carry that betrayal like a wound that won't heal.\n\nWhen it comes to them that choose to wear the clothes of the opposite sex the matter gets darker still. The question that haunts like a ghost in an empty room is why. Why does a person turn their back on what God gave them to take up false dress. With Viola we know. She speaks it plain: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" The words hang there like a confession.\n\nBeing cast upon strange shores Viola done what she had to do to keep breathing in a world that would sooner see her dead. Her deception worked right enough but it cut her off from her own kind leaving her to walk alone among women who couldn't know her true self. And then there's Olivia who looks at her with eyes full of love meant for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The weight of it all bears down harder still when Orsino speaks words that cut like knives: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThem that read this tale now might see something different in it. Might see how lies can sometimes dig up truths that were buried deep. Olivia and Orsino both carry something inside them that Viola's presence forces into the light. Whether Olivia loves Cesario cause she sees a man or cause something else stirs in her blood aint clear but Shakespeare seems to be mocking them that judge only by what their eyes tell them.\n\nYou can see it plain when Olivia turns her love from Cesario to Sebastian quick as a prairie fire jumping track and starts calling Viola sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" The words fall final like stones in still water.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across African plains. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names that echoed like hollow bells in the void of their extinction. But empires aint never been simple things to reckon with and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, each claw marking the soil different from the last.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Black faces bent over books in the harsh light, words swimming before their eyes like strange fish in deeper waters. The British came in 1919 and found what the Germans had built there. Schools standing like sentinels in the dust. But south and west it was different. There the missionaries walked alone among the people, government coin scarce in their pockets while white children sat in proper schools built with proper means.\n\nThe land there was different too. Not the killing heat of other territories but something more temperate, more forgiving to European blood. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand, these pale riders in a foreign land. More than anywhere else in that scattered empire. They built their world there atop the old one, like layers of sediment pressing down through time.\n\nThe books tell it different ways. German words stacked in neat rows speaking of systems and methods, of civilizing missions in distant lands. Later came the English writers, comparing one piece of earth against another, measuring success in literacy rates and school attendance like counting cattle at auction. Cohen wrote of it too, saying the whites who settled there shaped everything that came after, their presence heavy as lead in the African soil.\n\nBut the truth of it was simpler and harder both. In some places knowledge flowed like water and in others it dried up in the sun, leaving nothing but bare earth and forgotten promises. That was the way of empires. That was the way of men.",
            "They stood there at the border, these two nations, like ancient enemies carved from the same stone. From 1836 to 1893 they warred and watched each other across that line drawn in blood and dust. Fifty-seven years. The war came in 46 and when it was done Mexico lay bleeding and the victor claimed Texas and all the southwest territories like a great carrion bird picking clean the bones of the defeated.\n\nThey fought as men have always fought, for land and pride and the old hatreds that sleep in the hearts of nations. The Americans and the Mexicans carried within them the seeds of their discord - religion, culture, the weight of history itself pressing down upon them like a stone. As it has always been with nations that share borders, that invisible line drawn across the earth became a wound that would not heal.\n\nIn those times the Americans feared what lay south as they had once feared the old specters of their colonial past - Catholicism, monarchy, the Spanish crown that had ruled these lands before them. Like their cold war with the Soviets that would come later, though this was different. This was older. This was blood.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those fifty-seven years. Bandits and raiders crossed that line drawn in sand, ghosting across the desert night to strike at border towns. Both sides sent soldiers to guard that boundary but still the blood flowed. The raids continued until both nations brought their armies to bear, two giants facing each other across the void.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor, like a wounded animal learning to trust the hand that once struck it. The American hunger changed too, from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred faded like tracks in the desert sand, but the memory remained, etched in the bones of both lands.",
            "The sickness came without warning like some dark rider in the night. Fifteen years past now. I was a nurse then, having chose that path not from want but from need, the kind that grows deep in your bones when you've known nothing but want as a child. They'd say you'll never want for work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing arts instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone in the world save for what little I earned and now even that was gone. Fifteen years lived on government mercy and everything I ever called mine has scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and pride. Nothing certain now cept uncertainty itself. Yet this truth remains: without the charity of blood kin and them few true friends I'd have been dead or worse. When calamity comes it strips a body of all pretense of strength.\n\nAin't no man can outrun disaster forever. No matter how you fortify against it some things just too big for one soul to weather alone. The government basket's got holes and the bottom's bout to give way but I'd sooner see Americans learning to trust their neighbor again than watch em all dig separate holes in the ground like scared rabbits.\n\nThey talk bout rugged individualism like it was some kind of gospel truth but what kept our ancestors breathing weren't going it alone. It was breaking bread together and sharing what little they had. Them wagon trains that crossed the mountains didn't make it on account of lone wolves but because they moved as one.\n\nSo yeah, keep your disaster kit. Your pure water tablets and window tape and matches that'll light in a flood. Stack your canned goods high if you got the space. Plant your garden if the good Lord gave you dirt to plant in. But while you're doing all that surviving, might want to learn your neighbor's name. Cause when the real trouble comes, and it will come, ain't no man an island worth living on.",
            "In the old world, before the time of iron and steel and the great machines that would come to rule the earth, there was born a prince. He who would later be known as Buddha. The ancient scrolls speak of his coming in the fifth or sixth century before the Christ child and how he cast aside the riches of his station to wander the dusty roads of existence until enlightenment found him like a thief in the night. His words spread like wildfire through the dry grass of men's souls and from these words came Buddhism, its oldest and most pure form being what men call Theravada.\n\nTwenty five hundred years have passed since then. The religion stands transformed like a tree that has weathered countless storms, its branches twisted by time and circumstance. In Sri Lanka they still perform the water-cutting ceremony, though Buddha himself never spoke of such things. Monks in saffron robes and common folk alike gather at the waters edge, their faces reflecting in the dark surface like ancient memories. The changes run deeper than mere ceremony. They run to the very marrow of what the religion means and what it promises to those who follow its path.\n\nThe changes came from within and without, like wounds that both fester and heal. Some brought by those who walked the path and some by those who stood against it. Some meant to destroy and others changed things without meaning to, like a child who breaks a pottery vessel while reaching for water.\n\nThese forces that shaped the faith came in pairs like dark riders on the horizon. Internal and external. One born of the faithful, be they monk or layman, and one from those who stood outside the walls of belief. Some came with knives drawn and hatred in their hearts, seeking to cut down what Buddha had built. Others came without malice, changing things by their mere presence like wind shapes stone. All these forces moved through the world like spirits, leaving their mark on the faith that Buddha left behind.\n\nThe heart of it beats still. The triple gem they call it: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma holds the ancient words in three vessels - the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its laws, and the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of all things. They speak of Anatta - the absence of soul, of Dukkha - the suffering that walks with all living things, and of Anicca - how nothing endures. Only by seeing these truths can one break free from Sansara, the great wheel of death and rebirth that turns like a millstone grinding souls to dust. When the wheel stops, so too do the three poisons: desire that burns like fever, hatred cold as stone, and delusion that clouds the mind like river mist."
