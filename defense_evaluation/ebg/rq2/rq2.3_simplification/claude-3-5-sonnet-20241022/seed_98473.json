            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

To understand people from other places, we need to learn about their history and what they believe. Instead of trying to change their ways, we should accept them. This is very important when making deals, especially if we have less power in the talks. When we go to another country to make deals, showing respect for their ways helps everyone work better together.\n\nDifferent groups have their own ways of doing things, even within the same country. Companies often have their own special ways. Some want workers to stay late at work, while others let workers go home earlier. You can see how companies are different in how workers dress, how they talk to each other, and who they choose to hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to certain groups.

            "The Bible says, \"The person without wisdom says there is no God.\" This appears in Psalm 14 and starts an important discussion by two religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Both men tried to prove God exists. To compare their ideas fairly, we must accept that they speak of the God described in the Bible. While both men make good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm says. He believes that understanding God comes through faith and looking inside ourselves. He says that because we can think about God in our minds, God must exist. His idea is that proof of God is found in our own thoughts. Anselm tells us we do not need to look outside ourselves to find God. Instead, we can know God exists by thinking about what we already believe to be true. This way of believing without clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different view. He says we can prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith to believe. They could be shown God exists through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gives five ways to prove God exists. These ways look at how things change, how things are caused, why things exist, how things can be better or worse than others, and how nature works together. He shows that God must exist because the world needs God to make sense. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways to help readers understand deeper meanings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. He does this carefully so readers will connect these colors with certain feelings or ideas. This is most clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show sameness or being common. White usually means clean and rich, while gray means old or tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, often wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white in the story: Nick wears white pants to a party, Tom has on a white shirt when he meets his friend, and another woman puts white powder on her face.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show ordinary things too. Nick goes to work through white city streets. The names of party guests become gray writing in his notes. A group of houses looks like pieces of white bread all the same. Simple people and places are white or gray too: the two women had a \"white childhood,\" there are gray cars and gray land in a poor area, and even a man selling dogs is described as gray and old.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When Daisy appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps us understand why Gatsby's love for her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",

They also grow fruit from trees like peaches and lemons. They make honey and grow hot peppers too.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. They often join groups that get food directly from local farms. These farms also let people visit to see how food grows. Some farms let people walk on their land to watch birds and enjoy nature.\n\nGrowing food without chemicals helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the farm. But this kind of farming costs more money. Workers must pull out bad plants by hand and find other ways to stop insects from eating the food. Small farms also cannot save money like big farms do.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is next to a big forest called Cleveland National Forest.

            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection includes many feelings like love, pride, anger, and sometimes being mean. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, they see themselves. When times are very hard, this connection becomes most clear, whether for good or bad. These strong feelings often come with a price. Brothers must deal with what happens because of their feelings. When they look at each other, they see who they really are, not how others see them. Their true self shows in what they do and what happens after.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show these ideas.

The older brother tells us his deep feelings and how he sees the world, which helps us understand why he does what he does.\n\nThe older brother does everything because of pride. From the first time he takes his little brother Doodle outside until their last walk together, he feels angry about having a weak brother. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, to climb trees with, and to swim with. But Doodle was born very sick. His heart was weak, and doctors thought he would die. He could not run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting baby Doodle once. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as people created new things, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. First, they said it was like a flat piece of wax. Later, they said it was like paper, then like a book. Now, many people say it is like a computer. However, these simple comparisons can sometimes lead people to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - like touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals in two ways. First, it builds up from small pieces of information. For example, when you see a black box on white paper, your brain first sees the color and edges. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand faster. This helps you know you are seeing a box and not a hole in the paper.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. For instance, when you look at grass, you see all of it but do not notice each piece. But if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it clearly. The brain checks what is important many times as it works with information.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are three main types of storage: quick memory (for the moment), short memory (for about 20 seconds), and long memory. When information comes in, the brain changes it into a form it can keep. Words, for example, can be stored as pictures of how they look, sounds of how they speak, or ideas of what they mean. Scientists think short memory works by signals moving in circles in the brain. Long memory might be stored in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what it knows. One idea says the brain connects things that go together. For example, in your mind, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" and \"table\" connects to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government pushed banks to do this. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped make these bad loans into complex financial products. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This hurt the whole economy.\n\nThe problems started in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes said this could cause problems if the economy became weak. He was right.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also created new ways to sell these loans to others. This meant that many parts of the economy became tied to house prices. When house prices fell, it hurt everyone.\n\nThe results were very bad. In 2007, the five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in housing debts. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank failed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to share too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or become bored.\n\nIt is better to show what happens than to just tell about it. Sometimes writers want to explain everything before getting to the interesting parts. This is not good writing. Sometimes they want to tell every small detail about every person in the story. This is also not good.\n\nWhen you tell instead of show, you are just giving facts to readers. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person lots of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to readers.\n\nHere is an example: Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. If the writer only uses a few words to tell this, readers will not care about these people. But if the writer shows how the man speaks kindly to his wife, and shows how the wife's life becomes better because of him, readers will care more. They will understand why his death makes the wife sad. They will want to know what happens to her next.\n\nWriters need to add more to their simple story ideas. Sometimes writers want to hurry and tell everything about a person right away. For example, they might want to quickly tell you that someone was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station at night, has been married two times, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and what he ate for breakfast. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only said he had hurt his wife many times and the police had caught him.\n\nThe second story told about a young man, Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I felt the story was too short, maybe because the victim was a black man in a black area. I have seen that news programs often give less time to stories about people who are not white.\n\nThey then talked about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said the shot came from a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money to find who did it.\n\nNext came news about rain and storms coming on Saturday. They said it would not be too hot that weekend. They kept this story short to make people keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. The court said he must stay in prison for 300 months. I thought it was strange they did not just say 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "I want to explain what an ETF is and study if it is a good way to invest money. An ETF is like a basket of different stocks that you can buy and sell easily. It works much like buying a single company's stock, but it contains many different companies.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you get two main good things. First, your money is spread across many companies, which makes it safer. Second, you can buy or sell it quickly, just like a regular stock. Also, ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investment choices.\n\nHowever, there are some problems. Each time you buy or sell an ETF, you must pay a small fee. But there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from, which is good.\n\nIn this study, I looked at one ETF called IHF to see if it was really as good as owning the separate stocks it contains. To make this easier to understand, I only looked at the ten biggest companies in this ETF, which make up about 64% of its total value.\n\nWhen I studied the numbers, I found something interesting. If someone bought just these ten stocks instead of the whole ETF, they might make more money - about 16% more. Also, these ten stocks together seemed less risky than the whole ETF.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, I needed to look at how much each stock's price usually changes. This would help show if the difference between owning the ETF and owning just the ten stocks was important.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we saw a big drop in travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the Northeast, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This might explain some of the drop. December is also when the fall school term ends, and everyone is busy with final work and grades. Many people might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December also brings busy holiday time, and students and teachers leave for a month. Many do not need to come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people wrote records that month. But this does not explain why February had such low numbers.\n\nProjects like this often start with great interest that then falls. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Ride Together Week.\" This helped get more travel records that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally lose interest, and when school breaks happen.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They like being free to go where they want, when they want. This is part of how we live. So we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave many small prizes like food cards for eating places, coffee shops, and stores in town. It would have been good to see what bigger prizes might have done - like giving away a good bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with us. The gift cards worked well at first, but if we had said in December we would give away bikes, and then in January said we would give away a special car, more people might have kept writing their travel records.",
            "I studied fifteen early films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were special films that used clever methods to create magic-like effects. Most of these films followed similar rules in how they were made. They were filmed inside, used simple camera positions, and were very short.\n\nThe camera always stayed in one place, like watching a stage play. This way of filming came from theater shows, where people sit and watch from their seats. In these films, actors usually moved from left to right across the screen. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in a film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), all the action happens from side to side.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once. The actors stayed at about the same distance from the camera throughout the film.\n\nMost of these early films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple tricks like making people or things appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. While viewers saw what looked like one continuous scene, the filmmakers actually stopped the camera and started again to create the special effects. A good example is \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you watch carefully, you can see where they stopped filming to create the effect of the execution.",
            "The old style of writing called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas. Some people liked it, while others said it had no value. The first Gothic book, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old stories with new ways of writing to create something different.\n\nGothic writing uses many ideas from the Middle Ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones.\n\nWhat made Gothic writing special was how it mixed old theater-like stories with the new way of writing books. This let readers better understand how characters thought and felt. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today, even though they are very old.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic books is the code of good behavior called \"chivalry.\" This came from the Middle Ages, when knights had to follow special rules about being brave and honest. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more of these good qualities.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his book, his country had many problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic, who shows many of the good qualities of an old-time knight. The way Walpole writes about these characters sometimes makes them seem bigger than life, which became a common way of writing Gothic stories.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping products ready, choosing where to put things, moving items around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many items to produce. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best places to make things, thinking about how much they can make and how good the products will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will do their jobs and how to keep machines working well. Every small part of making things must be carefully planned. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Wal-Mart and Target have clear plans for everything - from how workers should dress to how trucks should bring in goods. These plans help everything work smoothly.\n\nThe next important part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each factory does best and when to ask other companies for help. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one product. Leaders might ask other companies to help make things if it saves money or helps make better products faster.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often describe small details and focus on rich people's lives. However, two famous books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. These stories use mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again in his mind while trying to find help. In this part of the story, Oliver hears the voices of Sikes and Crackit, even though they are not really there. He sees lights and hears guns and shouting. Someone helps him move away, but he does not know who it is. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not go away.\n\nThis dream-like moment shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot do anything to help himself, even when he is in danger. It seems that the bad people in his life, like Fagin, have made Oliver feel hopeless. The way time passes also feels strange to Oliver - the days seem to disappear quickly, while the nights feel both very long and very short.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. While I could help with many subjects, I was best at teaching reading and writing. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading.\n\nI noticed something strange about Adrian's reading. He knew some letters well but struggled with others. He spoke English perfectly, and I knew he came from a Spanish-speaking family. One day, when most students were away on a trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish. Even with my basic Spanish, I could talk with her a little. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know English letters well.\n\nI share this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard for them. We know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, we need more than one solution. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, using only English, having special teachers, or giving extra English classes. No single way will solve everything. We need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people worry this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is not true. If we teach all children this way, everyone gains. We do not need every teacher to speak two languages. Instead, we can have special helpers who speak both languages work with the students.",
            "From when we are young, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves. Some go to religious schools, while others search for answers in different ways. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others say there is nothing beyond what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for understanding, like searching for light in the dark.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front steps, listening to rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water ran down the sides, making the plants very wet. He looked into the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were loose on him. His hair was thinner than before, too. As he kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes, I felt very alone. I was afraid and could not tell him how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real for both of us. I moved closer to him, and we both watched the rain fall in the evening light.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after I turned twenty-two. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, but kept him alive longer than doctors said he would live. I could not understand why he had to suffer more. I questioned why this happened. At night, alone, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die, so I stayed away. I could not watch the person who gave me life leave this world. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming because he thought it was the best kind of work.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country had no old rules to hold it back, which let people create a government where they could rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights that all people have. He thought these rights were all connected - if you lose one right, you lose them all. He said the government should never be able to take away these rights. Some people talked about how, in nature, strong and clever but bad people got ahead. Taylor said this must not happen in a proper society.\n\nTo make this better society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He believed very strongly that things were either right or wrong. He said that since people run governments, governments show both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from getting too powerful. He believed people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people hurt others to help themselves. We need good government to control people's bad side, but we must watch the government carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words simply, without thinking about what the writers meant, could cause problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it clearly showed that the United States was made up of separate states working together, not just one big nation.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind empty as I saw what was there. I watched without feeling, like someone who sees but does not want to understand. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind worked so well that it felt like I wasn't really thinking at all.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how our brain sees lines. One lesson tells us to put a frame around what we want to draw. This makes a complex picture, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen, become simple.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I could only stand and stare. Famous artists had their special colors - Picasso used blue, Monet liked green. If I were to call myself an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the toilet handle, my hand moving through the air as if making art. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, I pushed the handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the cleaning workers at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper.

            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and cars going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age - which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that more crashes happen when young passengers are in the car.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not allow other young people to ride with them.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies how people think believes that even age eighteen is too young to drive. He found that people under age twenty often take risks just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more deadly crashes will happen. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could lead to more deaths.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under eighteen could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for many hours before getting a full license. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would be a good way to keep young people safe.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. At that time, doctors called it by a different name. They were trying to help children who had trouble with speaking and understanding others. In 1977, many doctors met to share what they knew about CAPD and to plan new studies.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds are coming from. They may find it hard to tell different sounds apart. Some cannot understand when someone is joking by the way they speak. Others might have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person responds to different sounds. They may ask the person to complete special listening tests. The person might need to pick out specific words or numbers when hearing many sounds at once. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Doctors also do not know what causes this condition.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do my job better. These values are not just important for the job - they are important to who I am.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help people, but I was not sure how. During my school years, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some people tried to solve their problems in ways that were not good. This led me to study how people think and act in college. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nThat summer, I met a young person who was trying to get away from parents who were hurting him. When he called the police, I went to help. I talked to the police and told them about my education. They asked me to speak with the parents. The parents tried to say their son was causing trouble and making things up. After this, I knew I wanted to work helping children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, yet many people try to be like everyone else. I choose to be different. In school, I showed this by the way I looked and dressed. I joined groups that helped people who were different. I spoke up when I saw people being treated badly because of who they were. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how our bodies work and what we get from our parents. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nWhen people have trouble sleeping, doctors put these problems into different groups. The main groups are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and problems with strange things happening during sleep. Some sleep problems happen because of other health issues or because of drugs people take.\n\nNot being able to sleep well is a common problem. It can mean having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep for a month or more. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might fall asleep suddenly during the day. There are also people who walk or have bad dreams while sleeping.\n\nScientists have found that special cells in the brain control when we sleep and when we are awake. They did tests with mice to learn about these cells. They found that certain parts of brain cells help control sleep. When these parts work correctly, they help us sleep normally. If these parts do not work well, people might need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nIf someone gets these sleep problems from their parents, it can make life hard. It can cause trouble at school or work, especially when they need to focus on boring tasks. This shows how sleep problems can affect many parts of a person's life.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for more than two years. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students must use them, and the school must make it easy for people to ride bikes.\n\nA friend who just started riding bikes again told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped riding. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was very smart. Every day, I need to go to Thomas building, which takes 25 minutes to walk to from my home. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the fastest way there, can be hard to travel on.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes of my time. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, that is too much time to spend walking.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" writer Aldous Huxley shows us problems with technology and money-driven societies. He creates a future world where people think the group is more important than any single person. From birth, people are taught to seek quick happiness above everything else.\n\nThe people in this world are controlled by leaders who tell them what to think. When we look at the book through the ideas of Karl Marx, we can see Huxley was worried about how society was changing. Marx's ideas about how groups of people become the same and lose their special qualities help us understand the book's message about problems in the growing money system of Huxley's time.\n\nThe book shows how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. The common people only care about getting things for themselves. This happens because the leaders control what people think. In the book, the lower groups of people, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think for themselves. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and enjoy themselves without thinking deeply.\n\nThe higher groups, called Alpha and Beta, know more about how things work, but most do not try to change anything. Only a few people, like the character Bernard, question the way things are.\n\nIn this future world, real friendships between different kinds of people do not exist. Even the main characters in the book seem flat and simple. This might be Huxley's way of saying that technology and money-focused societies take away people's ability to be themselves. There is no real love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place in society without question. They follow orders and keep buying things, thinking this makes them better. This is exactly what Marx warned about - people being fooled into thinking they are happy while being controlled by others.",
            "I took a class about Islam at my school four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or not. This question is even more important now. Since the attacks of September 11, I have watched how news groups changed their views. At first, they were against Islam. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I had learned that Muhammad made people join his religion by force. I thought he took control of other groups and made them become Muslim. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him because they saw the truth in his words.\n\nThe book tells stories about Muhammad that are very much like stories about Jesus. For example, it says Muhammad took a small amount of food and made it bigger to feed forty men. I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a quiet, truthful man who did special things. This bothers me because it makes Jesus' life and special works seem less important. It feels like they are taking Jesus' story and using it for Muhammad.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book shows Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from the past shows he was not always gentle and quiet. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the coming years, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what Jesus really meant to teach, separate from ideas added later. This may take many years, but change will come. Christian thinking will move back toward its first form. People will remove added teachings one by one, like turning back time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different ways of thinking about Christianity, more people will share the same ideas. Groups that were different will become more alike.\n\nHistory shows us big changes can happen. The Romans once killed Christians, but later became Christian themselves. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. Christianity will also change, going back to find its true beginning. To do this, people will need to understand that Jesus often spoke in word pictures, not just plain facts.\n\nLet's look at how this all started. Before Christianity, there was only Judaism. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were not all the same. They split into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people who were the largest group.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in several ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow their business. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from big chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about how this affects people or animals. They ignore the bad smoke from their factories and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners and managers also treat their workers badly. They only care about money, not people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can tell many workers to leave their jobs without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. Managers could make people work faster and faster in unsafe places.\n\nThe book shows how the workers, mostly poor people from other countries, had to accept these terrible conditions. They had no help from the government. While there were worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the workers too. The workers were so badly treated that the book compares them to slaves. They were always close to having no food and depended completely on the cruel factory owners, just like slaves depended on their masters.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away place north of Britain. People long ago thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile this idea came from old writers, Poe likely got it from somewhere else. He read many German writers, and one of them, named Goethe, wrote about Thule too. Goethe was a famous writer who wrote a long work called \"Faust.\" Inside this work was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe's poem tells about a sad king whose wife died. She gave him a special cup before she died. After she was gone, the king drank a lot and cried when he thought about her. He gave everything he owned to his children, except the cup. Then he went to a high place above the sea, threw the cup into the water, and died.\n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" seems very much like Goethe's story. Both tell about dark, lonely places and sad memories. Poe wrote about Thule in two different works: \"Dream-Land\" and another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nThe two poems feel like they go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the writer talks about a dark place where he sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad king in Goethe's poem, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing. He would have read it because many people were making new versions of Goethe's work at that time. Also, other writers Poe liked, such as Tennyson, respected Goethe's work very much.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California.\n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled food on the floor that had not been cleaned up. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store, called D&D Markets, had five other people fall and get hurt in that same year. Palmer wants the store to pay her money for her injury. She also wants extra money to punish the store for being careless.\n\nUnder California law, a person can get extra money if they can show the other person acted very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt someone but did not care.\n\nPalmer can probably win her case for extra money because:\n1. The manager knew about the spill\n2. He was told twice about it\n3. He did nothing to clean it up\n4. Many people had fallen in his store before\n5. He chose to eat instead of keeping customers safe\n\nThe law wants store managers to keep people safe. When they know about something dangerous but do nothing, they can be made to pay extra money as punishment.",
            "She felt empty inside, wanting something she could not name. This feeling began when she was fourteen and stayed with her at seventeen. She knew she wanted to be close to someone, but no boys interested her. Several boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other girls her age. After thinking about it for years, she still had no answer. She continued to live her life while wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were peaceful people who rarely fought. They only disagreed when their daughter wanted more freedom. While her parents were calm, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to find her mother on the floor.\n\n\"Mom! What happened?\" she called out.\n\nHer mother was breathing hard and saying \"ow\" over and over. \n\n\"Please take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty.\n\n\"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, placed her carefully in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells, but she did not notice them. She was thinking only about her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Medical workers came quickly with a bed on wheels. They took her mother away for care, leaving the daughter to wait and worry.\n\nLater, she learned her mother had fallen while trying to reach a flower vase on the highest shelf.",
            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The Mediterranean diet includes lots of plant foods, fish, and healthy fats from plants. It has fewer animal products and unhealthy fats. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood tests in overweight people.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. These women were nurses working in eleven different states. None had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Every few years, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Most women stayed in the study for all twenty years.\n\nThe researchers carefully checked hospital records and death reports to confirm heart problems and strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and weight.\n\nTo get better results, they averaged each woman's eating habits over time. They also considered other things that might affect the results, such as age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 30 percent fewer heart problems than those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, Burma has been controlled by military leaders who took power by force. In 2007, many people went into the streets to protest against the government. Buddhist religious leaders wearing orange clothes led these protests. This became known as the \"Saffron Movement\" because of the color of their clothes.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. But then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news reporters from other countries from taking pictures or writing stories. They killed one news photographer from Japan just because he was watching the protests. The government said only thirteen people died. But one military leader who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nThis kind of violent control has happened many times in history. Leaders often try to stop people who disagree with them. In ancient Rome, rulers said the gods chose them to lead. In Japan, people once believed their rulers were gods.\n\nOne famous example happened in China in 1989. Many students and workers gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest against their government. The Chinese government says about 200 to 300 people died, but the Chinese Red Cross says between 2,000 and 3,000 people were killed. Another terrible event was in Rwanda in the 1990s, where one group of people tried to kill another group. And of course, there was Hitler's time in power, when many Jewish people were killed.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and was very good at writing music that showed how well each player could perform. While he played piano, his most important work was as a writer of music. He knew how to create pieces that let musicians play freely while also writing parts that needed to be played exactly as written. He understood how each player sounded and how to make them sound good together.\n\nOne of his famous pieces is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this piece, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The piece has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: A trumpet plays the main tune\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays while the piano adds soft notes\nPart 4: The whole band plays together\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others keep time\nPart 6: The voice and winds play together again, with the voice making special sounds\n\nThe piece ends with the voice running up and down and one final note from a trombone.\n\nEllington wrote other pieces that used voices in new ways. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he had a trumpet player and a singer make sounds that worked together well. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used a special way of playing the trombone to start the song. These pieces show how Ellington was very good at mixing different sounds to make interesting music.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using numbers and math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these shells grow and change from parent to child, and over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure their shapes. We put these numbers into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how the animals grow to better understand how they change over long periods.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in circles. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. The whorls can grow at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front (where you can see the aperture), and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes a series of openings that follow a path. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw this path and write it as math numbers. Once we have these numbers, we can change them to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed about the same for the past ten years. The country has made progress in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it has not made enough progress in keeping mothers and children healthy.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. But many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are seeing doctors for stomach problems. Not enough mothers get care after giving birth.\n\nSpecial operations to help mothers give birth safely happen less often than they should. Only 4 out of 100 births use this method. In cities, 7 out of 100 births use this method, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 do. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. Poor people often cannot pay for care they need.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs can show quick results and are easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When lots of money goes to one health problem, other health needs get less attention. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms, and programs often do not work well together.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different kinds. Today, there are so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each kind of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting kinds of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, people found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal, and then made even more kinds from those. This continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other kinds of music. To understand Heavy Metal today, we need to understand how it grew into more than just one kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more show on stage. The people who play Heavy Metal must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed dark feelings that most other music did not show. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first Heavy Metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and showed the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album.",
            "Many years before artists began making strange dream-like pictures, Henri Rousseau was already painting his own dreams. His famous work \"The Dream\" from 1910 shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted most - to be accepted and praised by other artists. He faced a hard choice in trying to reach this goal.\n\n\"The Dream\" shows the battle inside Rousseau: should he paint like others to be accepted, or should he follow his own special way of making art?\n\nTo understand this better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in Laval, France. His father fixed metal things and sold hardware, and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Until he was forty, he worked for the city collecting money from people at road stations. His life was very sad at times - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. To feel better, he turned to painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This wish makes sense because he started painting when he was older and never had proper training. He was making art at the same time as many famous painters.\n\nRousseau did not get much attention for his work until Henri Matisse was becoming well-known. A writer named Jan Gordon said these two artists were very different: Matisse tried hard not to paint in common ways, while Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would help him fit in with other artists.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a basic reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or personal experience. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study these things, we try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than making rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we can never fully explain why they are good. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about its colors or its place in history. But these words do not fully tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have qualities that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that we tell stories because simple statements are not enough. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. I believe the same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI think right actions and art are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way that goes beyond words. This connection is especially strong in stories and books. Unlike music or painting, writing deals directly with human actions and choices. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life, just as our own lives teach us what is right and important.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in Munich to the northern city of Kiel on the sea. You can feel this same culture from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the middle of the country, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old land of the German people was called Germania. No one knows for sure how it got this name. A writer named Tacitus said the name came from a group called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved across the Rhine River to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars with the Gauls. He got this word from the Gauls to tell the difference between the people he had won battles against and those he had not. Some think the name means \"neighbor\" in the old Gaul language. Others say it comes from their fighting stick called a \"ger,\" or from old words that meant \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the Germans were the first people in their land. He thought they did not mix with other groups. He asked why anyone would leave warm lands to come to Germania with its cold weather and dark forests, unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania. They went there to get goods and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back to Rome. The German groups began to appear about two thousand years ago. They lived near the edge of the Roman Empire, where they traded goods. Many Germans also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows us that hiding who you are can help for a while, but people must eventually show their true selves. If they do not, they might lose their real identity. However, when people stop hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between staying true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people might not mind finding out they were fooled, but others will be angry about it.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises important questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the play, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and changing her clothes helps protect her.\n\nViola, who is new to this strange land, thinks she must act like a man to stay safe from bad people. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must hide her own loving feelings for Orsino, who tells her that no woman could love him as much as she does.\n\nToday's readers might see this story differently. The play shows how hiding one's true self can help bring hidden feelings into the open, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia likes Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or if she might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare seems to be making fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and then starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "The German control of its colonies was often very harsh. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Herero and Nama people. However, how Germany ruled its colonies was different in each place. The same was true for schools in these colonies.\n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other German colonies like Kamerun also had good schools. But South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different.\n\nIn East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left teaching African people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. The government did spend much money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write.\n\nMany things made South West Africa different. This study looks at these reasons, especially how the European settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany had colonies. These early writers mostly told about how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different German colonies. They showed how each colony was different. One important writer, Cohen, studied why schools in South West Africa and East Africa were so different. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa changed how schools worked there.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this better weather, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 European people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and land in the Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many differences that caused problems. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. This is common when two countries share a border. For example, Mexico and Cuba have had long-running problems with the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relationships.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the bad feelings between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religions and kings, just as they later did not like communism in the 1900s. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about land and people crossing the border to cause trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop bad people from attacking towns across the border.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped trying to take Mexican land and instead became more interested in doing business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I had never heard of. It left me unable to work or care for myself.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose nursing because I wanted to feel safe and secure, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or news writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of living on government help for sick people, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I do not feel safe or good about myself. Nothing is sure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can be sure what will happen. Even if you get ready, some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government. It is already weak and breaking. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, instead of each person trying to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what helped our early people live through hard times was not being alone. It was being kind, showing respect, and sharing what they had. The first people who crossed the big mountains in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready. I am ready. I have things for when bad times come: medical supplies, clean water items, and tape for windows. I have lights, power supplies, matches that work in rain, and food in cans. If you have land and can grow food, that is good. If you can save food for later, that is good too. Having a wood fire for heat is smart if you do not live in a big building with many homes.\n\nBut while you do all this, make friends with the people who live near you.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealth behind and found deep understanding. His ideas led to the start of Buddhism. Today, the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. We can see this in places like Sri Lanka, where people hold special ceremonies with water each year. Both religious teachers and common people join these events. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people.\n\nThese changes affect both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community, including both teachers and followers, has had to change some of its basic ideas over time. These changes came from forces both inside and outside the religion, some friendly and some not.\n\nTo understand these changes better, we need to know some important words. Forces from inside come from Buddhist people themselves. Forces from outside come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism, while others neither help nor hurt it on purpose.\n\nAt its heart, Buddhism has some basic teachings. Buddhists believe in three important things: Buddha, his teachings (called Dhamma), and the community of Buddhist teachers (called Sangha). The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books talk about Buddha's lessons, rules for living, and deep ideas about life.\n\nThe deep ideas include beliefs like: there is no lasting soul, life includes suffering, and nothing stays the same forever. Buddhists believe that understanding these ideas can help end the cycle of being born again and again. When someone fully understands these things, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that change the mind. Religious teachers must follow many more rules.\n\nThe most important teaching in Buddhism involves four main truths: life includes suffering, wanting things causes suffering, suffering can end, and there is a way to end suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation.

            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The way people think and act in different places affects how they make deals. We cannot say all people from one country act the same way. It is wrong to think \"all Russians are hard to work with\" or \"all Japanese people are easy to work with.\" It is better to learn how people's ways of living affect how they make agreements.\n\nWhen we meet people from other places, we often compare them to what we know from our own lives. To understand people from other places, we need to learn about their history and what they believe. Instead of trying to change their ways, we should accept them. This is very important when making deals, especially if we have less power in the talks. When we go to another country to make deals, showing respect for their ways helps everyone work better together.\n\nDifferent groups have their own ways of doing things, even within the same country. Companies often have their own special ways. Some want workers to stay late at work, while others let workers go home earlier. You can see how companies are different in how workers dress, how they talk to each other, and who they choose to hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to certain groups. Even in America, companies in different cities or areas can be very different.\n\nWhat people think is important tells us why they act in certain ways. In some places, people think it is very important not to lose respect or cause trouble in public. These people will not say bad things about their company or their boss during talks. In other places, people think it is good to work hard for the best deal, so they may not want to agree quickly. It is good to think about these things before making deals. But it is also helpful to learn about the person you are dealing with as an individual.",
            "The Bible says, \"The person without wisdom says there is no God.\" This appears in Psalm 14 and starts an important discussion by two religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Both men tried to prove God exists. To compare their ideas fairly, we must accept that they speak of the God described in the Bible. While both men make good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm says. He believes that understanding God comes through faith and looking inside ourselves. He says that because we can think about God in our minds, God must exist. His idea is that proof of God is found in our own thoughts. Anselm tells us we do not need to look outside ourselves to find God. Instead, we can know God exists by thinking about what we already believe to be true. This way of believing without clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different view. He says we can prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith to believe. They could be shown God exists through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gives five ways to prove God exists. These ways look at how things change, how things are caused, why things exist, how things can be better or worse than others, and how nature works together. He shows that God must exist because the world needs God to make sense. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways to help readers understand deeper meanings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. He does this carefully so readers will connect these colors with certain feelings or ideas. This is most clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show sameness or being common. White usually means clean and rich, while gray means old or tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, often wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white in the story: Nick wears white pants to a party, Tom has on a white shirt when he meets his friend, and another woman puts white powder on her face.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show ordinary things too. Nick goes to work through white city streets. The names of party guests become gray writing in his notes. A group of houses looks like pieces of white bread all the same. Simple people and places are white or gray too: the two women had a \"white childhood,\" there are gray cars and gray land in a poor area, and even a man selling dogs is described as gray and old.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When Daisy appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps us understand why Gatsby's love for her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",
            "San Diego County grows many kinds of food because the weather is warm and sunny all year. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green leaves for food, and other vegetables. They also grow fruit from trees like peaches and lemons. They make honey and grow hot peppers too.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. They often join groups that get food directly from local farms. These farms also let people visit to see how food grows. Some farms let people walk on their land to watch birds and enjoy nature.\n\nGrowing food without chemicals helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the farm. But this kind of farming costs more money. Workers must pull out bad plants by hand and find other ways to stop insects from eating the food. Small farms also cannot save money like big farms do.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is next to a big forest called Cleveland National Forest. The land is 160 acres and has many kinds of plants growing on it. It is home to many animals that need help to survive, like special rats, frogs, and birds.\n\nLong ago, Native American people lived on this land. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood there. Someone got this land from the government back then, and people probably used it for cows and wood since that time.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked at ways the government could help a small farmer save money while helping wild animals. I also looked at another farm nearby that grows food without chemicals to see how it works.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection includes many feelings like love, pride, anger, and sometimes being mean. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, they see themselves. When times are very hard, this connection becomes most clear, whether for good or bad. These strong feelings often come with a price. Brothers must deal with what happens because of their feelings. When they look at each other, they see who they really are, not how others see them. Their true self shows in what they do and what happens after.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show these ideas. In a beautiful green place, these two boys try to do something that cannot work. One brother feels very proud but also very sad at the end, and the other brother dies. We see this through the older brother's story about Doodle, the younger brother, and how they act together. The older brother tells us his deep feelings and how he sees the world, which helps us understand why he does what he does.\n\nThe older brother does everything because of pride. From the first time he takes his little brother Doodle outside until their last walk together, he feels angry about having a weak brother. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, to climb trees with, and to swim with. But Doodle was born very sick. His heart was weak, and doctors thought he would die. He could not run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting baby Doodle once. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as people created new things, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. First, they said it was like a flat piece of wax. Later, they said it was like paper, then like a book. Now, many people say it is like a computer. However, these simple comparisons can sometimes lead people to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - like touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals in two ways. First, it builds up from small pieces of information. For example, when you see a black box on white paper, your brain first sees the color and edges. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand faster. This helps you know you are seeing a box and not a hole in the paper.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. For instance, when you look at grass, you see all of it but do not notice each piece. But if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it clearly. The brain checks what is important many times as it works with information.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are three main types of storage: quick memory (for the moment), short memory (for about 20 seconds), and long memory. When information comes in, the brain changes it into a form it can keep. Words, for example, can be stored as pictures of how they look, sounds of how they speak, or ideas of what they mean. Scientists think short memory works by signals moving in circles in the brain. Long memory might be stored in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what it knows. One idea says the brain connects things that go together. For example, in your mind, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" and \"table\" connects to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government pushed banks to do this. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped make these bad loans into complex financial products. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This hurt the whole economy.\n\nThe problems started in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes said this could cause problems if the economy became weak. He was right.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also created new ways to sell these loans to others. This meant that many parts of the economy became tied to house prices. When house prices fell, it hurt everyone.\n\nThe results were very bad. In 2007, the five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in housing debts. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank failed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to share too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or become bored.\n\nIt is better to show what happens than to just tell about it. Sometimes writers want to explain everything before getting to the interesting parts. This is not good writing. Sometimes they want to tell every small detail about every person in the story. This is also not good.\n\nWhen you tell instead of show, you are just giving facts to readers. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person lots of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to readers.\n\nHere is an example: Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. If the writer only uses a few words to tell this, readers will not care about these people. But if the writer shows how the man speaks kindly to his wife, and shows how the wife's life becomes better because of him, readers will care more. They will understand why his death makes the wife sad. They will want to know what happens to her next.\n\nWriters need to add more to their simple story ideas. Sometimes writers want to hurry and tell everything about a person right away. For example, they might want to quickly tell you that someone was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station at night, has been married two times, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and what he ate for breakfast. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only said he had hurt his wife many times and the police had caught him.\n\nThe second story told about a young man, Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I felt the story was too short, maybe because the victim was a black man in a black area. I have seen that news programs often give less time to stories about people who are not white.\n\nThey then talked about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said the shot came from a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money to find who did it.\n\nNext came news about rain and storms coming on Saturday. They said it would not be too hot that weekend. They kept this story short to make people keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. The court said he must stay in prison for 300 months. I thought it was strange they did not just say 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "I want to explain what an ETF is and study if it is a good way to invest money. An ETF is like a basket of different stocks that you can buy and sell easily. It works much like buying a single company's stock, but it contains many different companies.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you get two main good things. First, your money is spread across many companies, which makes it safer. Second, you can buy or sell it quickly, just like a regular stock. Also, ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investment choices.\n\nHowever, there are some problems. Each time you buy or sell an ETF, you must pay a small fee. But there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from, which is good.\n\nIn this study, I looked at one ETF called IHF to see if it was really as good as owning the separate stocks it contains. To make this easier to understand, I only looked at the ten biggest companies in this ETF, which make up about 64% of its total value.\n\nWhen I studied the numbers, I found something interesting. If someone bought just these ten stocks instead of the whole ETF, they might make more money - about 16% more. Also, these ten stocks together seemed less risky than the whole ETF.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, I needed to look at how much each stock's price usually changes. This would help show if the difference between owning the ETF and owning just the ten stocks was important.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we saw a big drop in travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the Northeast, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This might explain some of the drop. December is also when the fall school term ends, and everyone is busy with final work and grades. Many people might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December also brings busy holiday time, and students and teachers leave for a month. Many do not need to come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people wrote records that month. But this does not explain why February had such low numbers.\n\nProjects like this often start with great interest that then falls. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Ride Together Week.\" This helped get more travel records that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally lose interest, and when school breaks happen.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They like being free to go where they want, when they want. This is part of how we live. So we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave many small prizes like food cards for eating places, coffee shops, and stores in town. It would have been good to see what bigger prizes might have done - like giving away a good bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with us. The gift cards worked well at first, but if we had said in December we would give away bikes, and then in January said we would give away a special car, more people might have kept writing their travel records.",
            "I studied fifteen early films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were special films that used clever methods to create magic-like effects. Most of these films followed similar rules in how they were made. They were filmed inside, used simple camera positions, and were very short.\n\nThe camera always stayed in one place, like watching a stage play. This way of filming came from theater shows, where people sit and watch from their seats. In these films, actors usually moved from left to right across the screen. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in a film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), all the action happens from side to side.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once. The actors stayed at about the same distance from the camera throughout the film.\n\nMost of these early films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple tricks like making people or things appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. While viewers saw what looked like one continuous scene, the filmmakers actually stopped the camera and started again to create the special effects. A good example is \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you watch carefully, you can see where they stopped filming to create the effect of the execution.",
            "The old style of writing called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas. Some people liked it, while others said it had no value. The first Gothic book, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old stories with new ways of writing to create something different.\n\nGothic writing uses many ideas from the Middle Ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones.\n\nWhat made Gothic writing special was how it mixed old theater-like stories with the new way of writing books. This let readers better understand how characters thought and felt. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today, even though they are very old.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic books is the code of good behavior called \"chivalry.\" This came from the Middle Ages, when knights had to follow special rules about being brave and honest. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more of these good qualities.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his book, his country had many problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic, who shows many of the good qualities of an old-time knight. The way Walpole writes about these characters sometimes makes them seem bigger than life, which became a common way of writing Gothic stories.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping products ready, choosing where to put things, moving items around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many items to produce. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best places to make things, thinking about how much they can make and how good the products will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will do their jobs and how to keep machines working well. Every small part of making things must be carefully planned. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Wal-Mart and Target have clear plans for everything - from how workers should dress to how trucks should bring in goods. These plans help everything work smoothly.\n\nThe next important part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each factory does best and when to ask other companies for help. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one product. Leaders might ask other companies to help make things if it saves money or helps make better products faster.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often describe small details and focus on rich people's lives. However, two famous books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. These stories use mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again in his mind while trying to find help. In this part of the story, Oliver hears the voices of Sikes and Crackit, even though they are not really there. He sees lights and hears guns and shouting. Someone helps him move away, but he does not know who it is. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not go away.\n\nThis dream-like moment shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot do anything to help himself, even when he is in danger. It seems that the bad people in his life, like Fagin, have made Oliver feel hopeless. The way time passes also feels strange to Oliver - the days seem to disappear quickly, while the nights feel both very long and very short.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. While I could help with many subjects, I was best at teaching reading and writing. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading.\n\nI noticed something strange about Adrian's reading. He knew some letters well but struggled with others. He spoke English perfectly, and I knew he came from a Spanish-speaking family. One day, when most students were away on a trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish. Even with my basic Spanish, I could talk with her a little. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know English letters well.\n\nI share this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard for them. We know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, we need more than one solution. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, using only English, having special teachers, or giving extra English classes. No single way will solve everything. We need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people worry this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is not true. If we teach all children this way, everyone gains. We do not need every teacher to speak two languages. Instead, we can have special helpers who speak both languages work with the students.",
            "From when we are young, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves. Some go to religious schools, while others search for answers in different ways. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others say there is nothing beyond what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for understanding, like searching for light in the dark.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front steps, listening to rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water ran down the sides, making the plants very wet. He looked into the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were loose on him. His hair was thinner than before, too. As he kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes, I felt very alone. I was afraid and could not tell him how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real for both of us. I moved closer to him, and we both watched the rain fall in the evening light.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after I turned twenty-two. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, but kept him alive longer than doctors said he would live. I could not understand why he had to suffer more. I questioned why this happened. At night, alone, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die, so I stayed away. I could not watch the person who gave me life leave this world. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming because he thought it was the best kind of work.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country had no old rules to hold it back, which let people create a government where they could rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights that all people have. He thought these rights were all connected - if you lose one right, you lose them all. He said the government should never be able to take away these rights. Some people talked about how, in nature, strong and clever but bad people got ahead. Taylor said this must not happen in a proper society.\n\nTo make this better society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He believed very strongly that things were either right or wrong. He said that since people run governments, governments show both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from getting too powerful. He believed people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people hurt others to help themselves. We need good government to control people's bad side, but we must watch the government carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words simply, without thinking about what the writers meant, could cause problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it clearly showed that the United States was made up of separate states working together, not just one big nation.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind empty as I saw what was there. I watched without feeling, like someone who sees but does not want to understand. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind worked so well that it felt like I wasn't really thinking at all.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how our brain sees lines. One lesson tells us to put a frame around what we want to draw. This makes a complex picture, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen, become simple.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I could only stand and stare. Famous artists had their special colors - Picasso used blue, Monet liked green. If I were to call myself an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the toilet handle, my hand moving through the air as if making art. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, I pushed the handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the cleaning workers at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand many times until it was covered like a thick glove. Then, I bent down and reached into the bowl, like reaching into an oven for food...",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and cars going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age - which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that more crashes happen when young passengers are in the car.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not allow other young people to ride with them.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies how people think believes that even age eighteen is too young to drive. He found that people under age twenty often take risks just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more deadly crashes will happen. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could lead to more deaths.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under eighteen could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for many hours before getting a full license. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would be a good way to keep young people safe.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. At that time, doctors called it by a different name. They were trying to help children who had trouble with speaking and understanding others. In 1977, many doctors met to share what they knew about CAPD and to plan new studies.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds are coming from. They may find it hard to tell different sounds apart. Some cannot understand when someone is joking by the way they speak. Others might have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person responds to different sounds. They may ask the person to complete special listening tests. The person might need to pick out specific words or numbers when hearing many sounds at once. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Doctors also do not know what causes this condition.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do my job better. These values are not just important for the job - they are important to who I am.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help people, but I was not sure how. During my school years, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some people tried to solve their problems in ways that were not good. This led me to study how people think and act in college. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nThat summer, I met a young person who was trying to get away from parents who were hurting him. When he called the police, I went to help. I talked to the police and told them about my education. They asked me to speak with the parents. The parents tried to say their son was causing trouble and making things up. After this, I knew I wanted to work helping children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, yet many people try to be like everyone else. I choose to be different. In school, I showed this by the way I looked and dressed. I joined groups that helped people who were different. I spoke up when I saw people being treated badly because of who they were. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how our bodies work and what we get from our parents. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nWhen people have trouble sleeping, doctors put these problems into different groups. The main groups are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and problems with strange things happening during sleep. Some sleep problems happen because of other health issues or because of drugs people take.\n\nNot being able to sleep well is a common problem. It can mean having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep for a month or more. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might fall asleep suddenly during the day. There are also people who walk or have bad dreams while sleeping.\n\nScientists have found that special cells in the brain control when we sleep and when we are awake. They did tests with mice to learn about these cells. They found that certain parts of brain cells help control sleep. When these parts work correctly, they help us sleep normally. If these parts do not work well, people might need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nIf someone gets these sleep problems from their parents, it can make life hard. It can cause trouble at school or work, especially when they need to focus on boring tasks. This shows how sleep problems can affect many parts of a person's life.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for more than two years. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students must use them, and the school must make it easy for people to ride bikes.\n\nA friend who just started riding bikes again told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped riding. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was very smart. Every day, I need to go to Thomas building, which takes 25 minutes to walk to from my home. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the fastest way there, can be hard to travel on.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes of my time. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, that is too much time to spend walking.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" writer Aldous Huxley shows us problems with technology and money-driven societies. He creates a future world where people think the group is more important than any single person. From birth, people are taught to seek quick happiness above everything else.\n\nThe people in this world are controlled by leaders who tell them what to think. When we look at the book through the ideas of Karl Marx, we can see Huxley was worried about how society was changing. Marx's ideas about how groups of people become the same and lose their special qualities help us understand the book's message about problems in the growing money system of Huxley's time.\n\nThe book shows how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. The common people only care about getting things for themselves. This happens because the leaders control what people think. In the book, the lower groups of people, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think for themselves. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and enjoy themselves without thinking deeply.\n\nThe higher groups, called Alpha and Beta, know more about how things work, but most do not try to change anything. Only a few people, like the character Bernard, question the way things are.\n\nIn this future world, real friendships between different kinds of people do not exist. Even the main characters in the book seem flat and simple. This might be Huxley's way of saying that technology and money-focused societies take away people's ability to be themselves. There is no real love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place in society without question. They follow orders and keep buying things, thinking this makes them better. This is exactly what Marx warned about - people being fooled into thinking they are happy while being controlled by others.",
            "I took a class about Islam at my school four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or not. This question is even more important now. Since the attacks of September 11, I have watched how news groups changed their views. At first, they were against Islam. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I had learned that Muhammad made people join his religion by force. I thought he took control of other groups and made them become Muslim. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him because they saw the truth in his words.\n\nThe book tells stories about Muhammad that are very much like stories about Jesus. For example, it says Muhammad took a small amount of food and made it bigger to feed forty men. I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a quiet, truthful man who did special things. This bothers me because it makes Jesus' life and special works seem less important. It feels like they are taking Jesus' story and using it for Muhammad.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book shows Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from the past shows he was not always gentle and quiet. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the coming years, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what Jesus really meant to teach, separate from ideas added later. This may take many years, but change will come. Christian thinking will move back toward its first form. People will remove added teachings one by one, like turning back time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different ways of thinking about Christianity, more people will share the same ideas. Groups that were different will become more alike.\n\nHistory shows us big changes can happen. The Romans once killed Christians, but later became Christian themselves. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. Christianity will also change, going back to find its true beginning. To do this, people will need to understand that Jesus often spoke in word pictures, not just plain facts.\n\nLet's look at how this all started. Before Christianity, there was only Judaism. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were not all the same. They split into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people who were the largest group.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in several ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow their business. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from big chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about how this affects people or animals. They ignore the bad smoke from their factories and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners and managers also treat their workers badly. They only care about money, not people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can tell many workers to leave their jobs without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. Managers could make people work faster and faster in unsafe places.\n\nThe book shows how the workers, mostly poor people from other countries, had to accept these terrible conditions. They had no help from the government. While there were worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the workers too. The workers were so badly treated that the book compares them to slaves. They were always close to having no food and depended completely on the cruel factory owners, just like slaves depended on their masters.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away place north of Britain. People long ago thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile this idea came from old writers, Poe likely got it from somewhere else. He read many German writers, and one of them, named Goethe, wrote about Thule too. Goethe was a famous writer who wrote a long work called \"Faust.\" Inside this work was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe's poem tells about a sad king whose wife died. She gave him a special cup before she died. After she was gone, the king drank a lot and cried when he thought about her. He gave everything he owned to his children, except the cup. Then he went to a high place above the sea, threw the cup into the water, and died.\n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" seems very much like Goethe's story. Both tell about dark, lonely places and sad memories. Poe wrote about Thule in two different works: \"Dream-Land\" and another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nThe two poems feel like they go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the writer talks about a dark place where he sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad king in Goethe's poem, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing. He would have read it because many people were making new versions of Goethe's work at that time. Also, other writers Poe liked, such as Tennyson, respected Goethe's work very much.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California.\n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled food on the floor that had not been cleaned up. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store, called D&D Markets, had five other people fall and get hurt in that same year. Palmer wants the store to pay her money for her injury. She also wants extra money to punish the store for being careless.\n\nUnder California law, a person can get extra money if they can show the other person acted very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt someone but did not care.\n\nPalmer can probably win her case for extra money because:\n1. The manager knew about the spill\n2. He was told twice about it\n3. He did nothing to clean it up\n4. Many people had fallen in his store before\n5. He chose to eat instead of keeping customers safe\n\nThe law wants store managers to keep people safe. When they know about something dangerous but do nothing, they can be made to pay extra money as punishment.",
            "She felt empty inside, wanting something she could not name. This feeling began when she was fourteen and stayed with her at seventeen. She knew she wanted to be close to someone, but no boys interested her. Several boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other girls her age. After thinking about it for years, she still had no answer. She continued to live her life while wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were peaceful people who rarely fought. They only disagreed when their daughter wanted more freedom. While her parents were calm, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to find her mother on the floor.\n\n\"Mom! What happened?\" she called out.\n\nHer mother was breathing hard and saying \"ow\" over and over. \n\n\"Please take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty.\n\n\"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, placed her carefully in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells, but she did not notice them. She was thinking only about her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Medical workers came quickly with a bed on wheels.

            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The Mediterranean diet includes lots of plant foods, fish, and healthy fats from plants. It has fewer animal products and unhealthy fats. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood tests in overweight people.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. These women were nurses working in eleven different states. None had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Every few years, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Most women stayed in the study for all twenty years.\n\nThe researchers carefully checked hospital records and death reports to confirm heart problems and strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and weight.\n\nTo get better results, they averaged each woman's eating habits over time. They also considered other things that might affect the results, such as age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 30 percent fewer heart problems than those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, Burma has been controlled by military leaders who took power by force. In 2007, many people went into the streets to protest against the government. Buddhist religious leaders wearing orange clothes led these protests. This became known as the \"Saffron Movement\" because of the color of their clothes.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. But then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news reporters from other countries from taking pictures or writing stories. They killed one news photographer from Japan just because he was watching the protests. The government said only thirteen people died. But one military leader who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nThis kind of violent control has happened many times in history. Leaders often try to stop people who disagree with them. In ancient Rome, rulers said the gods chose them to lead. In Japan, people once believed their rulers were gods.\n\nOne famous example happened in China in 1989. Many students and workers gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest against their government. The Chinese government says about 200 to 300 people died, but the Chinese Red Cross says between 2,000 and 3,000 people were killed. Another terrible event was in Rwanda in the 1990s, where one group of people tried to kill another group. And of course, there was Hitler's time in power, when many Jewish people were killed.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and was very good at writing music that showed how well each player could perform. While he played piano, his most important work was as a writer of music. He knew how to create pieces that let musicians play freely while also writing parts that needed to be played exactly as written. He understood how each player sounded and how to make them sound good together.\n\nOne of his famous pieces is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this piece, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The piece has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: A trumpet plays the main tune\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays while the piano adds soft notes\nPart 4: The whole band plays together\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others keep time\nPart 6: The voice and winds play together again, with the voice making special sounds\n\nThe piece ends with the voice running up and down and one final note from a trombone.\n\nEllington wrote other pieces that used voices in new ways. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he had a trumpet player and a singer make sounds that worked together well. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used a special way of playing the trombone to start the song. These pieces show how Ellington was very good at mixing different sounds to make interesting music.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using numbers and math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these shells grow and change from parent to child, and over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure their shapes. We put these numbers into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how the animals grow to better understand how they change over long periods.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in circles. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. The whorls can grow at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front (where you can see the aperture), and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes a series of openings that follow a path. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw this path and write it as math numbers. Once we have these numbers, we can change them to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed about the same for the past ten years. The country has made progress in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it has not made enough progress in keeping mothers and children healthy.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. But many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are seeing doctors for stomach problems. Not enough mothers get care after giving birth.\n\nSpecial operations to help mothers give birth safely happen less often than they should. Only 4 out of 100 births use this method. In cities, 7 out of 100 births use this method, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 do. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. Poor people often cannot pay for care they need.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs can show quick results and are easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When lots of money goes to one health problem, other health needs get less attention. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms, and programs often do not work well together.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different kinds. Today, there are so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each kind of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting kinds of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, people found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal, and then made even more kinds from those. This continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other kinds of music. To understand Heavy Metal today, we need to understand how it grew into more than just one kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more show on stage. The people who play Heavy Metal must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed dark feelings that most other music did not show. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first Heavy Metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and showed the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album.",

The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted most - to be accepted and praised by other artists. He faced a hard choice in trying to reach this goal.\n\n\"The Dream\" shows the battle inside Rousseau: should he paint like others to be accepted, or should he follow his own special way of making art?\n\nTo understand this better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in Laval, France. His father fixed metal things and sold hardware, and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Until he was forty, he worked for the city collecting money from people at road stations. His life was very sad at times - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. To feel better, he turned to painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This wish makes sense because he started painting when he was older and never had proper training. He was making art at the same time as many famous painters.\n\nRousseau did not get much attention for his work until Henri Matisse was becoming well-known. A writer named Jan Gordon said these two artists were very different: Matisse tried hard not to paint in common ways, while Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would help him fit in with other artists.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a basic reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or personal experience. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study these things, we try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than making rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we can never fully explain why they are good. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about its colors or its place in history. But these words do not fully tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have qualities that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that we tell stories because simple statements are not enough. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. I believe the same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI think right actions and art are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way that goes beyond words. This connection is especially strong in stories and books. Unlike music or painting, writing deals directly with human actions and choices. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life, just as our own lives teach us what is right and important.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in Munich to the northern city of Kiel on the sea. You can feel this same culture from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the middle of the country, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old land of the German people was called Germania. No one knows for sure how it got this name. A writer named Tacitus said the name came from a group called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved across the Rhine River to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars with the Gauls. He got this word from the Gauls to tell the difference between the people he had won battles against and those he had not. Some think the name means \"neighbor\" in the old Gaul language. Others say it comes from their fighting stick called a \"ger,\" or from old words that meant \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the Germans were the first people in their land. He thought they did not mix with other groups. He asked why anyone would leave warm lands to come to Germania with its cold weather and dark forests, unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania. They went there to get goods and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back to Rome. The German groups began to appear about two thousand years ago. They lived near the edge of the Roman Empire, where they traded goods. Many Germans also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows us that hiding who you are can help for a while, but people must eventually show their true selves. If they do not, they might lose their real identity. However, when people stop hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between staying true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people might not mind finding out they were fooled, but others will be angry about it.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises important questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the play, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and changing her clothes helps protect her.\n\nViola, who is new to this strange land, thinks she must act like a man to stay safe from bad people. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must hide her own loving feelings for Orsino, who tells her that no woman could love him as much as she does.\n\nToday's readers might see this story differently. The play shows how hiding one's true self can help bring hidden feelings into the open, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia likes Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or if she might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare seems to be making fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and then starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "The German control of its colonies was often very harsh. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Herero and Nama people. However, how Germany ruled its colonies was different in each place. The same was true for schools in these colonies.\n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other German colonies like Kamerun also had good schools. But South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different.\n\nIn East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left teaching African people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. The government did spend much money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write.\n\nMany things made South West Africa different. This study looks at these reasons, especially how the European settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany had colonies. These early writers mostly told about how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different German colonies. They showed how each colony was different. One important writer, Cohen, studied why schools in South West Africa and East Africa were so different. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa changed how schools worked there.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this better weather, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 European people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and land in the Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many differences that caused problems. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. This is common when two countries share a border. For example, Mexico and Cuba have had long-running problems with the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relationships.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the bad feelings between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religions and kings, just as they later did not like communism in the 1900s. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about land and people crossing the border to cause trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop bad people from attacking towns across the border.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped trying to take Mexican land and instead became more interested in doing business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I had never heard of. It left me unable to work or care for myself.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose nursing because I wanted to feel safe and secure, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or news writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of living on government help for sick people, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I do not feel safe or good about myself. Nothing is sure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can be sure what will happen. Even if you get ready, some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government. It is already weak and breaking. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, instead of each person trying to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what helped our early people live through hard times was not being alone. It was being kind, showing respect, and sharing what they had. The first people who crossed the big mountains in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready. I am ready. I have things for when bad times come: medical supplies, clean water items, and tape for windows. I have lights, power supplies, matches that work in rain, and food in cans. If you have land and can grow food, that is good. If you can save food for later, that is good too. Having a wood fire for heat is smart if you do not live in a big building with many homes.\n\nBut while you do all this, make friends with the people who live near you.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealth behind and found deep understanding. His ideas led to the start of Buddhism. Today, the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. We can see this in places like Sri Lanka, where people hold special ceremonies with water each year. Both religious teachers and common people join these events. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people.\n\nThese changes affect both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community, including both teachers and followers, has had to change some of its basic ideas over time. These changes came from forces both inside and outside the religion, some friendly and some not.\n\nTo understand these changes better, we need to know some important words. Forces from inside come from Buddhist people themselves. Forces from outside come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism, while others neither help nor hurt it on purpose.\n\nAt its heart, Buddhism has some basic teachings. Buddhists believe in three important things: Buddha, his teachings (called Dhamma), and the community of Buddhist teachers (called Sangha). The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books talk about Buddha's lessons, rules for living, and deep ideas about life.\n\nThe deep ideas include beliefs like: there is no lasting soul, life includes suffering, and nothing stays the same forever. Buddhists believe that understanding these ideas can help end the cycle of being born again and again. When someone fully understands these things, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that change the mind. Religious teachers must follow many more rules.\n\nThe most important teaching in Buddhism involves four main truths: life includes suffering, wanting things causes suffering, suffering can end, and there is a way to end suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The way people think and act in different places affects how they make deals. We cannot say all people from one country act the same way. It is wrong to think \"all Russians are hard to work with\" or \"all Japanese people are easy to work with.\" It is better to learn how people's ways of living affect how they make agreements.\n\nWhen we meet people from other places, we often compare them to what we know from our own lives. To understand people from other places, we need to learn about their history and what they believe. Instead of trying to change their ways, we should accept them. This is very important when making deals, especially if we have less power in the talks. When we go to another country to make deals, showing respect for their ways helps everyone work better together.\n\nDifferent groups have their own ways of doing things, even within the same country. Companies often have their own special ways. Some want workers to stay late at work, while others let workers go home earlier. You can see how companies are different in how workers dress, how they talk to each other, and who they choose to hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to certain groups. Even in America, companies in different cities or areas can be very different.\n\nWhat people think is important tells us why they act in certain ways. In some places, people think it is very important not to lose respect or cause trouble in public. These people will not say bad things about their company or their boss during talks. In other places, people think it is good to work hard for the best deal, so they may not want to agree quickly. It is good to think about these things before making deals. But it is also helpful to learn about the person you are dealing with as an individual.",
            "The Bible says, \"The person without wisdom says there is no God.\" This appears in Psalm 14 and starts an important discussion by two religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. Both men tried to prove God exists. To compare their ideas fairly, we must accept that they speak of the God described in the Bible. While both men make good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm says. He believes that understanding God comes through faith and looking inside ourselves. He says that because we can think about God in our minds, God must exist. His idea is that proof of God is found in our own thoughts. Anselm tells us we do not need to look outside ourselves to find God. Instead, we can know God exists by thinking about what we already believe to be true. This way of believing without clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different view. He says we can prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith to believe. They could be shown God exists through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gives five ways to prove God exists. These ways look at how things change, how things are caused, why things exist, how things can be better or worse than others, and how nature works together. He shows that God must exist because the world needs God to make sense. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways to help readers understand deeper meanings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. He does this carefully so readers will connect these colors with certain feelings or ideas. This is most clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show sameness or being common. White usually means clean and rich, while gray means old or tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, often wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white in the story: Nick wears white pants to a party, Tom has on a white shirt when he meets his friend, and another woman puts white powder on her face.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show ordinary things too. Nick goes to work through white city streets. The names of party guests become gray writing in his notes. A group of houses looks like pieces of white bread all the same. Simple people and places are white or gray too: the two women had a \"white childhood,\" there are gray cars and gray land in a poor area, and even a man selling dogs is described as gray and old.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When Daisy appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps us understand why Gatsby's love for her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",
            "San Diego County grows many kinds of food because the weather is warm and sunny all year. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green leaves for food, and other vegetables. They also grow fruit from trees like peaches and lemons. They make honey and grow hot peppers too.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. They often join groups that get food directly from local farms. These farms also let people visit to see how food grows. Some farms let people walk on their land to watch birds and enjoy nature.\n\nGrowing food without chemicals helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the farm. But this kind of farming costs more money. Workers must pull out bad plants by hand and find other ways to stop insects from eating the food. Small farms also cannot save money like big farms do.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is next to a big forest called Cleveland National Forest. The land is 160 acres and has many kinds of plants growing on it. It is home to many animals that need help to survive, like special rats, frogs, and birds.\n\nLong ago, Native American people lived on this land. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood there. Someone got this land from the government back then, and people probably used it for cows and wood since that time.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked at ways the government could help a small farmer save money while helping wild animals. I also looked at another farm nearby that grows food without chemicals to see how it works.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection includes many feelings like love, pride, anger, and sometimes being mean. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, they see themselves. When times are very hard, this connection becomes most clear, whether for good or bad. These strong feelings often come with a price. Brothers must deal with what happens because of their feelings. When they look at each other, they see who they really are, not how others see them. Their true self shows in what they do and what happens after.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show these ideas. In a beautiful green place, these two boys try to do something that cannot work. One brother feels very proud but also very sad at the end, and the other brother dies. We see this through the older brother's story about Doodle, the younger brother, and how they act together. The older brother tells us his deep feelings and how he sees the world, which helps us understand why he does what he does.\n\nThe older brother does everything because of pride. From the first time he takes his little brother Doodle outside until their last walk together, he feels angry about having a weak brother. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, to climb trees with, and to swim with. But Doodle was born very sick. His heart was weak, and doctors thought he would die. He could not run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting baby Doodle once. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as people created new things, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. First, they said it was like a flat piece of wax. Later, they said it was like paper, then like a book. Now, many people say it is like a computer. However, these simple comparisons can sometimes lead people to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - like touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals in two ways. First, it builds up from small pieces of information. For example, when you see a black box on white paper, your brain first sees the color and edges. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand faster. This helps you know you are seeing a box and not a hole in the paper.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. For instance, when you look at grass, you see all of it but do not notice each piece. But if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it clearly. The brain checks what is important many times as it works with information.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are three main types of storage: quick memory (for the moment), short memory (for about 20 seconds), and long memory. When information comes in, the brain changes it into a form it can keep. Words, for example, can be stored as pictures of how they look, sounds of how they speak, or ideas of what they mean. Scientists think short memory works by signals moving in circles in the brain. Long memory might be stored in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what it knows. One idea says the brain connects things that go together. For example, in your mind, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" and \"table\" connects to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government pushed banks to do this. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped make these bad loans into complex financial products. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This hurt the whole economy.\n\nThe problems started in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes said this could cause problems if the economy became weak. He was right.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also created new ways to sell these loans to others. This meant that many parts of the economy became tied to house prices. When house prices fell, it hurt everyone.\n\nThe results were very bad. In 2007, the five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in housing debts. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank failed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to share too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or become bored.\n\nIt is better to show what happens than to just tell about it. Sometimes writers want to explain everything before getting to the interesting parts. This is not good writing. Sometimes they want to tell every small detail about every person in the story. This is also not good.\n\nWhen you tell instead of show, you are just giving facts to readers. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person lots of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to readers.\n\nHere is an example: Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. If the writer only uses a few words to tell this, readers will not care about these people. But if the writer shows how the man speaks kindly to his wife, and shows how the wife's life becomes better because of him, readers will care more. They will understand why his death makes the wife sad. They will want to know what happens to her next.\n\nWriters need to add more to their simple story ideas. Sometimes writers want to hurry and tell everything about a person right away. For example, they might want to quickly tell you that someone was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station at night, has been married two times, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and what he ate for breakfast. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only said he had hurt his wife many times and the police had caught him.\n\nThe second story told about a young man, Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I felt the story was too short, maybe because the victim was a black man in a black area. I have seen that news programs often give less time to stories about people who are not white.\n\nThey then talked about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said the shot came from a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money to find who did it.\n\nNext came news about rain and storms coming on Saturday. They said it would not be too hot that weekend. They kept this story short to make people keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. The court said he must stay in prison for 300 months. I thought it was strange they did not just say 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "I want to explain what an ETF is and study if it is a good way to invest money. An ETF is like a basket of different stocks that you can buy and sell easily. It works much like buying a single company's stock, but it contains many different companies.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you get two main good things. First, your money is spread across many companies, which makes it safer. Second, you can buy or sell it quickly, just like a regular stock. Also, ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investment choices.\n\nHowever, there are some problems. Each time you buy or sell an ETF, you must pay a small fee. But there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from, which is good.\n\nIn this study, I looked at one ETF called IHF to see if it was really as good as owning the separate stocks it contains. To make this easier to understand, I only looked at the ten biggest companies in this ETF, which make up about 64% of its total value.\n\nWhen I studied the numbers, I found something interesting. If someone bought just these ten stocks instead of the whole ETF, they might make more money - about 16% more. Also, these ten stocks together seemed less risky than the whole ETF.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, I needed to look at how much each stock's price usually changes. This would help show if the difference between owning the ETF and owning just the ten stocks was important.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we saw a big drop in travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the Northeast, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This might explain some of the drop. December is also when the fall school term ends, and everyone is busy with final work and grades. Many people might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December also brings busy holiday time, and students and teachers leave for a month. Many do not need to come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people wrote records that month. But this does not explain why February had such low numbers.\n\nProjects like this often start with great interest that then falls. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Ride Together Week.\" This helped get more travel records that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally lose interest, and when school breaks happen.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They like being free to go where they want, when they want. This is part of how we live. So we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave many small prizes like food cards for eating places, coffee shops, and stores in town. It would have been good to see what bigger prizes might have done - like giving away a good bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with us. The gift cards worked well at first, but if we had said in December we would give away bikes, and then in January said we would give away a special car, more people might have kept writing their travel records.",
            "I studied fifteen early films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were special films that used clever methods to create magic-like effects. Most of these films followed similar rules in how they were made. They were filmed inside, used simple camera positions, and were very short.\n\nThe camera always stayed in one place, like watching a stage play. This way of filming came from theater shows, where people sit and watch from their seats. In these films, actors usually moved from left to right across the screen. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in a film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), all the action happens from side to side.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once. The actors stayed at about the same distance from the camera throughout the film.\n\nMost of these early films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple tricks like making people or things appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. While viewers saw what looked like one continuous scene, the filmmakers actually stopped the camera and started again to create the special effects. A good example is \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you watch carefully, you can see where they stopped filming to create the effect of the execution.",
            "The old style of writing called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas. Some people liked it, while others said it had no value. The first Gothic book, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old stories with new ways of writing to create something different.\n\nGothic writing uses many ideas from the Middle Ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones.\n\nWhat made Gothic writing special was how it mixed old theater-like stories with the new way of writing books. This let readers better understand how characters thought and felt. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today, even though they are very old.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic books is the code of good behavior called \"chivalry.\" This came from the Middle Ages, when knights had to follow special rules about being brave and honest. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more of these good qualities.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his book, his country had many problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic, who shows many of the good qualities of an old-time knight. The way Walpole writes about these characters sometimes makes them seem bigger than life, which became a common way of writing Gothic stories.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping products ready, choosing where to put things, moving items around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many items to produce. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best places to make things, thinking about how much they can make and how good the products will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will do their jobs and how to keep machines working well. Every small part of making things must be carefully planned. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Wal-Mart and Target have clear plans for everything - from how workers should dress to how trucks should bring in goods. These plans help everything work smoothly.\n\nThe next important part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each factory does best and when to ask other companies for help. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one product. Leaders might ask other companies to help make things if it saves money or helps make better products faster.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often describe small details and focus on rich people's lives. However, two famous books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. These stories use mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again in his mind while trying to find help. In this part of the story, Oliver hears the voices of Sikes and Crackit, even though they are not really there. He sees lights and hears guns and shouting. Someone helps him move away, but he does not know who it is. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not go away.\n\nThis dream-like moment shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot do anything to help himself, even when he is in danger. It seems that the bad people in his life, like Fagin, have made Oliver feel hopeless. The way time passes also feels strange to Oliver - the days seem to disappear quickly, while the nights feel both very long and very short.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. While I could help with many subjects, I was best at teaching reading and writing. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading.\n\nI noticed something strange about Adrian's reading. He knew some letters well but struggled with others. He spoke English perfectly, and I knew he came from a Spanish-speaking family. One day, when most students were away on a trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish. Even with my basic Spanish, I could talk with her a little. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know English letters well.\n\nI share this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard for them. We know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, we need more than one solution. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, using only English, having special teachers, or giving extra English classes. No single way will solve everything. We need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people worry this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is not true. If we teach all children this way, everyone gains. We do not need every teacher to speak two languages. Instead, we can have special helpers who speak both languages work with the students.",
            "From when we are young, most of us learn about something greater than ourselves. Some go to religious schools, while others search for answers in different ways. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others say there is nothing beyond what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for understanding, like searching for light in the dark.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front steps, listening to rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water ran down the sides, making the plants very wet. He looked into the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were loose on him. His hair was thinner than before, too. As he kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes, I felt very alone. I was afraid and could not tell him how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real for both of us. I moved closer to him, and we both watched the rain fall in the evening light.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after I turned twenty-two. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, but kept him alive longer than doctors said he would live. I could not understand why he had to suffer more. I questioned why this happened. At night, alone, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die, so I stayed away. I could not watch the person who gave me life leave this world. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want his only child to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming because he thought it was the best kind of work.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country had no old rules to hold it back, which let people create a government where they could rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights that all people have. He thought these rights were all connected - if you lose one right, you lose them all. He said the government should never be able to take away these rights. Some people talked about how, in nature, strong and clever but bad people got ahead. Taylor said this must not happen in a proper society.\n\nTo make this better society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He believed very strongly that things were either right or wrong. He said that since people run governments, governments show both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from getting too powerful. He believed people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people hurt others to help themselves. We need good government to control people's bad side, but we must watch the government carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words simply, without thinking about what the writers meant, could cause problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it clearly showed that the United States was made up of separate states working together, not just one big nation.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind empty as I saw what was there. I watched without feeling, like someone who sees but does not want to understand. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind worked so well that it felt like I wasn't really thinking at all.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how our brain sees lines. One lesson tells us to put a frame around what we want to draw. This makes a complex picture, like a fruit bowl in a kitchen, become simple.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I could only stand and stare. Famous artists had their special colors - Picasso used blue, Monet liked green. If I were to call myself an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the toilet handle, my hand moving through the air as if making art. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, I pushed the handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the cleaning workers at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand many times until it was covered like a thick glove. Then, I bent down and reached into the bowl, like reaching into an oven for food...",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and cars going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age - which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that more crashes happen when young passengers are in the car.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not allow other young people to ride with them.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies how people think believes that even age eighteen is too young to drive. He found that people under age twenty often take risks just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more deadly crashes will happen. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could lead to more deaths.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under eighteen could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for many hours before getting a full license. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would be a good way to keep young people safe.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. At that time, doctors called it by a different name. They were trying to help children who had trouble with speaking and understanding others. In 1977, many doctors met to share what they knew about CAPD and to plan new studies.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds are coming from. They may find it hard to tell different sounds apart. Some cannot understand when someone is joking by the way they speak. Others might have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person responds to different sounds. They may ask the person to complete special listening tests. The person might need to pick out specific words or numbers when hearing many sounds at once. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Doctors also do not know what causes this condition.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do my job better. These values are not just important for the job - they are important to who I am.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help people, but I was not sure how. During my school years, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some people tried to solve their problems in ways that were not good. This led me to study how people think and act in college. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nThat summer, I met a young person who was trying to get away from parents who were hurting him. When he called the police, I went to help. I talked to the police and told them about my education. They asked me to speak with the parents. The parents tried to say their son was causing trouble and making things up. After this, I knew I wanted to work helping children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, yet many people try to be like everyone else. I choose to be different. In school, I showed this by the way I looked and dressed. I joined groups that helped people who were different. I spoke up when I saw people being treated badly because of who they were. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how our bodies work and what we get from our parents. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nWhen people have trouble sleeping, doctors put these problems into different groups. The main groups are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and problems with strange things happening during sleep. Some sleep problems happen because of other health issues or because of drugs people take.\n\nNot being able to sleep well is a common problem. It can mean having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep for a month or more. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might fall asleep suddenly during the day. There are also people who walk or have bad dreams while sleeping.\n\nScientists have found that special cells in the brain control when we sleep and when we are awake. They did tests with mice to learn about these cells. They found that certain parts of brain cells help control sleep. When these parts work correctly, they help us sleep normally. If these parts do not work well, people might need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nIf someone gets these sleep problems from their parents, it can make life hard. It can cause trouble at school or work, especially when they need to focus on boring tasks. This shows how sleep problems can affect many parts of a person's life.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for more than two years. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students must use them, and the school must make it easy for people to ride bikes.\n\nA friend who just started riding bikes again told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped riding. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was very smart. Every day, I need to go to Thomas building, which takes 25 minutes to walk to from my home. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the fastest way there, can be hard to travel on.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes of my time. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, that is too much time to spend walking.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" writer Aldous Huxley shows us problems with technology and money-driven societies. He creates a future world where people think the group is more important than any single person. From birth, people are taught to seek quick happiness above everything else.\n\nThe people in this world are controlled by leaders who tell them what to think. When we look at the book through the ideas of Karl Marx, we can see Huxley was worried about how society was changing. Marx's ideas about how groups of people become the same and lose their special qualities help us understand the book's message about problems in the growing money system of Huxley's time.\n\nThe book shows how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. The common people only care about getting things for themselves. This happens because the leaders control what people think. In the book, the lower groups of people, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think for themselves. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and enjoy themselves without thinking deeply.\n\nThe higher groups, called Alpha and Beta, know more about how things work, but most do not try to change anything. Only a few people, like the character Bernard, question the way things are.\n\nIn this future world, real friendships between different kinds of people do not exist. Even the main characters in the book seem flat and simple. This might be Huxley's way of saying that technology and money-focused societies take away people's ability to be themselves. There is no real love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place in society without question. They follow orders and keep buying things, thinking this makes them better. This is exactly what Marx warned about - people being fooled into thinking they are happy while being controlled by others.",
            "I took a class about Islam at my school four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or not. This question is even more important now. Since the attacks of September 11, I have watched how news groups changed their views. At first, they were against Islam. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I had learned that Muhammad made people join his religion by force. I thought he took control of other groups and made them become Muslim. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him because they saw the truth in his words.\n\nThe book tells stories about Muhammad that are very much like stories about Jesus. For example, it says Muhammad took a small amount of food and made it bigger to feed forty men. I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a quiet, truthful man who did special things. This bothers me because it makes Jesus' life and special works seem less important. It feels like they are taking Jesus' story and using it for Muhammad.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book shows Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from the past shows he was not always gentle and quiet. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the coming years, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what Jesus really meant to teach, separate from ideas added later. This may take many years, but change will come. Christian thinking will move back toward its first form. People will remove added teachings one by one, like turning back time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different ways of thinking about Christianity, more people will share the same ideas. Groups that were different will become more alike.\n\nHistory shows us big changes can happen. The Romans once killed Christians, but later became Christian themselves. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. Christianity will also change, going back to find its true beginning. To do this, people will need to understand that Jesus often spoke in word pictures, not just plain facts.\n\nLet's look at how this all started. Before Christianity, there was only Judaism. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were not all the same. They split into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people who were the largest group.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in several ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow their business. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from big chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about how this affects people or animals. They ignore the bad smoke from their factories and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners and managers also treat their workers badly. They only care about money, not people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can tell many workers to leave their jobs without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. Managers could make people work faster and faster in unsafe places.\n\nThe book shows how the workers, mostly poor people from other countries, had to accept these terrible conditions. They had no help from the government. While there were worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the workers too. The workers were so badly treated that the book compares them to slaves. They were always close to having no food and depended completely on the cruel factory owners, just like slaves depended on their masters.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away place north of Britain. People long ago thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile this idea came from old writers, Poe likely got it from somewhere else. He read many German writers, and one of them, named Goethe, wrote about Thule too. Goethe was a famous writer who wrote a long work called \"Faust.\" Inside this work was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe's poem tells about a sad king whose wife died. She gave him a special cup before she died. After she was gone, the king drank a lot and cried when he thought about her. He gave everything he owned to his children, except the cup. Then he went to a high place above the sea, threw the cup into the water, and died.\n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" seems very much like Goethe's story. Both tell about dark, lonely places and sad memories. Poe wrote about Thule in two different works: \"Dream-Land\" and another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nThe two poems feel like they go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the writer talks about a dark place where he sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad king in Goethe's poem, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing. He would have read it because many people were making new versions of Goethe's work at that time. Also, other writers Poe liked, such as Tennyson, respected Goethe's work very much.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California.\n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled food on the floor that had not been cleaned up. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store, called D&D Markets, had five other people fall and get hurt in that same year. Palmer wants the store to pay her money for her injury. She also wants extra money to punish the store for being careless.\n\nUnder California law, a person can get extra money if they can show the other person acted very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt someone but did not care.\n\nPalmer can probably win her case for extra money because:\n1. The manager knew about the spill\n2. He was told twice about it\n3. He did nothing to clean it up\n4. Many people had fallen in his store before\n5. He chose to eat instead of keeping customers safe\n\nThe law wants store managers to keep people safe. When they know about something dangerous but do nothing, they can be made to pay extra money as punishment.",
            "She felt empty inside, wanting something she could not name. This feeling began when she was fourteen and stayed with her at seventeen. She knew she wanted to be close to someone, but no boys interested her. Several boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other girls her age. After thinking about it for years, she still had no answer. She continued to live her life while wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were peaceful people who rarely fought. They only disagreed when their daughter wanted more freedom. While her parents were calm, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to find her mother on the floor.\n\n\"Mom! What happened?\" she called out.\n\nHer mother was breathing hard and saying \"ow\" over and over. \n\n\"Please take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty.\n\n\"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, placed her carefully in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells, but she did not notice them. She was thinking only about her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Medical workers came quickly with a bed on wheels. They took her mother away for care, leaving the daughter to wait and worry.\n\nLater, she learned her mother had fallen while trying to reach a flower vase on the highest shelf.",
            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The Mediterranean diet includes lots of plant foods, fish, and healthy fats from plants. It has fewer animal products and unhealthy fats. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood tests in overweight people.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. These women were nurses working in eleven different states. None had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Every few years, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Most women stayed in the study for all twenty years.\n\nThe researchers carefully checked hospital records and death reports to confirm heart problems and strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and weight.\n\nTo get better results, they averaged each woman's eating habits over time. They also considered other things that might affect the results, such as age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 30 percent fewer heart problems than those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, Burma has been controlled by military leaders who took power by force. In 2007, many people went into the streets to protest against the government. Buddhist religious leaders wearing orange clothes led these protests. This became known as the \"Saffron Movement\" because of the color of their clothes.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. But then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news reporters from other countries from taking pictures or writing stories. They killed one news photographer from Japan just because he was watching the protests. The government said only thirteen people died. But one military leader who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nThis kind of violent control has happened many times in history. Leaders often try to stop people who disagree with them. In ancient Rome, rulers said the gods chose them to lead. In Japan, people once believed their rulers were gods.\n\nOne famous example happened in China in 1989. Many students and workers gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest against their government. The Chinese government says about 200 to 300 people died, but the Chinese Red Cross says between 2,000 and 3,000 people were killed. Another terrible event was in Rwanda in the 1990s, where one group of people tried to kill another group. And of course, there was Hitler's time in power, when many Jewish people were killed.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and was very good at writing music that showed how well each player could perform. While he played piano, his most important work was as a writer of music. He knew how to create pieces that let musicians play freely while also writing parts that needed to be played exactly as written. He understood how each player sounded and how to make them sound good together.\n\nOne of his famous pieces is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this piece, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The piece has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: A trumpet plays the main tune\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays while the piano adds soft notes\nPart 4: The whole band plays together\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others keep time\nPart 6: The voice and winds play together again, with the voice making special sounds\n\nThe piece ends with the voice running up and down and one final note from a trombone.\n\nEllington wrote other pieces that used voices in new ways. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he had a trumpet player and a singer make sounds that worked together well. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used a special way of playing the trombone to start the song. These pieces show how Ellington was very good at mixing different sounds to make interesting music.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using numbers and math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these shells grow and change from parent to child, and over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure their shapes. We put these numbers into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how the animals grow to better understand how they change over long periods.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in circles. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. The whorls can grow at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front (where you can see the aperture), and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes a series of openings that follow a path. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw this path and write it as math numbers. Once we have these numbers, we can change them to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed about the same for the past ten years. The country has made progress in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it has not made enough progress in keeping mothers and children healthy.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. But many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are seeing doctors for stomach problems. Not enough mothers get care after giving birth.\n\nSpecial operations to help mothers give birth safely happen less often than they should. Only 4 out of 100 births use this method. In cities, 7 out of 100 births use this method, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 do. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. Poor people often cannot pay for care they need.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs can show quick results and are easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When lots of money goes to one health problem, other health needs get less attention. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms, and programs often do not work well together.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different kinds. Today, there are so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each kind of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting kinds of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, people found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal, and then made even more kinds from those. This continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other kinds of music. To understand Heavy Metal today, we need to understand how it grew into more than just one kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more show on stage. The people who play Heavy Metal must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed dark feelings that most other music did not show. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first Heavy Metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and showed the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album.",
            "Many years before artists began making strange dream-like pictures, Henri Rousseau was already painting his own dreams. His famous work \"The Dream\" from 1910 shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted most - to be accepted and praised by other artists. He faced a hard choice in trying to reach this goal.\n\n\"The Dream\" shows the battle inside Rousseau: should he paint like others to be accepted, or should he follow his own special way of making art?\n\nTo understand this better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in Laval, France. His father fixed metal things and sold hardware, and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Until he was forty, he worked for the city collecting money from people at road stations. His life was very sad at times - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. To feel better, he turned to painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This wish makes sense because he started painting when he was older and never had proper training. He was making art at the same time as many famous painters.\n\nRousseau did not get much attention for his work until Henri Matisse was becoming well-known. A writer named Jan Gordon said these two artists were very different: Matisse tried hard not to paint in common ways, while Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would help him fit in with other artists.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a basic reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or personal experience. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study these things, we try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than making rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we can never fully explain why they are good. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about its colors or its place in history. But these words do not fully tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have qualities that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that we tell stories because simple statements are not enough. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. I believe the same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI think right actions and art are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way that goes beyond words. This connection is especially strong in stories and books. Unlike music or painting, writing deals directly with human actions and choices. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life, just as our own lives teach us what is right and important.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in Munich to the northern city of Kiel on the sea. You can feel this same culture from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the middle of the country, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old land of the German people was called Germania. No one knows for sure how it got this name. A writer named Tacitus said the name came from a group called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved across the Rhine River to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars with the Gauls. He got this word from the Gauls to tell the difference between the people he had won battles against and those he had not. Some think the name means \"neighbor\" in the old Gaul language. Others say it comes from their fighting stick called a \"ger,\" or from old words that meant \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the Germans were the first people in their land. He thought they did not mix with other groups. He asked why anyone would leave warm lands to come to Germania with its cold weather and dark forests, unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania. They went there to get goods and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back to Rome. The German groups began to appear about two thousand years ago. They lived near the edge of the Roman Empire, where they traded goods. Many Germans also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows us that hiding who you are can help for a while, but people must eventually show their true selves. If they do not, they might lose their real identity. However, when people stop hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between staying true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people might not mind finding out they were fooled, but others will be angry about it.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises important questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the play, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and changing her clothes helps protect her.\n\nViola, who is new to this strange land, thinks she must act like a man to stay safe from bad people. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must hide her own loving feelings for Orsino, who tells her that no woman could love him as much as she does.\n\nToday's readers might see this story differently. The play shows how hiding one's true self can help bring hidden feelings into the open, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia likes Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or if she might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare seems to be making fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and then starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "The German control of its colonies was often very harsh. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Herero and Nama people. However, how Germany ruled its colonies was different in each place. The same was true for schools in these colonies.\n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other German colonies like Kamerun also had good schools. But South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different.\n\nIn East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left teaching African people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. The government did spend much money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write.\n\nMany things made South West Africa different. This study looks at these reasons, especially how the European settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany had colonies. These early writers mostly told about how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different German colonies. They showed how each colony was different. One important writer, Cohen, studied why schools in South West Africa and East Africa were so different. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa changed how schools worked there.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this better weather, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 European people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and land in the Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many differences that caused problems. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. This is common when two countries share a border. For example, Mexico and Cuba have had long-running problems with the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relationships.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the bad feelings between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religions and kings, just as they later did not like communism in the 1900s. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about land and people crossing the border to cause trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop bad people from attacking towns across the border.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped trying to take Mexican land and instead became more interested in doing business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I had never heard of. It left me unable to work or care for myself.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose nursing because I wanted to feel safe and secure, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or news writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of living on government help for sick people, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I do not feel safe or good about myself. Nothing is sure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can be sure what will happen. Even if you get ready, some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government. It is already weak and breaking. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, instead of each person trying to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what helped our early people live through hard times was not being alone. It was being kind, showing respect, and sharing what they had. The first people who crossed the big mountains in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready. I am ready. I have things for when bad times come: medical supplies, clean water items, and tape for windows. I have lights, power supplies, matches that work in rain, and food in cans. If you have land and can grow food, that is good. If you can save food for later, that is good too. Having a wood fire for heat is smart if you do not live in a big building with many homes.\n\nBut while you do all this, make friends with the people who live near you.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealth behind and found deep understanding. His ideas led to the start of Buddhism. Today, the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. We can see this in places like Sri Lanka, where people hold special ceremonies with water each year. Both religious teachers and common people join these events. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people.\n\nThese changes affect both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community, including both teachers and followers, has had to change some of its basic ideas over time. These changes came from forces both inside and outside the religion, some friendly and some not.\n\nTo understand these changes better, we need to know some important words. Forces from inside come from Buddhist people themselves. Forces from outside come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism, while others neither help nor hurt it on purpose.\n\nAt its heart, Buddhism has some basic teachings. Buddhists believe in three important things: Buddha, his teachings (called Dhamma), and the community of Buddhist teachers (called Sangha). The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books talk about Buddha's lessons, rules for living, and deep ideas about life.\n\nThe deep ideas include beliefs like: there is no lasting soul, life includes suffering, and nothing stays the same forever. Buddhists believe that understanding these ideas can help end the cycle of being born again and again. When someone fully understands these things, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that change the mind. Religious teachers must follow many more rules.\n\nThe most important teaching in Buddhism involves four main truths: life includes suffering, wanting things causes suffering, suffering can end, and there is a way to end suffering."
