            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

For example, we should not say \"all Russians act this way\" or \"all Japanese act that way.\" It is better to learn how people's ways of thinking affect talks between groups.\n\nWhen we meet people from other places, we often compare them to what we know. To understand others better, we can study their history and learn about what they believe. We should not try to change their ways, but accept them. This is very important when making agreements, especially if we are the weaker side. When we go to another place to talk, showing respect for their ways helps make agreements possible.\n\nDifferent groups have different ways of doing things, even in the same country. Companies often have their own special ways. Some want workers to stay late, while others let workers leave earlier. You can see how companies are different in how people dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to special groups. Even companies in America can be very different from each other.\n\nWhat people think is important tells us why they act certain ways. In some places, people think it is very important not to shame others or to keep peace in the group. In these places, someone talking for their company will not shame their leaders to win.

            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important Christian thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must focus on their specific understanding of God. While both men made good points, I think neither one fully explains why we should believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. Anselm believed that faith helps us understand God. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. In the Christian faith, believing without seeing proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He thought we could prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This way of proving God would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith first. They would only need to follow clear thinking. Aquinas gave five different reasons to prove God exists. He talked about how things change, how everything has a cause, why things exist, why some things are better than others, and why the world works in an orderly way. His ideas are like looking at a puzzle with one piece missing. Even without seeing the missing piece, you can know its shape and know it exists by looking at the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He puts words together in special ways to create feelings. He also uses colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He is very careful about how he uses white and gray colors to show readers something important.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald uses white and gray, he wants to show things that are all the same. White often means clean and rich, while gray shows things that are old or less bright. At the start of the book, he shows this by having many people wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Nick wears \"white\" clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom has on a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle. The only time people wear different colors is at Gatsby's big party.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to show regular, everyday things. The city buildings are \"white.\" Names of party guests become \"gray\" in Nick's memory. Regular people are often shown as white or gray too. The roads have \"gray cars,\" and there are \"gray\" areas where poor people live.\n\nLater in the story, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When he shows Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white car,\" it helps readers see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps show how Gatsby's dream about her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",

They also get honey from bees, and eggs and milk from farm animals.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. These \"organic\" farms often let people visit to learn about farming. People can also walk on the land to see birds and enjoy nature. Farmers can get money from the government to help keep the land good for wild animals while growing food.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land because no chemicals are used. But organic farming costs more money because workers must remove bad plants and insects by hand. Small farms also cannot save money the way big farms do. Other things that help wild animals, like planting special plants or moving animals to different fields, also cost more money. This is why farmers often need help to make money while helping nature.\n\nThe land in this story is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a national forest. The land has many different kinds of plants and animals. Some of these animals, like special rats and frogs, are in danger of dying out forever.\n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years.

He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like holding his breath, running, jumping, and climbing trees. He wanted someone to race with and sit with high in the pine tree behind their barn. But Doodle could not do these things. He was born with a weak heart, and doctors thought he would die. Even if he lived, he could never run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad. His dreams about having a normal brother were gone. He was so upset that he even thought about killing baby Doodle with a pillow. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his little brother.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. As humans made new tools through history, they found different ways to explain how the brain works. First, they said it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then your brain puts these simple pieces together to help you quickly know that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe brain decides which information is important to think about. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the small pieces but does not make you notice each one. However, you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room full of people talking.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only a few seconds, while others can last for many years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For example, when you learn a new word, you might remember what it looks like, how it sounds, or what it means. Scientists think short memories stay in the brain as electrical signals, while long memories are kept in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea says that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe money crisis. Many people lost their jobs, house prices fell sharply, and major companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: what caused this, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because of poor choices by government leaders. Banks were pushed to give home loans to people who could not pay them back. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bought these risky loans and sold them to others. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This problem spread through the whole economy.\n\nThe trouble started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted to win more public support. His government made it easier for people to get home loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes correctly predicted that this could lead to serious problems if the economy turned bad.\n\nSeveral things made the situation worse. Banks created new, complex ways to handle home loans. They mixed these loans together and sold them to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy.\n\nWhen house prices dropped, many banks and investment companies lost huge amounts of money. The five largest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices, one failed completely, and two others had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is better not to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small detail about our characters' lives.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in a simple way, without showing action. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person a lot of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the reader.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets someone she loves. They get married in a big wedding. Then her husband is killed while she watches. If this takes only two pages, and they only speak four times, something is wrong. The writer should show us more about the husband. We should see how he acts and talks, and how much he loves his wife. We should see how the wife's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about what happens. It also helps us understand the wife better: what she likes about him, how close they were, and what she hopes for in life.\n\nThe simple story \"They met, they married, he died\" needs more details to make it real.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these important details. Sometimes you want to move quickly past parts of the story. For example, you might have a new person in your story who used to fly planes, now works at night at a gas station, was married two times, has no children, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and ate eggs for breakfast. But you should not tell all of this at once.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only told us that he had hurt his wife many times with the knife and that police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was very badly hurt. Police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I think this story was too short, maybe because it happened in an area where many black people live. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not tell much about it. But when something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThey then told about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said someone shot it with a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money if someone can help find who did it.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what clothes he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he must stay in prison for 300 months, which is the same as 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a type of investment that follows a group of companies or products. It works like a regular stock that you can buy and sell during the trading day.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are buying a small part of many different companies at once. This helps reduce your risk because your money is spread across many businesses. You can buy just one share, or you can buy many shares. You can also sell ETF shares quickly if you need to.\n\nETFs usually cost less money to own than other types of investments like mutual funds. However, you do have to pay a small fee each time you buy or sell ETF shares, just like when you trade regular stocks.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to own the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in the ETF separately. These ten companies make up about 64% of the entire ETF.\n\nWhen we studied the numbers, we found something interesting. If you owned just these ten companies in the same amounts as they appear in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than owning the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much these investments changed in value over time. We did this by studying how much each stock's price moved up and down, and compared this to the ETF's movements.",
            "Looking at the numbers in Figure 17, we saw that fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This made us worry. We are not sure why this happened.\n\nWhen winter comes to our area, fewer people ride bikes or walk to school. This could explain some of the drop. December is also when the school term ends. Everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December is also holiday time, when students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people sent in records that month. But this does not explain why February's numbers were so low.\n\nAny project like this might start with great interest that later goes down. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Carpool Challenge Week.\" This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally become less involved, especially during school breaks.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of how we live. So, we needed to give people reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave out many prizes like gift cards for restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, and other places. We wonder if bigger prizes, like a new bike or electric car, would have made more people join. If we had started with small prizes and then offered bigger ones later, like bikes in December and a car in January, more people might have stayed interested in the project.",
            "I studied some early films at the Library of Congress. I looked at fifteen special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were called \"trick films\" because they used special ways of joining film pieces to create magic-like effects.\n\nMost of these early films followed simple rules. They were filmed inside on a stage, like a theater. The camera always stayed in one place, pointing straight at the stage. The films showed the whole stage or most of it, but never came close to the actors' faces. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nHowever, some films made in the early 1900s started to break these rules. They began using more than one scene in a single film.\n\nOne thing all these trick films shared was that they were filmed on an inside stage, like you would see in a theater. The camera never moved to follow the people or things in the film. This way of filming came from theater shows and magic acts. Because of this, the people in these films usually only moved from left to right on the stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from the right side and move back and forth across the stage.\n\nThe way these films were made meant that everything was shown from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close-up views of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once.\n\nMost early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple magic tricks, like people appearing and disappearing. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene, they were actually made by joining several pieces of film together carefully. You can see this in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) if you look very carefully at the moment when her head appears to be cut off.",
            "The old writing style called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas in interesting ways. Writers who used this style were both praised and criticized for their work. The first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old theater ideas with new ways of writing about people and nature.\n\nThe Gothic style borrowed many ideas from the Middle Ages, including building styles and old stories. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones. However, the Gothic style stayed popular because it mixed old theater ideas with new ways of showing how people think and feel.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic stories is the code of honor called \"chivalry.\" This comes from the Middle Ages, when knights were trained to be brave and good. Writers like Walpole thought their own time needed more of these good qualities. They wrote about the past to try to make their present time better.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his story, his country was having political problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic. Before we meet Frederic in the story, we learn he is a brave and suffering prince who people think died fighting enemies. This shows the old ideas of what a good knight should be, though Walpole makes these qualities bigger than life to make his point.",
            "Moving goods from start to end is called supply chain management. It begins when a customer orders something and includes getting raw materials, making the product, and sending it to the customer. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting supplies, keeping products ready, choosing where to work, moving things around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many to make. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best place to make things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter picking where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can cost much money and time later. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything - from what workers wear to how trucks bring things to the store.\n\nGetting supplies is the second main part. Leaders must choose what each workplace will do best and what work to give to other companies. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one thing. Leaders may ask other companies to help make things if it helps them work faster and save money while still making good products.",
            "Books from the Victorian time often described small details of life among rich people. However, two famous books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again later in his mind:\n\n\"He thought he was walking with Sikes and Crackit. He could hear their angry voices clearly. Then he heard guns fire and people shouting. Lights flashed before his eyes. Everything was loud and confusing. Someone he could not see pulled him away quickly. Through all these quick pictures in his mind, he felt pain that would not go away.\"\n\nThese dream-like moments show us what is happening inside Oliver's mind. When he remembers being shot, we see how little control he had over what happened to him. He feels lost and afraid. The pain stays with him, mixing with his fear. We can see that Oliver feels helpless, unable to fight against what is happening to him. It seems that Fagin, the bad man who controls him, has started to break Oliver's spirit. Otherwise, Oliver might have tried harder to save himself.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver: \"The day went by - what day? There was no day; it came and went too fast - and night came again. The night felt so long because it was so quiet, but the hours passed too quickly.\"",
            "I worked helping young students after school two years ago. I helped them with their studies, but I was best at teaching reading and writing in English. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in grade three or four. He had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others he could not say at all. Adrian was from a Latino family, but he spoke English very well.\n\nOne day, while watching some students who stayed behind from a school trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish and no English. Even with my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well.\n\nI share this story to talk about problems with language in our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when a child speaks English well, reading can be very hard. We all know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not so simple. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, putting students in English-only classes, having special teachers, or English learning classes. No single way will fix everything. We need to use all of these ways together!\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that students in two-language programs do better in school than other students. Some people think this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is wrong. If we teach this way in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard to do. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages in our schools.",
            "As children, we learn about powers greater than ourselves. Some learn at church, others at different places of worship, and some look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others refuse to believe in anything they cannot see or touch. People may change what they believe as they grow. No matter what path we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for light to guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to rain hit the metal roof while we smoked. Water poured from the roof edges, falling on the plants below. He looked into the distance, as if thinking of something far away. He had become very thin, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinner than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt scared and alone. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because speaking about it would make it too real. I moved closer and hugged him. Then I sat next to him, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after my birthday. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, they only kept him alive longer. I could not understand why. I wondered how a good power could let this happen. At night, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he left us. I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this job, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and how the government should work. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about government. He tried to protect farming because he thought it was the best kind of work, and this affected his views on power, law, and courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have basic rights that cannot be taken away. He said these rights work together - if you lose one right, you lose value in all of them. He thought the government should not be able to touch these rights. Some people said that without rules, strong and clever but bad people would win, but Taylor said this should not happen in a good society.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor said we need a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He had strong beliefs about right and wrong. He said that since people run the government, the good and bad in government comes from people. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from having too much power. He believed that even if the people running the government were thinking about themselves, good rules would make things fair. He knew people always think about themselves first, but said this only becomes bad when some groups live by taking from others. A good government was needed to control people's bad side, but it needed to be watched carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans at that time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too controlling. But he also thought just reading the words simply could be dangerous, and said we need to think about what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind trying to understand what I saw. I watched without feeling, like someone studying something far away. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind felt clear, as if I was only seeing, not thinking.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how the brain sees lines. One lesson teaches you to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood there looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I was too surprised by what I saw. Artists like Picasso had his blue pictures, and Monet loved to paint green gardens. If I were an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle, and my hand moved through the air. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand hit the handle again. The brown mass stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie tight around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the workers who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand in paper until it looked like a thick glove. Standing straight, then bending down, my hand went slowly into the bowl, like reaching into an oven for food.",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Having little experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with their friends, which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that there is a clear link between how old passengers are and how many crashes happen.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not let them drive with other young people in the car.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies human behavior thinks even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often want to do dangerous things just for fun. Because of this, it makes sense to wait to let people drive until they are less likely to take such risks.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, we will keep seeing deadly crashes. The problem will get worse in coming years as more young people become old enough to drive.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for a set time before getting a full license. Since this problem affects all states, making one law for the whole country would be a good way to protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nSecond, I will describe how doctors find out if someone has CAPD. There are certain signs that may show someone has this condition. For instance, a person might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or understanding when someone is joking by their tone of voice.\n\nThird, I will share ways teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms. This is important because many students with CAPD study in normal school settings.\n\nCAPD was first noticed by doctors in the 1950s. They saw it while studying children who had trouble communicating. Since then, doctors have created different tests to check for CAPD. These tests often ask people to listen to different sounds or words at the same time and then tell them apart.\n\nTo check if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how a person listens and responds to different sounds. They may also ask questions about how the person handles sounds in daily life. At this time, there is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD, and doctors do not know what causes it.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I can bring important things to this work: being helpful, showing respect, doing what is right, and always trying to learn more to do my job better. These things are important not just for the job, but to me as a person.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help others, but I was not sure how. In school, I saw many people run away from their problems or deal with them in wrong ways. This made me study the science of how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nOne summer day, I met a young boy at a friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my school training. They asked me to talk to the parents. The parents acted worried and said their son was just causing trouble. This made me want to become a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like this. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how the body works and what we get from our parents through our genes. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our place in society affect our sleep.\n\nWhen someone has trouble sleeping, doctors put it into different groups. The main groups are problems with getting to sleep, problems during sleep, and sleep troubles that come from other health issues. Problems with getting to sleep can mean staying awake when you want to sleep, or feeling too sleepy during the day. Some people even fall asleep suddenly without warning.\n\nThe body part that controls sleep is in the brain. Special brain cells help decide when we are awake or asleep. Scientists studied mice to learn how these cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nIf someone gets bad sleep receptors from their parents, they might always have trouble sleeping. This can make life hard. It can cause problems at school or work, especially when doing boring tasks that need attention. People might need medicine to help them sleep if their brain cells do not work right.\n\nStudies with mice help us understand how human sleep works. However, humans are more complex than mice, so we must be careful about what we learn from these studies.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for more than two years now. Moving around this large school area is hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building would take about 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make roads that are good for bike riders.\n\nA friend who started riding bikes again after many years told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped using a bike. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple breakfast can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was the best choice I made this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the shortest way there, can be hard to use sometimes.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time for it. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes than riding. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, walking would take too much of my time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people care more about the group than themselves. From birth, they are taught to want only quick happiness. The people are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders who tell them what to think.\n\nLooking at the book through the ideas of Marx, we can see what worried Huxley about how society was changing. He shows how everyone is made to be the same and how people are treated like things to be used.\n\nThe story shows how business controls people by keeping them from understanding their true place. People only care about getting things for themselves. In the book, different groups of workers called Delta and Gamma are taught while they sleep to always buy things and enjoy themselves. They cannot think for themselves. The top leaders control everything, but the workers do not know this.\n\nNo real friendships exist in this future world. Even the main people in the story are simple, without much personality. Huxley might be saying that technology and business together take away what makes us human. There is no love. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their time with different partners.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place without question. They obey completely, thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying things and following rules. They must stay the same as everyone else in their group.",
            "I studied Islam at my local college four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or war. This question is even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news groups changed their views about Islam. At first, they were very against it. Now, they are very accepting of it in America. Back in 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family members who were Muslim, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I used to think Muhammad made people follow Islam by force after he won battles. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him on their own to learn his teachings.\n\nI saw that the book tells stories about Muhammad that are very close to stories about Jesus. For example, it talks about how Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This is much like what Jesus did. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a quiet, holy man. But this makes less of Jesus's real miracles and life.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from history shows he was different. I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moved further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people still hold firmly to old ways of thinking, they may not be enough to stop new ideas.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christian history will turn around and go back toward its beginning. People will remove added teachings one by one, like going back in time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this change spreads across America and Europe, many people will want to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will be different. As people go back to earlier ways, the many different kinds of Christian groups will become more alike. Instead of having many different beliefs, Christians will share more common ideas.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome once killed Christians, but later became Christian itself. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. This coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for the first teachings of Jesus, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just as simple statements.\n\nLet us look at how Christianity began. It started with the Jewish religion. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many regular people who did not belong to any special group.",
            "After reading \"The Jungle,\" I see that people often think only about themselves and want more than they need. This is very clear in the story, especially when we look at the factory owners and leaders.\n\nThese business owners only want their companies to grow bigger and make more money. They do not care who gets hurt along the way. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes the factories with their tall smoke stacks sending dark smoke into the sky. This shows how the owners do not care about hurting the air or the land around them. They also do not worry about the dirty water and waste from the many animal areas.\n\nThe owners treat their workers very badly. They care more about money than people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can stop giving people work at any time, leaving families with no money to buy food. During this time, there were no laws to protect workers. No one helped these poor people who worked in the factories.\n\nSome groups said they would help the workers, but they often just took the workers' money. The workers could not leave these bad jobs because they had no other choices. They were like slaves, as Sinclair writes. Most were poor people from other countries who were always close to having no food. The factory owners treated them as badly as slave owners once did.\n\nThis book shows us that when people only think about getting more money and power, they often hurt others. The factory owners in \"The Jungle\" show this truth very clearly.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. Ancient Greeks thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile the word has old roots, Poe likely got it from more recent writing. He read many German writers, and one of them was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous story called \"Faust\" that came out in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries when he thinks of her. He gives everything he owns to his children, except the cup. He then walks to a high cliff, throws the cup into the sea, and dies. The sad king in this story is much like the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two different works. He used it in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" When you read \"Dream-Land,\" you can see how it matches with \"The King of Thule.\" Poe writes about a dark, lonely place where dead friends appear as spirits. The world he describes has no color. This is like the world of Goethe's sad king, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's work because Goethe was very famous. Many people were making new versions of his stories when Poe was writing. Also, Poe respected the poet Tennyson, who thought highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California. \n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled applesauce on the floor. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store had other problems with safety. In the same year, five other people had fallen in the store. Palmer wants the store to pay money for her injury. She also wants extra money as punishment because the manager knew about the danger but did nothing.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if someone hurts them on purpose or acts very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt others but did not care. \n\nPalmer has a good case for extra money because:\n- The manager knew about the spill\n- He was told twice about it\n- He did nothing to clean it up\n- Many people had fallen before\n- He knew spills could hurt people\n\nA judge will likely let Palmer try to get this extra money because the manager seemed to ignore the safety of his customers.",
            "She felt she needed something in her life. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had some ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live her life, still wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely had arguments with each other or with their daughter. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. While her parents were quiet people, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly hurt. Her mother kept saying \"ow\" and breathing hard. The daughter went to help her mother. \"Please... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells and worried people. But the daughter only thought about helping her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away for care. The daughter could only wait and worry.\n\nLater, she learned her mother had fallen while trying to reach a flower container from a high shelf.",
            "This research looked at how eating foods common to countries near the Mediterranean Sea might help prevent heart and blood vessel problems. The study focused on foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based proteins. This way of eating uses healthy oils instead of animal fats, and allows drinking small amounts of wine.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate these foods had better health and lived longer. They also found that this eating plan worked better than low-fat diets for losing weight and improving blood test results. However, these studies did not look closely at how this diet might prevent strokes.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. All were nurses working in eleven different states, and none had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Six times between 1984 and 2004, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full twenty years. \n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death certificates to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like weight, smoking, exercise, and medicine use.\n\nTo get the best picture of how women ate over time, researchers averaged their eating patterns across years. They were careful to consider other things that might affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean eating plan most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods had about 29% less risk of these health problems compared to those who ate the least of these foods.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that a cruel leader like Hitler now controls Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, soldiers have ruled Burma, which is also called Myanmar. In 2007, people there began to protest in the streets for the first time in many years. Many Buddhist holy men, wearing orange-colored clothes, led these protests. When more people joined the protests, the soldiers became angry. They attacked the Buddhist places of worship and hurt many people. They also arrested news reporters from other countries. One photographer from Japan was killed just for taking pictures of the protests. While the government said only thirteen people died, a soldier who left the army said thousands were killed.\n\nThis kind of cruel control has happened many times in history. Leaders have often tried to stop people who disagree with them. Some rulers even said they were gods to make people follow them.\n\nThere are other sad examples from recent times. In China in 1989, students and workers gathered in a large city square to protest against their government. Many were killed. In Africa, in the 1990s, one group of people in Rwanda tried to kill another group, and many died. In the 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible things show us that some leaders will do anything to keep power over their people.",
            "Duke Ellington was very important to jazz music because he led his band for many years. While he played piano, his greatest skill was writing music that showed how good each person in his band could play. He created music that let players make up their own parts while also writing exact parts for the whole band to play together. He knew how to make the band sound special in each song. Because he understood how each player sounded alone and with others, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever made.\n\nOne of his famous songs is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The song has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nPart 2: A quiet trumpet plays alone, changing the main tune.\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays alone, with soft piano in the back.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part.\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others play strong beats.\nPart 6: Like the first part again, but the voice makes rough sounds like an instrument.\nThe song ends with the voice running up and down notes, and the trombone makes an unusual ending sound.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington kept finding new ways to mix voices and instruments. He would have trumpet players and singers work together to make special sounds. He also wrote great parts for his long-time trombone player, Joe Nanton.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not describe living things using math. This is still mostly true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over many years. Our team studies a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to learn how these animals' shells change as they grow and how this affects their long-term change over many generations.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure important parts. We put these measurements into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us make pictures of possible shell shapes. By studying these shapes and doing tests, we can better understand how these animals changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. As the shell grows, the whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the hole facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts as small as one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that move through space. Scientists can follow this path by measuring the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw pictures and use math to show how shells grow. When we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might look.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough to reach its goals for making mothers and children healthier by 2015. There are many reasons for this, which show that the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births in Indonesia now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nOnly 4 out of 100 babies are born by operation, which is too low. In cities, 7 out of 100 babies are born this way, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is much better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms and papers to get supplies and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal music. This process continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand Heavy Metal music today, we need to know how it started and why it became more than just another kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more strong feelings, and more dramatic shows. Heavy Metal musicians are very skilled at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange and unusual music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed the darker side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it to show they could make strong, dark music like the Rolling Stones. They put this song on their White Album.",
            "Many years before artists began making strange dream-like pictures, Henri Rousseau was making his own special art. His famous painting from 1910, called \"The Dream,\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted - to be accepted and praised by other artists.\n\nRousseau was born in 1844 in a small French town called Laval. His father sold metal goods and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the French government collecting money from people at city gates until he was forty years old. His life was hard - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. He turned to painting to help him feel better and start a new life.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted pictures of poor people in a pretty way, Rousseau painted like someone who had learned on his own. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting when he was older and had no training. At the same time, there were many well-known artists working, like Matisse. While Matisse tried to paint in new and different ways, Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would make other artists accept him.\n\nRousseau kept working even though many people did not understand his art at first. He painted what he saw in his mind - strange forests, animals, and dream worlds. His work was different from other artists, and this made it special, even though it took many years for people to see this.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is good and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn many things in school and through life experiences. However, we seem to understand what is good and beautiful naturally, without being taught. When we study good behavior or beautiful art, we try to explain why they are special, rather than make rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or good behavior, we can never fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about colors or history. But these words alone cannot tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say \"There is just something about it\" before they give other reasons.\n\nI believe both art and good behavior have qualities that cannot be completely described in words. The writer Flannery O'Connor said that sometimes a story is needed because simple words are not enough. Even when we describe all parts of a book or painting, something special remains unexplained. The same is true for good behavior.\n\nI think art and good behavior are closely connected because we feel them deeply in our hearts, even when we cannot fully explain them. This is especially true with books and stories. Books are special because they show us how to live better lives. When we read, we think about what is right and wrong, just as we do in real life.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. Some say it came from an old group called the Tungrians. Others think it came from words meaning \"neighbor\" or \"spear.\" Julius Caesar wrote about Germania when he fought wars there about two thousand years ago. He wrote that the people there often fought with their neighbors.\n\nA man named Tacitus wrote about early Germans in the year 98. He believed they were the first people to live in that land. He wrote that the land was wild and cold, and wondered why anyone would want to move there unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans, who had a great empire to the south, did not want to live in Germania. They went there to trade and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back home. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and grew, and some joined the Roman army to earn money.",
            "The story \"Twelfth Night\" shows us how hiding who you are can help you trick others for a while, but in the end, you must return to being yourself. If you do not, you might lose your true self. However, when you stop pretending, people might turn away from you. You must then choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your friends. Some people might not mind finding out they were tricked, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they do it. In the story, Viola arrives in a new place and decides to dress as a man to stay safe. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women who could help her. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is a man and falls in love with her, mixing her up with her brother Sebastian. Also, Viola must hide her feelings for Orsino while pretending to be his male servant.\n\nToday's readers might see how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings to light, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer wanted to show. Instead, the story makes fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (dressed as Cesario) to Sebastian. At the end, she accepts Viola as family instead of a love interest, calling her \"sister.\" This shows that the pretending helped everyone find their true feelings, even though it caused problems along the way.",
            "The German control of other lands was often very cruel. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Ovaherero and Nama people. However, we cannot say all German-controlled areas were the same. Different places were run in different ways.\n\nLearning was also different across these areas. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. In places like Kamerun, other writers also said good things about German teaching efforts.\n\nBut South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different. In East Africa, the government made schools and helped teach local people. In South West Africa, they left teaching of local people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. However, the government spent much money to teach European people there. They made government schools and gave more help to church schools for Europeans.\n\nThese choices about schools had long-lasting effects. While other German-controlled areas had many African people who could read and write, in South West Africa most local people remained unable to read. Many things led to this different result in South West Africa. This study looks at these reasons, especially new findings about what settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German-controlled lands. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany controlled these areas. These first works mostly just told how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different areas. They showed how different the schools were in each place. Cohen wrote the most important work about this topic, looking at schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the large number of European settlers in South West Africa helped explain why schools there were different.\n\nSouth West Africa had weather that Europeans could live in better than other German-controlled areas, even though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived there. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 white people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest fight between them was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States beat Mexico and took Texas and other land in the southwest. The two countries had many other smaller fights until just before World War One. These problems started because Americans and Mexicans were different in their beliefs, ways of life, and what they wanted.\n\nThis kind of problem is common between countries that share land borders. The United States and Mexico are like many other neighbors who do not get along. Writer David M. Pletcher says that among countries in the Americas, only Mexico and Cuba had long-lasting problems with the United States. Both these countries are close to the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relations.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the problems. Writer Sally Frahm says that in the 1700s and 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religion and kings, just as they later did not like communism. Like the later fight with the Soviet Union, the problem with Mexico was partly about different beliefs and partly about what each country wanted. The Americans and Mexicans got these bad feelings from England and Spain, who ruled them before they became free countries.\n\nWriters Diehl and Goerts found 17 fights between Mexico and the United States during these 57 years. Most of these fights were about bad people crossing the border and causing trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop these problems.\n\nWriter Schmitt says the fighting began to stop when Mexico started to need the United States for help. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped wanting Mexican land and instead wanted to do business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I had never heard of before. This sickness left me unable to work.\n\nI was a nurse then. I picked this job because I wanted to feel safe and secure, which I did not feel as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone and had very little money. I could not work anymore. Today, after fifteen years of getting help from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry a lot. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived through these years without help from my family and friends. When big problems come, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have problems, big and small. We cannot plan for everything, and some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI think the United States should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to face everything alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong and independent. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing what they had. The people who moved west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nIt is good to be ready for problems. I keep emergency supplies like first aid items, water tablets, and food. I have lights, matches, and other useful things. If you can grow food or heat your home with wood, that is good too.\n\nBut most important: get to know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada. The religion has changed much since Buddha's time. For example, in the country of Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people take part in a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and regular people join this ceremony, even though Buddha never spoke about such events. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its beliefs over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside force,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhist people themselves. \"Outside force\" means changes that come from non-Buddhist people. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither try to help nor hurt Buddhism - we call these \"neutral.\" These forces might still affect Buddhism in some way.\n\nIt is important to understand the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three special things: Buddha, his teachings, and the community of Buddhist teachers. The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books tell people how to live, explain rules to follow, and share deep ideas about life. The deep ideas say there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Understanding these ideas helps people break free from being born again and again. When people gain this understanding, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe books also give rules for living. Regular people must follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that harm the mind. Buddhist teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is about four main truths: first, that life includes suffering; second, that wanting things causes suffering; and third, that we can stop suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",

Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "How people think and act in different places affects the way they make agreements. We should not make simple statements about whole groups of people. For example, we should not say \"all Russians act this way\" or \"all Japanese act that way.\" It is better to learn how people's ways of thinking affect talks between groups.\n\nWhen we meet people from other places, we often compare them to what we know. To understand others better, we can study their history and learn about what they believe. We should not try to change their ways, but accept them. This is very important when making agreements, especially if we are the weaker side. When we go to another place to talk, showing respect for their ways helps make agreements possible.\n\nDifferent groups have different ways of doing things, even in the same country. Companies often have their own special ways. Some want workers to stay late, while others let workers leave earlier. You can see how companies are different in how people dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to special groups. Even companies in America can be very different from each other.\n\nWhat people think is important tells us why they act certain ways. In some places, people think it is very important not to shame others or to keep peace in the group. In these places, someone talking for their company will not shame their leaders to win. In other places, people think it is good to push hard for what they want. Before starting talks, it is good to know these things. But it is also helpful to learn about the person you will talk with.",
            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important Christian thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must focus on their specific understanding of God. While both men made good points, I think neither one fully explains why we should believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. Anselm believed that faith helps us understand God. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. In the Christian faith, believing without seeing proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He thought we could prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This way of proving God would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith first. They would only need to follow clear thinking. Aquinas gave five different reasons to prove God exists. He talked about how things change, how everything has a cause, why things exist, why some things are better than others, and why the world works in an orderly way. His ideas are like looking at a puzzle with one piece missing. Even without seeing the missing piece, you can know its shape and know it exists by looking at the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He puts words together in special ways to create feelings. He also uses colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He is very careful about how he uses white and gray colors to show readers something important.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald uses white and gray, he wants to show things that are all the same. White often means clean and rich, while gray shows things that are old or less bright. At the start of the book, he shows this by having many people wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Nick wears \"white\" clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom has on a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle. The only time people wear different colors is at Gatsby's big party.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to show regular, everyday things. The city buildings are \"white.\" Names of party guests become \"gray\" in Nick's memory. Regular people are often shown as white or gray too. The roads have \"gray cars,\" and there are \"gray\" areas where poor people live.\n\nLater in the story, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When he shows Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white car,\" it helps readers see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps show how Gatsby's dream about her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",
            "San Diego County grows many foods because of its warm, sunny weather. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and many other foods. They also get honey from bees, and eggs and milk from farm animals.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. These \"organic\" farms often let people visit to learn about farming. People can also walk on the land to see birds and enjoy nature. Farmers can get money from the government to help keep the land good for wild animals while growing food.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land because no chemicals are used. But organic farming costs more money because workers must remove bad plants and insects by hand. Small farms also cannot save money the way big farms do. Other things that help wild animals, like planting special plants or moving animals to different fields, also cost more money. This is why farmers often need help to make money while helping nature.\n\nThe land in this story is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a national forest. The land has many different kinds of plants and animals. Some of these animals, like special rats and frogs, are in danger of dying out forever.\n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood. Someone got this land from the government long ago and probably used it for cows or wood since then.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked up ways the government could help a farmer. I also found another organic farm nearby to see how they run their farm.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection includes feelings like love, pride, and anger. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, they see themselves. In hard times, this connection becomes very clear, whether it brings good or bad results. These feelings can lead to difficult situations. Brothers must deal with what happens because of their feelings. When they look at each other, they see who they really are, not how others see them. Their true nature shows in what they do and what happens after.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show us these ideas. They travel through a beautiful area on a journey that cannot succeed. One brother feels very proud while the other feels very sad. At the end, only one brother lives. We see these ideas through the main character and his young brother Doodle, how they act together, and how the older brother tells the story. The older brother's feelings and how he sees the world affect everything he does.\n\nThe older brother's actions come from his pride. From the first time he takes Doodle outside until their last walk together, he feels unhappy with his brother. He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like holding his breath, running, jumping, and climbing trees. He wanted someone to race with and sit with high in the pine tree behind their barn. But Doodle could not do these things. He was born with a weak heart, and doctors thought he would die. Even if he lived, he could never run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad. His dreams about having a normal brother were gone. He was so upset that he even thought about killing baby Doodle with a pillow. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his little brother.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. As humans made new tools through history, they found different ways to explain how the brain works. First, they said it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then your brain puts these simple pieces together to help you quickly know that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe brain decides which information is important to think about. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the small pieces but does not make you notice each one. However, you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room full of people talking.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only a few seconds, while others can last for many years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For example, when you learn a new word, you might remember what it looks like, how it sounds, or what it means. Scientists think short memories stay in the brain as electrical signals, while long memories are kept in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea says that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe money crisis. Many people lost their jobs, house prices fell sharply, and major companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: what caused this, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because of poor choices by government leaders. Banks were pushed to give home loans to people who could not pay them back. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bought these risky loans and sold them to others. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This problem spread through the whole economy.\n\nThe trouble started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted to win more public support. His government made it easier for people to get home loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes correctly predicted that this could lead to serious problems if the economy turned bad.\n\nSeveral things made the situation worse. Banks created new, complex ways to handle home loans. They mixed these loans together and sold them to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy.\n\nWhen house prices dropped, many banks and investment companies lost huge amounts of money. The five largest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices, one failed completely, and two others had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is better not to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small detail about our characters' lives.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in a simple way, without showing action. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person a lot of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the reader.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets someone she loves. They get married in a big wedding. Then her husband is killed while she watches. If this takes only two pages, and they only speak four times, something is wrong. The writer should show us more about the husband. We should see how he acts and talks, and how much he loves his wife. We should see how the wife's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about what happens. It also helps us understand the wife better: what she likes about him, how close they were, and what she hopes for in life.\n\nThe simple story \"They met, they married, he died\" needs more details to make it real.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these important details. Sometimes you want to move quickly past parts of the story. For example, you might have a new person in your story who used to fly planes, now works at night at a gas station, was married two times, has no children, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and ate eggs for breakfast. But you should not tell all of this at once.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only told us that he had hurt his wife many times with the knife and that police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was very badly hurt. Police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I think this story was too short, maybe because it happened in an area where many black people live. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not tell much about it. But when something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThey then told about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said someone shot it with a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money if someone can help find who did it.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what clothes he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he must stay in prison for 300 months, which is the same as 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a type of investment that follows a group of companies or products. It works like a regular stock that you can buy and sell during the trading day.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are buying a small part of many different companies at once. This helps reduce your risk because your money is spread across many businesses. You can buy just one share, or you can buy many shares. You can also sell ETF shares quickly if you need to.\n\nETFs usually cost less money to own than other types of investments like mutual funds. However, you do have to pay a small fee each time you buy or sell ETF shares, just like when you trade regular stocks.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to own the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in the ETF separately. These ten companies make up about 64% of the entire ETF.\n\nWhen we studied the numbers, we found something interesting. If you owned just these ten companies in the same amounts as they appear in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than owning the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much these investments changed in value over time. We did this by studying how much each stock's price moved up and down, and compared this to the ETF's movements.",
            "Looking at the numbers in Figure 17, we saw that fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This made us worry. We are not sure why this happened.\n\nWhen winter comes to our area, fewer people ride bikes or walk to school. This could explain some of the drop. December is also when the school term ends. Everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December is also holiday time, when students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people sent in records that month. But this does not explain why February's numbers were so low.\n\nAny project like this might start with great interest that later goes down. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Carpool Challenge Week.\" This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally become less involved, especially during school breaks.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of how we live. So, we needed to give people reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave out many prizes like gift cards for restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, and other places. We wonder if bigger prizes, like a new bike or electric car, would have made more people join. If we had started with small prizes and then offered bigger ones later, like bikes in December and a car in January, more people might have stayed interested in the project.",
            "I studied some early films at the Library of Congress. I looked at fifteen special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were called \"trick films\" because they used special ways of joining film pieces to create magic-like effects.\n\nMost of these early films followed simple rules. They were filmed inside on a stage, like a theater. The camera always stayed in one place, pointing straight at the stage. The films showed the whole stage or most of it, but never came close to the actors' faces. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nHowever, some films made in the early 1900s started to break these rules. They began using more than one scene in a single film.\n\nOne thing all these trick films shared was that they were filmed on an inside stage, like you would see in a theater. The camera never moved to follow the people or things in the film. This way of filming came from theater shows and magic acts. Because of this, the people in these films usually only moved from left to right on the stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from the right side and move back and forth across the stage.\n\nThe way these films were made meant that everything was shown from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close-up views of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once.\n\nMost early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple magic tricks, like people appearing and disappearing. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene, they were actually made by joining several pieces of film together carefully. You can see this in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) if you look very carefully at the moment when her head appears to be cut off.",
            "The old writing style called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas in interesting ways. Writers who used this style were both praised and criticized for their work. The first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old theater ideas with new ways of writing about people and nature.\n\nThe Gothic style borrowed many ideas from the Middle Ages, including building styles and old stories. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones. However, the Gothic style stayed popular because it mixed old theater ideas with new ways of showing how people think and feel.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic stories is the code of honor called \"chivalry.\" This comes from the Middle Ages, when knights were trained to be brave and good. Writers like Walpole thought their own time needed more of these good qualities. They wrote about the past to try to make their present time better.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his story, his country was having political problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic. Before we meet Frederic in the story, we learn he is a brave and suffering prince who people think died fighting enemies. This shows the old ideas of what a good knight should be, though Walpole makes these qualities bigger than life to make his point.",
            "Moving goods from start to end is called supply chain management. It begins when a customer orders something and includes getting raw materials, making the product, and sending it to the customer. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting supplies, keeping products ready, choosing where to work, moving things around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many to make. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best place to make things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter picking where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can cost much money and time later. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything - from what workers wear to how trucks bring things to the store.\n\nGetting supplies is the second main part. Leaders must choose what each workplace will do best and what work to give to other companies. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one thing. Leaders may ask other companies to help make things if it helps them work faster and save money while still making good products.",
            "Books from the Victorian time often described small details of life among rich people. However, two famous books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again later in his mind:\n\n\"He thought he was walking with Sikes and Crackit. He could hear their angry voices clearly. Then he heard guns fire and people shouting. Lights flashed before his eyes. Everything was loud and confusing. Someone he could not see pulled him away quickly. Through all these quick pictures in his mind, he felt pain that would not go away.\"\n\nThese dream-like moments show us what is happening inside Oliver's mind. When he remembers being shot, we see how little control he had over what happened to him. He feels lost and afraid. The pain stays with him, mixing with his fear. We can see that Oliver feels helpless, unable to fight against what is happening to him. It seems that Fagin, the bad man who controls him, has started to break Oliver's spirit. Otherwise, Oliver might have tried harder to save himself.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver: \"The day went by - what day? There was no day; it came and went too fast - and night came again. The night felt so long because it was so quiet, but the hours passed too quickly.\"",
            "I worked helping young students after school two years ago. I helped them with their studies, but I was best at teaching reading and writing in English. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in grade three or four. He had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others he could not say at all. Adrian was from a Latino family, but he spoke English very well.\n\nOne day, while watching some students who stayed behind from a school trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish and no English. Even with my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well.\n\nI share this story to talk about problems with language in our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when a child speaks English well, reading can be very hard. We all know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not so simple. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, putting students in English-only classes, having special teachers, or English learning classes. No single way will fix everything. We need to use all of these ways together!\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that students in two-language programs do better in school than other students. Some people think this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is wrong. If we teach this way in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard to do. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages in our schools.",
            "As children, we learn about powers greater than ourselves. Some learn at church, others at different places of worship, and some look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others refuse to believe in anything they cannot see or touch. People may change what they believe as they grow. No matter what path we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for light to guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to rain hit the metal roof while we smoked. Water poured from the roof edges, falling on the plants below. He looked into the distance, as if thinking of something far away. He had become very thin, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinner than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt scared and alone. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because speaking about it would make it too real. I moved closer and hugged him. Then I sat next to him, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after my birthday. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, they only kept him alive longer. I could not understand why. I wondered how a good power could let this happen. At night, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he left us. I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this job, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and how the government should work. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about government. He tried to protect farming because he thought it was the best kind of work, and this affected his views on power, law, and courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have basic rights that cannot be taken away. He said these rights work together - if you lose one right, you lose value in all of them. He thought the government should not be able to touch these rights. Some people said that without rules, strong and clever but bad people would win, but Taylor said this should not happen in a good society.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor said we need a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He had strong beliefs about right and wrong. He said that since people run the government, the good and bad in government comes from people. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from having too much power. He believed that even if the people running the government were thinking about themselves, good rules would make things fair. He knew people always think about themselves first, but said this only becomes bad when some groups live by taking from others. A good government was needed to control people's bad side, but it needed to be watched carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans at that time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too controlling. But he also thought just reading the words simply could be dangerous, and said we need to think about what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind trying to understand what I saw. I watched without feeling, like someone studying something far away. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind felt clear, as if I was only seeing, not thinking.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how the brain sees lines. One lesson teaches you to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood there looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I was too surprised by what I saw. Artists like Picasso had his blue pictures, and Monet loved to paint green gardens. If I were an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle, and my hand moved through the air. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand hit the handle again. The brown mass stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie tight around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the workers who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand in paper until it looked like a thick glove. Standing straight, then bending down, my hand went slowly into the bowl, like reaching into an oven for food.",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Having little experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with their friends, which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that there is a clear link between how old passengers are and how many crashes happen.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not let them drive with other young people in the car.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies human behavior thinks even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often want to do dangerous things just for fun. Because of this, it makes sense to wait to let people drive until they are less likely to take such risks.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, we will keep seeing deadly crashes. The problem will get worse in coming years as more young people become old enough to drive.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for a set time before getting a full license. Since this problem affects all states, making one law for the whole country would be a good way to protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nSecond, I will describe how doctors find out if someone has CAPD. There are certain signs that may show someone has this condition. For instance, a person might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or understanding when someone is joking by their tone of voice.\n\nThird, I will share ways teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms. This is important because many students with CAPD study in normal school settings.\n\nCAPD was first noticed by doctors in the 1950s. They saw it while studying children who had trouble communicating. Since then, doctors have created different tests to check for CAPD. These tests often ask people to listen to different sounds or words at the same time and then tell them apart.\n\nTo check if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how a person listens and responds to different sounds. They may also ask questions about how the person handles sounds in daily life. At this time, there is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD, and doctors do not know what causes it.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I can bring important things to this work: being helpful, showing respect, doing what is right, and always trying to learn more to do my job better. These things are important not just for the job, but to me as a person.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help others, but I was not sure how. In school, I saw many people run away from their problems or deal with them in wrong ways. This made me study the science of how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nOne summer day, I met a young boy at a friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my school training. They asked me to talk to the parents. The parents acted worried and said their son was just causing trouble. This made me want to become a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like this. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how the body works and what we get from our parents through our genes. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our place in society affect our sleep.\n\nWhen someone has trouble sleeping, doctors put it into different groups. The main groups are problems with getting to sleep, problems during sleep, and sleep troubles that come from other health issues. Problems with getting to sleep can mean staying awake when you want to sleep, or feeling too sleepy during the day. Some people even fall asleep suddenly without warning.\n\nThe body part that controls sleep is in the brain. Special brain cells help decide when we are awake or asleep. Scientists studied mice to learn how these cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nIf someone gets bad sleep receptors from their parents, they might always have trouble sleeping. This can make life hard. It can cause problems at school or work, especially when doing boring tasks that need attention. People might need medicine to help them sleep if their brain cells do not work right.\n\nStudies with mice help us understand how human sleep works. However, humans are more complex than mice, so we must be careful about what we learn from these studies.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for more than two years now. Moving around this large school area is hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building would take about 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make roads that are good for bike riders.\n\nA friend who started riding bikes again after many years told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped using a bike. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple breakfast can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was the best choice I made this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the shortest way there, can be hard to use sometimes.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time for it. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes than riding. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, walking would take too much of my time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people care more about the group than themselves. From birth, they are taught to want only quick happiness. The people are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders who tell them what to think.\n\nLooking at the book through the ideas of Marx, we can see what worried Huxley about how society was changing. He shows how everyone is made to be the same and how people are treated like things to be used.\n\nThe story shows how business controls people by keeping them from understanding their true place. People only care about getting things for themselves. In the book, different groups of workers called Delta and Gamma are taught while they sleep to always buy things and enjoy themselves. They cannot think for themselves. The top leaders control everything, but the workers do not know this.\n\nNo real friendships exist in this future world. Even the main people in the story are simple, without much personality. Huxley might be saying that technology and business together take away what makes us human. There is no love. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their time with different partners.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place without question. They obey completely, thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying things and following rules. They must stay the same as everyone else in their group.",
            "I studied Islam at my local college four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or war. This question is even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news groups changed their views about Islam. At first, they were very against it. Now, they are very accepting of it in America. Back in 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family members who were Muslim, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I used to think Muhammad made people follow Islam by force after he won battles. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him on their own to learn his teachings.\n\nI saw that the book tells stories about Muhammad that are very close to stories about Jesus. For example, it talks about how Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This is much like what Jesus did. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a quiet, holy man. But this makes less of Jesus's real miracles and life.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from history shows he was different. I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moved further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people still hold firmly to old ways of thinking, they may not be enough to stop new ideas.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christian history will turn around and go back toward its beginning. People will remove added teachings one by one, like going back in time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this change spreads across America and Europe, many people will want to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will be different. As people go back to earlier ways, the many different kinds of Christian groups will become more alike. Instead of having many different beliefs, Christians will share more common ideas.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome once killed Christians, but later became Christian itself. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. This coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for the first teachings of Jesus, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just as simple statements.\n\nLet us look at how Christianity began. It started with the Jewish religion. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many regular people who did not belong to any special group.",
            "After reading \"The Jungle,\" I see that people often think only about themselves and want more than they need. This is very clear in the story, especially when we look at the factory owners and leaders.\n\nThese business owners only want their companies to grow bigger and make more money. They do not care who gets hurt along the way. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes the factories with their tall smoke stacks sending dark smoke into the sky. This shows how the owners do not care about hurting the air or the land around them. They also do not worry about the dirty water and waste from the many animal areas.\n\nThe owners treat their workers very badly. They care more about money than people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can stop giving people work at any time, leaving families with no money to buy food. During this time, there were no laws to protect workers. No one helped these poor people who worked in the factories.\n\nSome groups said they would help the workers, but they often just took the workers' money. The workers could not leave these bad jobs because they had no other choices. They were like slaves, as Sinclair writes. Most were poor people from other countries who were always close to having no food. The factory owners treated them as badly as slave owners once did.\n\nThis book shows us that when people only think about getting more money and power, they often hurt others. The factory owners in \"The Jungle\" show this truth very clearly.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. Ancient Greeks thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile the word has old roots, Poe likely got it from more recent writing. He read many German writers, and one of them was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous story called \"Faust\" that came out in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries when he thinks of her. He gives everything he owns to his children, except the cup. He then walks to a high cliff, throws the cup into the sea, and dies. The sad king in this story is much like the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two different works. He used it in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" When you read \"Dream-Land,\" you can see how it matches with \"The King of Thule.\" Poe writes about a dark, lonely place where dead friends appear as spirits. The world he describes has no color. This is like the world of Goethe's sad king, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's work because Goethe was very famous. Many people were making new versions of his stories when Poe was writing. Also, Poe respected the poet Tennyson, who thought highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California. \n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled applesauce on the floor. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store had other problems with safety. In the same year, five other people had fallen in the store. Palmer wants the store to pay money for her injury. She also wants extra money as punishment because the manager knew about the danger but did nothing.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if someone hurts them on purpose or acts very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt others but did not care. \n\nPalmer has a good case for extra money because:\n- The manager knew about the spill\n- He was told twice about it\n- He did nothing to clean it up\n- Many people had fallen before\n- He knew spills could hurt people\n\nA judge will likely let Palmer try to get this extra money because the manager seemed to ignore the safety of his customers.",
            "She felt she needed something in her life. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had some ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live her life, still wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely had arguments with each other or with their daughter. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. While her parents were quiet people, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly hurt. Her mother kept saying \"ow\" and breathing hard. The daughter went to help her mother. \"Please... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells and worried people. But the daughter only thought about helping her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away for care. The daughter could only wait and worry.\n\nLater, she learned her mother had fallen while trying to reach a flower container from a high shelf.",
            "This research looked at how eating foods common to countries near the Mediterranean Sea might help prevent heart and blood vessel problems. The study focused on foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based proteins. This way of eating uses healthy oils instead of animal fats, and allows drinking small amounts of wine.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate these foods had better health and lived longer. They also found that this eating plan worked better than low-fat diets for losing weight and improving blood test results. However, these studies did not look closely at how this diet might prevent strokes.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. All were nurses working in eleven different states, and none had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Six times between 1984 and 2004, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full twenty years. \n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death certificates to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like weight, smoking, exercise, and medicine use.\n\nTo get the best picture of how women ate over time, researchers averaged their eating patterns across years. They were careful to consider other things that might affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean eating plan most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods had about 29% less risk of these health problems compared to those who ate the least of these foods.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that a cruel leader like Hitler now controls Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, soldiers have ruled Burma, which is also called Myanmar. In 2007, people there began to protest in the streets for the first time in many years. Many Buddhist holy men, wearing orange-colored clothes, led these protests. When more people joined the protests, the soldiers became angry. They attacked the Buddhist places of worship and hurt many people. They also arrested news reporters from other countries. One photographer from Japan was killed just for taking pictures of the protests. While the government said only thirteen people died, a soldier who left the army said thousands were killed.\n\nThis kind of cruel control has happened many times in history. Leaders have often tried to stop people who disagree with them. Some rulers even said they were gods to make people follow them.\n\nThere are other sad examples from recent times. In China in 1989, students and workers gathered in a large city square to protest against their government. Many were killed. In Africa, in the 1990s, one group of people in Rwanda tried to kill another group, and many died. In the 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible things show us that some leaders will do anything to keep power over their people.",
            "Duke Ellington was very important to jazz music because he led his band for many years. While he played piano, his greatest skill was writing music that showed how good each person in his band could play. He created music that let players make up their own parts while also writing exact parts for the whole band to play together. He knew how to make the band sound special in each song. Because he understood how each player sounded alone and with others, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever made.\n\nOne of his famous songs is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The song has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nPart 2: A quiet trumpet plays alone, changing the main tune.\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays alone, with soft piano in the back.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part.\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others play strong beats.\nPart 6: Like the first part again, but the voice makes rough sounds like an instrument.\nThe song ends with the voice running up and down notes, and the trombone makes an unusual ending sound.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington kept finding new ways to mix voices and instruments. He would have trumpet players and singers work together to make special sounds. He also wrote great parts for his long-time trombone player, Joe Nanton.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not describe living things using math. This is still mostly true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over many years. Our team studies a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to learn how these animals' shells change as they grow and how this affects their long-term change over many generations.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure important parts. We put these measurements into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us make pictures of possible shell shapes. By studying these shapes and doing tests, we can better understand how these animals changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. As the shell grows, the whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the hole facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts as small as one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that move through space. Scientists can follow this path by measuring the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw pictures and use math to show how shells grow. When we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might look.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough to reach its goals for making mothers and children healthier by 2015. There are many reasons for this, which show that the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births in Indonesia now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nOnly 4 out of 100 babies are born by operation, which is too low. In cities, 7 out of 100 babies are born this way, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is much better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms and papers to get supplies and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal music. This process continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand Heavy Metal music today, we need to know how it started and why it became more than just another kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more strong feelings, and more dramatic shows. Heavy Metal musicians are very skilled at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange and unusual music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed the darker side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it to show they could make strong, dark music like the Rolling Stones. They put this song on their White Album.",
            "Many years before artists began making strange dream-like pictures, Henri Rousseau was making his own special art. His famous painting from 1910, called \"The Dream,\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted - to be accepted and praised by other artists.\n\nRousseau was born in 1844 in a small French town called Laval. His father sold metal goods and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the French government collecting money from people at city gates until he was forty years old. His life was hard - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. He turned to painting to help him feel better and start a new life.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted pictures of poor people in a pretty way, Rousseau painted like someone who had learned on his own. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting when he was older and had no training. At the same time, there were many well-known artists working, like Matisse. While Matisse tried to paint in new and different ways, Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would make other artists accept him.\n\nRousseau kept working even though many people did not understand his art at first. He painted what he saw in his mind - strange forests, animals, and dream worlds. His work was different from other artists, and this made it special, even though it took many years for people to see this.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is good and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn many things in school and through life experiences. However, we seem to understand what is good and beautiful naturally, without being taught. When we study good behavior or beautiful art, we try to explain why they are special, rather than make rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or good behavior, we can never fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about colors or history. But these words alone cannot tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say \"There is just something about it\" before they give other reasons.\n\nI believe both art and good behavior have qualities that cannot be completely described in words. The writer Flannery O'Connor said that sometimes a story is needed because simple words are not enough. Even when we describe all parts of a book or painting, something special remains unexplained. The same is true for good behavior.\n\nI think art and good behavior are closely connected because we feel them deeply in our hearts, even when we cannot fully explain them. This is especially true with books and stories. Books are special because they show us how to live better lives. When we read, we think about what is right and wrong, just as we do in real life.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. Some say it came from an old group called the Tungrians. Others think it came from words meaning \"neighbor\" or \"spear.\" Julius Caesar wrote about Germania when he fought wars there about two thousand years ago. He wrote that the people there often fought with their neighbors.\n\nA man named Tacitus wrote about early Germans in the year 98. He believed they were the first people to live in that land. He wrote that the land was wild and cold, and wondered why anyone would want to move there unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans, who had a great empire to the south, did not want to live in Germania. They went there to trade and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back home. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and grew, and some joined the Roman army to earn money.",
            "The story \"Twelfth Night\" shows us how hiding who you are can help you trick others for a while, but in the end, you must return to being yourself. If you do not, you might lose your true self. However, when you stop pretending, people might turn away from you. You must then choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your friends. Some people might not mind finding out they were tricked, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they do it. In the story, Viola arrives in a new place and decides to dress as a man to stay safe. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women who could help her. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is a man and falls in love with her, mixing her up with her brother Sebastian. Also, Viola must hide her feelings for Orsino while pretending to be his male servant.\n\nToday's readers might see how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings to light, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer wanted to show. Instead, the story makes fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (dressed as Cesario) to Sebastian. At the end, she accepts Viola as family instead of a love interest, calling her \"sister.\" This shows that the pretending helped everyone find their true feelings, even though it caused problems along the way.",
            "The German control of other lands was often very cruel. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Ovaherero and Nama people. However, we cannot say all German-controlled areas were the same. Different places were run in different ways.\n\nLearning was also different across these areas. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. In places like Kamerun, other writers also said good things about German teaching efforts.\n\nBut South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different. In East Africa, the government made schools and helped teach local people. In South West Africa, they left teaching of local people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. However, the government spent much money to teach European people there. They made government schools and gave more help to church schools for Europeans.\n\nThese choices about schools had long-lasting effects. While other German-controlled areas had many African people who could read and write, in South West Africa most local people remained unable to read. Many things led to this different result in South West Africa. This study looks at these reasons, especially new findings about what settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German-controlled lands. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany controlled these areas. These first works mostly just told how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different areas. They showed how different the schools were in each place. Cohen wrote the most important work about this topic, looking at schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the large number of European settlers in South West Africa helped explain why schools there were different.\n\nSouth West Africa had weather that Europeans could live in better than other German-controlled areas, even though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived there. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 white people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest fight between them was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States beat Mexico and took Texas and other land in the southwest. The two countries had many other smaller fights until just before World War One. These problems started because Americans and Mexicans were different in their beliefs, ways of life, and what they wanted.\n\nThis kind of problem is common between countries that share land borders. The United States and Mexico are like many other neighbors who do not get along. Writer David M. Pletcher says that among countries in the Americas, only Mexico and Cuba had long-lasting problems with the United States. Both these countries are close to the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relations.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the problems. Writer Sally Frahm says that in the 1700s and 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religion and kings, just as they later did not like communism. Like the later fight with the Soviet Union, the problem with Mexico was partly about different beliefs and partly about what each country wanted. The Americans and Mexicans got these bad feelings from England and Spain, who ruled them before they became free countries.\n\nWriters Diehl and Goerts found 17 fights between Mexico and the United States during these 57 years. Most of these fights were about bad people crossing the border and causing trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop these problems.\n\nWriter Schmitt says the fighting began to stop when Mexico started to need the United States for help. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped wanting Mexican land and instead wanted to do business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I had never heard of before. This sickness left me unable to work.\n\nI was a nurse then. I picked this job because I wanted to feel safe and secure, which I did not feel as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone and had very little money. I could not work anymore. Today, after fifteen years of getting help from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry a lot. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived through these years without help from my family and friends. When big problems come, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have problems, big and small. We cannot plan for everything, and some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI think the United States should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to face everything alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong and independent. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing what they had. The people who moved west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nIt is good to be ready for problems. I keep emergency supplies like first aid items, water tablets, and food. I have lights, matches, and other useful things. If you can grow food or heat your home with wood, that is good too.\n\nBut most important: get to know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada. The religion has changed much since Buddha's time. For example, in the country of Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people take part in a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and regular people join this ceremony, even though Buddha never spoke about such events. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its beliefs over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside force,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhist people themselves. \"Outside force\" means changes that come from non-Buddhist people. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither try to help nor hurt Buddhism - we call these \"neutral.\" These forces might still affect Buddhism in some way.\n\nIt is important to understand the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three special things: Buddha, his teachings, and the community of Buddhist teachers. The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books tell people how to live, explain rules to follow, and share deep ideas about life. The deep ideas say there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Understanding these ideas helps people break free from being born again and again. When people gain this understanding, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe books also give rules for living. Regular people must follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that harm the mind. Buddhist teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is about four main truths: first, that life includes suffering; second, that wanting things causes suffering; and third, that we can stop suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

To understand others better, we can study their history and learn about what they believe. We should not try to change their ways, but accept them. This is very important when making agreements, especially if we are the weaker side. When we go to another place to talk, showing respect for their ways helps make agreements possible.\n\nDifferent groups have different ways of doing things, even in the same country.

Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to special groups.

            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important Christian thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must focus on their specific understanding of God. While both men made good points, I think neither one fully explains why we should believe in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. Anselm believed that faith helps us understand God. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. In the Christian faith, believing without seeing proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He thought we could prove God exists through careful thinking and by looking at the world around us. This way of proving God would help spread Christianity because people would not need faith first. They would only need to follow clear thinking. Aquinas gave five different reasons to prove God exists. He talked about how things change, how everything has a cause, why things exist, why some things are better than others, and why the world works in an orderly way. His ideas are like looking at a puzzle with one piece missing. Even without seeing the missing piece, you can know its shape and know it exists by looking at the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this well in his book The Great Gatsby. He puts words together in special ways to create feelings. He also uses colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He is very careful about how he uses white and gray colors to show readers something important.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald uses white and gray, he wants to show things that are all the same. White often means clean and rich, while gray shows things that are old or less bright. At the start of the book, he shows this by having many people wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Nick wears \"white\" clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom has on a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle. The only time people wear different colors is at Gatsby's big party.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to show regular, everyday things. The city buildings are \"white.\" Names of party guests become \"gray\" in Nick's memory. Regular people are often shown as white or gray too. The roads have \"gray cars,\" and there are \"gray\" areas where poor people live.\n\nLater in the story, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show how some things are not special anymore. When he shows Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white car,\" it helps readers see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else. This helps show how Gatsby's dream about her might not be as wonderful as he thinks.",
            "San Diego County grows many foods because of its warm, sunny weather. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and many other foods. They also get honey from bees, and eggs and milk from farm animals.\n\nMany people in San Diego want to buy food grown without chemicals. These \"organic\" farms often let people visit to learn about farming. People can also walk on the land to see birds and enjoy nature. Farmers can get money from the government to help keep the land good for wild animals while growing food.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land because no chemicals are used. But organic farming costs more money because workers must remove bad plants and insects by hand. Small farms also cannot save money the way big farms do. Other things that help wild animals, like planting special plants or moving animals to different fields, also cost more money. This is why farmers often need help to make money while helping nature.\n\nThe land in this story is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a national forest. The land has many different kinds of plants and animals. Some of these animals, like special rats and frogs, are in danger of dying out forever.\n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood. Someone got this land from the government long ago and probably used it for cows or wood since then.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked up ways the government could help a farmer. I also found another organic farm nearby to see how they run their farm.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection includes feelings like love, pride, and anger. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, they see themselves. In hard times, this connection becomes very clear, whether it brings good or bad results. These feelings can lead to difficult situations. Brothers must deal with what happens because of their feelings. When they look at each other, they see who they really are, not how others see them. Their true nature shows in what they do and what happens after.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show us these ideas. They travel through a beautiful area on a journey that cannot succeed. One brother feels very proud while the other feels very sad. At the end, only one brother lives. We see these ideas through the main character and his young brother Doodle, how they act together, and how the older brother tells the story. The older brother's feelings and how he sees the world affect everything he does.\n\nThe older brother's actions come from his pride. From the first time he takes Doodle outside until their last walk together, he feels unhappy with his brother. He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like holding his breath, running, jumping, and climbing trees. He wanted someone to race with and sit with high in the pine tree behind their barn. But Doodle could not do these things. He was born with a weak heart, and doctors thought he would die. Even if he lived, he could never run or play hard games. This made the older brother very sad. His dreams about having a normal brother were gone. He was so upset that he even thought about killing baby Doodle with a pillow. But when Doodle smiled at him, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his little brother.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. As humans made new tools through history, they found different ways to explain how the brain works. First, they said it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses - touch, heat, sound, and light. These feelings become signals that the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then your brain puts these simple pieces together to help you quickly know that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe brain decides which information is important to think about. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the small pieces but does not make you notice each one. However, you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room full of people talking.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only a few seconds, while others can last for many years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For example, when you learn a new word, you might remember what it looks like, how it sounds, or what it means. Scientists think short memories stay in the brain as electrical signals, while long memories are kept in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea says that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe money crisis. Many people lost their jobs, house prices fell sharply, and major companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: what caused this, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because of poor choices by government leaders. Banks were pushed to give home loans to people who could not pay them back. Two big government-supported companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bought these risky loans and sold them to others. When people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. This problem spread through the whole economy.\n\nThe trouble started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted to win more public support. His government made it easier for people to get home loans. A New York Times writer, Steven Holmes, warned about this in 1999. He wrote that Fannie Mae was being pushed to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes correctly predicted that this could lead to serious problems if the economy turned bad.\n\nSeveral things made the situation worse. Banks created new, complex ways to handle home loans. They mixed these loans together and sold them to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy.\n\nWhen house prices dropped, many banks and investment companies lost huge amounts of money. The five largest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices, one failed completely, and two others had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and had to be taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is better not to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small detail about our characters' lives.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in a simple way, without showing action. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person a lot of information all at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the reader.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets someone she loves. They get married in a big wedding. Then her husband is killed while she watches. If this takes only two pages, and they only speak four times, something is wrong. The writer should show us more about the husband. We should see how he acts and talks, and how much he loves his wife. We should see how the wife's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about what happens. It also helps us understand the wife better: what she likes about him, how close they were, and what she hopes for in life.\n\nThe simple story \"They met, they married, he died\" needs more details to make it real.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these important details. Sometimes you want to move quickly past parts of the story. For example, you might have a new person in your story who used to fly planes, now works at night at a gas station, was married two times, has no children, likes to fish, wants to own the gas station, and ate eggs for breakfast. But you should not tell all of this at once.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still new. They only told us that he had hurt his wife many times with the knife and that police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was very badly hurt. Police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. I think this story was too short, maybe because it happened in an area where many black people live. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not tell much about it. But when something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThey then told about a hole made by a gun in a medical flying machine. They said someone shot it with a small gun. People who help solve crimes are offering money if someone can help find who did it.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time talking about how the person who did it was black. They told how tall he was and what clothes he was wearing.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he must stay in prison for 300 months, which is the same as 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a type of investment that follows a group of companies or products. It works like a regular stock that you can buy and sell during the trading day.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are buying a small part of many different companies at once. This helps reduce your risk because your money is spread across many businesses. You can buy just one share, or you can buy many shares. You can also sell ETF shares quickly if you need to.\n\nETFs usually cost less money to own than other types of investments like mutual funds. However, you do have to pay a small fee each time you buy or sell ETF shares, just like when you trade regular stocks.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to own the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in the ETF separately. These ten companies make up about 64% of the entire ETF.\n\nWhen we studied the numbers, we found something interesting. If you owned just these ten companies in the same amounts as they appear in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than owning the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much these investments changed in value over time. We did this by studying how much each stock's price moved up and down, and compared this to the ETF's movements.",
            "Looking at the numbers in Figure 17, we saw that fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This made us worry. We are not sure why this happened.\n\nWhen winter comes to our area, fewer people ride bikes or walk to school. This could explain some of the drop. December is also when the school term ends. Everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People might have forgotten to write down how they traveled. December is also holiday time, when students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. School starts again in late January, which might explain why few people sent in records that month. But this does not explain why February's numbers were so low.\n\nAny project like this might start with great interest that later goes down. To fight this drop, we made a special week in March called \"Carpool Challenge Week.\" This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our big problems was keeping people interested when they naturally become less involved, especially during school breaks.\n\nAnother problem is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of how we live. So, we needed to give people reasons to try other ways to travel. We gave out many prizes like gift cards for restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, and other places. We wonder if bigger prizes, like a new bike or electric car, would have made more people join. If we had started with small prizes and then offered bigger ones later, like bikes in December and a car in January, more people might have stayed interested in the project.",
            "I studied some early films at the Library of Congress. I looked at fifteen special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. These were called \"trick films\" because they used special ways of joining film pieces to create magic-like effects.\n\nMost of these early films followed simple rules. They were filmed inside on a stage, like a theater. The camera always stayed in one place, pointing straight at the stage. The films showed the whole stage or most of it, but never came close to the actors' faces. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nHowever, some films made in the early 1900s started to break these rules. They began using more than one scene in a single film.\n\nOne thing all these trick films shared was that they were filmed on an inside stage, like you would see in a theater. The camera never moved to follow the people or things in the film. This way of filming came from theater shows and magic acts. Because of this, the people in these films usually only moved from left to right on the stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from the right side and move back and forth across the stage.\n\nThe way these films were made meant that everything was shown from far away or middle distance. The camera never showed close-up views of faces or things. This was like watching a theater show, where you see everything happening on the whole stage at once.\n\nMost early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute long. They showed simple magic tricks, like people appearing and disappearing. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene, they were actually made by joining several pieces of film together carefully. You can see this in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) if you look very carefully at the moment when her head appears to be cut off.",
            "The old writing style called \"Gothic\" combines both old and new ideas in interesting ways. Writers who used this style were both praised and criticized for their work. The first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, mixed old theater ideas with new ways of writing about people and nature.\n\nThe Gothic style borrowed many ideas from the Middle Ages, including building styles and old stories. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought these old ways were not as good as new ones. However, the Gothic style stayed popular because it mixed old theater ideas with new ways of showing how people think and feel.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic stories is the code of honor called \"chivalry.\" This comes from the Middle Ages, when knights were trained to be brave and good. Writers like Walpole thought their own time needed more of these good qualities. They wrote about the past to try to make their present time better.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote his story, his country was having political problems. He may have thought people in his time were not as good or honest as people in the past. We can see this in his story through characters like Frederic. Before we meet Frederic in the story, we learn he is a brave and suffering prince who people think died fighting enemies. This shows the old ideas of what a good knight should be, though Walpole makes these qualities bigger than life to make his point.",
            "Moving goods from start to end is called supply chain management. It begins when a customer orders something and includes getting raw materials, making the product, and sending it to the customer. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts to moving goods: making things, getting supplies, keeping products ready, choosing where to work, moving things around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make and how many to make. They look at what people want to buy to make these choices. They also need to pick the best place to make things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter picking where to make things, leaders must plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can cost much money and time later. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything - from what workers wear to how trucks bring things to the store.\n\nGetting supplies is the second main part. Leaders must choose what each workplace will do best and what work to give to other companies. Sometimes, different places make different parts of one thing. Leaders may ask other companies to help make things if it helps them work faster and save money while still making good products.",
            "Books from the Victorian time often described small details of life among rich people. However, two famous books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the characters' feelings and actions.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we often see these strange events through dreams or dream-like moments. For example, when Oliver is shot, he experiences the event again later in his mind:\n\n\"He thought he was walking with Sikes and Crackit. He could hear their angry voices clearly. Then he heard guns fire and people shouting. Lights flashed before his eyes. Everything was loud and confusing. Someone he could not see pulled him away quickly. Through all these quick pictures in his mind, he felt pain that would not go away.\"\n\nThese dream-like moments show us what is happening inside Oliver's mind. When he remembers being shot, we see how little control he had over what happened to him. He feels lost and afraid. The pain stays with him, mixing with his fear. We can see that Oliver feels helpless, unable to fight against what is happening to him. It seems that Fagin, the bad man who controls him, has started to break Oliver's spirit. Otherwise, Oliver might have tried harder to save himself.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver: \"The day went by - what day? There was no day; it came and went too fast - and night came again. The night felt so long because it was so quiet, but the hours passed too quickly.\"",
            "I worked helping young students after school two years ago. I helped them with their studies, but I was best at teaching reading and writing in English. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in grade three or four. He had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others he could not say at all. Adrian was from a Latino family, but he spoke English very well.\n\nOne day, while watching some students who stayed behind from a school trip, I met Adrian's mother. She only spoke Spanish and no English. Even with my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well.\n\nI share this story to talk about problems with language in our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when a child speaks English well, reading can be very hard. We all know this is a problem, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not so simple. We have many ways to help: teaching in two languages, putting students in English-only classes, having special teachers, or English learning classes. No single way will fix everything. We need to use all of these ways together!\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just those who speak Spanish first. Studies show that students in two-language programs do better in school than other students. Some people think this wastes money and only helps a few students. This is wrong. If we teach this way in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard to do. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages in our schools.",
            "As children, we learn about powers greater than ourselves. Some learn at church, others at different places of worship, and some look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others refuse to believe in anything they cannot see or touch. People may change what they believe as they grow. No matter what path we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for light to guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to rain hit the metal roof while we smoked. Water poured from the roof edges, falling on the plants below. He looked into the distance, as if thinking of something far away. He had become very thin, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinner than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt scared and alone. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because speaking about it would make it too real. I moved closer and hugged him. Then I sat next to him, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nMy father died in December that year, just after my birthday. The medical treatments did not stop his pain, they only kept him alive longer. I could not understand why. I wondered how a good power could let this happen. At night, I stopped praying. I thought if there was a God, He no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he left us. I knew him better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He worked mainly as a farmer, and this job, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and how the government should work. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about government. He tried to protect farming because he thought it was the best kind of work, and this affected his views on power, law, and courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have basic rights that cannot be taken away. He said these rights work together - if you lose one right, you lose value in all of them. He thought the government should not be able to touch these rights. Some people said that without rules, strong and clever but bad people would win, but Taylor said this should not happen in a good society.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor said we need a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He had strong beliefs about right and wrong. He said that since people run the government, the good and bad in government comes from people. He thought good rules were ones that protected what people owned, helped farming grow, and stopped big business from having too much power. He believed that even if the people running the government were thinking about themselves, good rules would make things fair. He knew people always think about themselves first, but said this only becomes bad when some groups live by taking from others. A good government was needed to control people's bad side, but it needed to be watched carefully.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans at that time, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as it was written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too controlling. But he also thought just reading the words simply could be dangerous, and said we need to think about what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at the toilet, my mind trying to understand what I saw. I watched without feeling, like someone studying something far away. Thoughts came and went quickly. My mind felt clear, as if I was only seeing, not thinking.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since I was six, I wanted to learn to draw. The book teaches everything about drawing, from how to hold a pencil to how the brain sees lines. One lesson teaches you to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood there looking at the toilet, I could not imagine such a frame. I was too surprised by what I saw. Artists like Picasso had his blue pictures, and Monet loved to paint green gardens. If I were an artist, this would be my brown period.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle, and my hand moved through the air. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand hit the handle again. The brown mass stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there in my work clothes, green tie tight around my neck, holding a mop. I looked at what someone had left for the workers who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After trying to flush several more times, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand in paper until it looked like a thick glove. Standing straight, then bending down, my hand went slowly into the bowl, like reaching into an oven for food.",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things work together to make driving very dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. Health experts say one part of the problem is that young minds are not ready for the dangers of driving. Having little experience is another big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with their friends, which they often do. A study in Southern California showed that there is a clear link between how old passengers are and how many crashes happen.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make young drivers safer. They give special licenses that only let young people drive at certain times and do not let them drive with other young people in the car.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a short-term answer. The real problem is that the youngest drivers, as a group, cannot handle the dangers and duties of driving well enough. One expert who studies human behavior thinks even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often want to do dangerous things just for fun. Because of this, it makes sense to wait to let people drive until they are less likely to take such risks.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, we will keep seeing deadly crashes. The problem will get worse in coming years as more young people become old enough to drive.\n\nThe answer could be simple. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to learn and practice with an adult for a set time before getting a full license. Since this problem affects all states, making one law for the whole country would be a good way to protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of a brain condition that affects how people process sound. The condition is called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.\n\nFirst, I will explain what CAPD is. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally, but their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is noise in the room. Their ears work fine, but their brains have difficulty making sense of what they hear.\n\nSecond, I will describe how doctors find out if someone has CAPD. There are certain signs that may show someone has this condition. For instance, a person might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or understanding when someone is joking by their tone of voice.\n\nThird, I will share ways teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms. This is important because many students with CAPD study in normal school settings.\n\nCAPD was first noticed by doctors in the 1950s. They saw it while studying children who had trouble communicating. Since then, doctors have created different tests to check for CAPD. These tests often ask people to listen to different sounds or words at the same time and then tell them apart.\n\nTo check if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how a person listens and responds to different sounds. They may also ask questions about how the person handles sounds in daily life. At this time, there is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD, and doctors do not know what causes it.",
            "I want to work in social services to help children who have been hurt by their families. I also want to help families who are having problems. I can bring important things to this work: being helpful, showing respect, doing what is right, and always trying to learn more to do my job better. These things are important not just for the job, but to me as a person.\n\nI always knew I wanted to help others, but I was not sure how. In school, I saw many people run away from their problems or deal with them in wrong ways. This made me study the science of how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about what to do next.\n\nOne summer day, I met a young boy at a friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my school training. They asked me to talk to the parents. The parents acted worried and said their son was just causing trouble. This made me want to become a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is special, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like this. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how the body works and what we get from our parents through our genes. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our place in society affect our sleep.\n\nWhen someone has trouble sleeping, doctors put it into different groups. The main groups are problems with getting to sleep, problems during sleep, and sleep troubles that come from other health issues. Problems with getting to sleep can mean staying awake when you want to sleep, or feeling too sleepy during the day. Some people even fall asleep suddenly without warning.\n\nThe body part that controls sleep is in the brain. Special brain cells help decide when we are awake or asleep. Scientists studied mice to learn how these cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nIf someone gets bad sleep receptors from their parents, they might always have trouble sleeping. This can make life hard. It can cause problems at school or work, especially when doing boring tasks that need attention. People might need medicine to help them sleep if their brain cells do not work right.\n\nStudies with mice help us understand how human sleep works. However, humans are more complex than mice, so we must be careful about what we learn from these studies.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for more than two years now. Moving around this large school area is hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in East Halls, which is very far from the center of school. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to my classes in Willard building would take about 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that not long ago, East Halls stood alone, far from other buildings. Now that empty land has new sports fields and big buildings, including places for food and health care. As our school grows bigger, it gets harder to move from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make roads that are good for bike riders.\n\nA friend who started riding bikes again after many years told me something interesting. He said he did not know why he ever stopped using a bike. He thinks bikes are the best way to move around school. Riding a bike is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple breakfast can give you enough power to ride 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live away from school, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Buying a bike was the best choice I made this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road, the shortest way there, can be hard to use sometimes.\n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time for it. Without my bike, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to Thomas building every day would take 40 more minutes than riding. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about all my other classes and things I need to do, walking would take too much of my time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people care more about the group than themselves. From birth, they are taught to want only quick happiness. The people are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders who tell them what to think.\n\nLooking at the book through the ideas of Marx, we can see what worried Huxley about how society was changing. He shows how everyone is made to be the same and how people are treated like things to be used.\n\nThe story shows how business controls people by keeping them from understanding their true place. People only care about getting things for themselves. In the book, different groups of workers called Delta and Gamma are taught while they sleep to always buy things and enjoy themselves. They cannot think for themselves. The top leaders control everything, but the workers do not know this.\n\nNo real friendships exist in this future world. Even the main people in the story are simple, without much personality. Huxley might be saying that technology and business together take away what makes us human. There is no love. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their time with different partners.\n\nEach group of people accepts their place without question. They obey completely, thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying things and following rules. They must stay the same as everyone else in their group.",
            "I studied Islam at my local college four years ago. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that wanted peace or war. This question is even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news groups changed their views about Islam. At first, they were very against it. Now, they are very accepting of it in America. Back in 2001, no one would have thought we could have someone like Barack Obama, who has family members who were Muslim, run for president.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I knew before. I used to think Muhammad made people follow Islam by force after he won battles. But the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him on their own to learn his teachings.\n\nI saw that the book tells stories about Muhammad that are very close to stories about Jesus. For example, it talks about how Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This is much like what Jesus did. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a quiet, holy man. But this makes less of Jesus's real miracles and life.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslim on their own. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. But what we know from history shows he was different. I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of how Muhammad gained his power.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moved further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people still hold firmly to old ways of thinking, they may not be enough to stop new ideas.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christian history will turn around and go back toward its beginning. People will remove added teachings one by one, like going back in time. In the end, only Jesus' original message from God will remain.\n\nWhen this change spreads across America and Europe, many people will want to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will be different. As people go back to earlier ways, the many different kinds of Christian groups will become more alike. Instead of having many different beliefs, Christians will share more common ideas.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome once killed Christians, but later became Christian itself. America once had slaves, but now has African-American leaders. This coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for the first teachings of Jesus, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just as simple statements.\n\nLet us look at how Christianity began. It started with the Jewish religion. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many regular people who did not belong to any special group.",
            "After reading \"The Jungle,\" I see that people often think only about themselves and want more than they need. This is very clear in the story, especially when we look at the factory owners and leaders.\n\nThese business owners only want their companies to grow bigger and make more money. They do not care who gets hurt along the way. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes the factories with their tall smoke stacks sending dark smoke into the sky. This shows how the owners do not care about hurting the air or the land around them. They also do not worry about the dirty water and waste from the many animal areas.\n\nThe owners treat their workers very badly. They care more about money than people. Workers must work long hours in dangerous places. The owners can stop giving people work at any time, leaving families with no money to buy food. During this time, there were no laws to protect workers. No one helped these poor people who worked in the factories.\n\nSome groups said they would help the workers, but they often just took the workers' money. The workers could not leave these bad jobs because they had no other choices. They were like slaves, as Sinclair writes. Most were poor people from other countries who were always close to having no food. The factory owners treated them as badly as slave owners once did.\n\nThis book shows us that when people only think about getting more money and power, they often hurt others. The factory owners in \"The Jungle\" show this truth very clearly.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his best works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. Ancient Greeks thought this was the edge of the world they knew.\n\nWhile the word has old roots, Poe likely got it from more recent writing. He read many German writers, and one of them was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous story called \"Faust\" that came out in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries when he thinks of her. He gives everything he owns to his children, except the cup. He then walks to a high cliff, throws the cup into the sea, and dies. The sad king in this story is much like the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two different works. He used it in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" When you read \"Dream-Land,\" you can see how it matches with \"The King of Thule.\" Poe writes about a dark, lonely place where dead friends appear as spirits. The world he describes has no color. This is like the world of Goethe's sad king, who lost his wife and did not want to live anymore.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's work because Goethe was very famous. Many people were making new versions of his stories when Poe was writing. Also, Poe respected the poet Tennyson, who thought highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Let me explain a legal case about safety in a store in California. \n\nA woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back. She fell because there was spilled applesauce on the floor. Before she fell, two workers told the store manager about the spill. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. The spill stayed on the floor for thirty minutes before Palmer fell.\n\nThe store had other problems with safety. In the same year, five other people had fallen in the store. Palmer wants the store to pay money for her injury. She also wants extra money as punishment because the manager knew about the danger but did nothing.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if someone hurts them on purpose or acts very badly. The law says the bad actions must show the person knew they could hurt others but did not care. \n\nPalmer has a good case for extra money because:\n- The manager knew about the spill\n- He was told twice about it\n- He did nothing to clean it up\n- Many people had fallen before\n- He knew spills could hurt people\n\nA judge will likely let Palmer try to get this extra money because the manager seemed to ignore the safety of his customers.",
            "She felt she needed something in her life. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had some ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live her life, still wondering about these feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely had arguments with each other or with their daughter. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. While her parents were quiet people, she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not peaceful. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly hurt. Her mother kept saying \"ow\" and breathing hard. The daughter went to help her mother. \"Please... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me where to hold you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had strong smells and worried people. But the daughter only thought about helping her mother. She carried her mother inside and called for help. Doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away for care. The daughter could only wait and worry.\n\nLater, she learned her mother had fallen while trying to reach a flower container from a high shelf.",
            "This research looked at how eating foods common to countries near the Mediterranean Sea might help prevent heart and blood vessel problems. The study focused on foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based proteins. This way of eating uses healthy oils instead of animal fats, and allows drinking small amounts of wine.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate these foods had better health and lived longer. They also found that this eating plan worked better than low-fat diets for losing weight and improving blood test results. However, these studies did not look closely at how this diet might prevent strokes.\n\nThe study watched 74,886 women between ages 38 and 63 for twenty years. All were nurses working in eleven different states, and none had heart problems or diabetes when the study began. Six times between 1984 and 2004, the women filled out forms about what they ate. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full twenty years. \n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death certificates to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like weight, smoking, exercise, and medicine use.\n\nTo get the best picture of how women ate over time, researchers averaged their eating patterns across years. They were careful to consider other things that might affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean eating plan most closely had fewer heart problems and strokes. During the twenty years, 2,391 women had heart problems, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods had about 29% less risk of these health problems compared to those who ate the least of these foods.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that a cruel leader like Hitler now controls Burma, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince 1962, soldiers have ruled Burma, which is also called Myanmar. In 2007, people there began to protest in the streets for the first time in many years. Many Buddhist holy men, wearing orange-colored clothes, led these protests. When more people joined the protests, the soldiers became angry. They attacked the Buddhist places of worship and hurt many people. They also arrested news reporters from other countries. One photographer from Japan was killed just for taking pictures of the protests. While the government said only thirteen people died, a soldier who left the army said thousands were killed.\n\nThis kind of cruel control has happened many times in history. Leaders have often tried to stop people who disagree with them. Some rulers even said they were gods to make people follow them.\n\nThere are other sad examples from recent times. In China in 1989, students and workers gathered in a large city square to protest against their government. Many were killed. In Africa, in the 1990s, one group of people in Rwanda tried to kill another group, and many died. In the 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible things show us that some leaders will do anything to keep power over their people.",
            "Duke Ellington was very important to jazz music because he led his band for many years. While he played piano, his greatest skill was writing music that showed how good each person in his band could play. He created music that let players make up their own parts while also writing exact parts for the whole band to play together. He knew how to make the band sound special in each song. Because he understood how each player sounded alone and with others, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever made.\n\nOne of his famous songs is called \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used a singer's voice like another instrument in the band, without using words. This was something new at the time. The song has six main parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and wind instruments play back and forth. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nPart 2: A quiet trumpet plays alone, changing the main tune.\nPart 3: A high clarinet plays alone, with soft piano in the back.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part.\nPart 5: The wind instruments play high notes while others play strong beats.\nPart 6: Like the first part again, but the voice makes rough sounds like an instrument.\nThe song ends with the voice running up and down notes, and the trombone makes an unusual ending sound.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington kept finding new ways to mix voices and instruments. He would have trumpet players and singers work together to make special sounds. He also wrote great parts for his long-time trombone player, Joe Nanton.",
            "How do living things change over time? What limits the way they can change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not describe living things using math. This is still mostly true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea animal shells grow and change over many years. Our team studies a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to learn how these animals' shells change as they grow and how this affects their long-term change over many generations.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells to measure important parts. We put these measurements into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us make pictures of possible shell shapes. By studying these shapes and doing tests, we can better understand how these animals changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. These circles are called whorls. The whorls turn around a center line called the columella. As the shell grows, the whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the hole facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Count the whorls from this line. You can count parts as small as one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that move through space. Scientists can follow this path by measuring the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can draw pictures and use math to show how shells grow. When we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might look.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough to reach its goals for making mothers and children healthier by 2015. There are many reasons for this, which show that the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births in Indonesia now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional helpers who cannot deal with serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nOnly 4 out of 100 babies are born by operation, which is too low. In cities, 7 out of 100 babies are born this way, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is much better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nIndonesia must decide how to fix these problems. They could make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they could make the whole health system better. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money. Workers must fill out too many forms and papers to get supplies and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy Metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after Heavy Metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of Heavy Metal music. This process continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of Heavy Metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand Heavy Metal music today, we need to know how it started and why it became more than just another kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more strong feelings, and more dramatic shows. Heavy Metal musicians are very skilled at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange and unusual music. Heavy Metal was different from other popular music because it showed the darker side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it to show they could make strong, dark music like the Rolling Stones. They put this song on their White Album.",
            "Many years before artists began making strange dream-like pictures, Henri Rousseau was making his own special art. His famous painting from 1910, called \"The Dream,\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted - to be accepted and praised by other artists.\n\nRousseau was born in 1844 in a small French town called Laval. His father sold metal goods and had enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the French government collecting money from people at city gates until he was forty years old. His life was hard - his first wife died, and he lost eight babies, leaving him with just one daughter named Julia. He turned to painting to help him feel better and start a new life.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted pictures of poor people in a pretty way, Rousseau painted like someone who had learned on his own. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting when he was older and had no training. At the same time, there were many well-known artists working, like Matisse. While Matisse tried to paint in new and different ways, Rousseau just wanted to paint pictures that would make other artists accept him.\n\nRousseau kept working even though many people did not understand his art at first. He painted what he saw in his mind - strange forests, animals, and dream worlds. His work was different from other artists, and this made it special, even though it took many years for people to see this.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is good and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn many things in school and through life experiences. However, we seem to understand what is good and beautiful naturally, without being taught. When we study good behavior or beautiful art, we try to explain why they are special, rather than make rules about them.\n\nWhen we talk about art or good behavior, we can never fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss the famous painting Mona Lisa, they might talk about colors or history. But these words alone cannot tell us why it is great art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art, they first say \"There is just something about it\" before they give other reasons.\n\nI believe both art and good behavior have qualities that cannot be completely described in words. The writer Flannery O'Connor said that sometimes a story is needed because simple words are not enough. Even when we describe all parts of a book or painting, something special remains unexplained. The same is true for good behavior.\n\nI think art and good behavior are closely connected because we feel them deeply in our hearts, even when we cannot fully explain them. This is especially true with books and stories. Books are special because they show us how to live better lives. When we read, we think about what is right and wrong, just as we do in real life.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's culture comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. Some say it came from an old group called the Tungrians. Others think it came from words meaning \"neighbor\" or \"spear.\" Julius Caesar wrote about Germania when he fought wars there about two thousand years ago. He wrote that the people there often fought with their neighbors.\n\nA man named Tacitus wrote about early Germans in the year 98. He believed they were the first people to live in that land. He wrote that the land was wild and cold, and wondered why anyone would want to move there unless it was already their home.\n\nThe Romans, who had a great empire to the south, did not want to live in Germania. They went there to trade and sometimes to fight, but they usually went back home. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and grew, and some joined the Roman army to earn money.",
            "The story \"Twelfth Night\" shows us how hiding who you are can help you trick others for a while, but in the end, you must return to being yourself. If you do not, you might lose your true self. However, when you stop pretending, people might turn away from you. You must then choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your friends. Some people might not mind finding out they were tricked, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they do it. In the story, Viola arrives in a new place and decides to dress as a man to stay safe. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women who could help her. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is a man and falls in love with her, mixing her up with her brother Sebastian. Also, Viola must hide her feelings for Orsino while pretending to be his male servant.\n\nToday's readers might see how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings to light, especially for Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer wanted to show. Instead, the story makes fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (dressed as Cesario) to Sebastian. At the end, she accepts Viola as family instead of a love interest, calling her \"sister.\" This shows that the pretending helped everyone find their true feelings, even though it caused problems along the way.",
            "The German control of other lands was often very cruel. This was especially true in South West Africa, where they killed many local Ovaherero and Nama people. However, we cannot say all German-controlled areas were the same. Different places were run in different ways.\n\nLearning was also different across these areas. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. In places like Kamerun, other writers also said good things about German teaching efforts.\n\nBut South West Africa (now called Namibia) was very different. In East Africa, the government made schools and helped teach local people. In South West Africa, they left teaching of local people mostly to church groups, giving them little help. However, the government spent much money to teach European people there. They made government schools and gave more help to church schools for Europeans.\n\nThese choices about schools had long-lasting effects. While other German-controlled areas had many African people who could read and write, in South West Africa most local people remained unable to read. Many things led to this different result in South West Africa. This study looks at these reasons, especially new findings about what settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German-controlled lands. Most early writing was in German, from the time when Germany controlled these areas. These first works mostly just told how the schools worked. Later, English writers compared schools in different areas. They showed how different the schools were in each place. Cohen wrote the most important work about this topic, looking at schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the large number of European settlers in South West Africa helped explain why schools there were different.\n\nSouth West Africa had weather that Europeans could live in better than other German-controlled areas, even though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived there. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 white people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest fight between them was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States beat Mexico and took Texas and other land in the southwest. The two countries had many other smaller fights until just before World War One. These problems started because Americans and Mexicans were different in their beliefs, ways of life, and what they wanted.\n\nThis kind of problem is common between countries that share land borders. The United States and Mexico are like many other neighbors who do not get along. Writer David M. Pletcher says that among countries in the Americas, only Mexico and Cuba had long-lasting problems with the United States. Both these countries are close to the United States, while other countries in Latin America have better relations.\n\nReligion was a big reason for the problems. Writer Sally Frahm says that in the 1700s and 1800s, Americans did not like Catholic religion and kings, just as they later did not like communism. Like the later fight with the Soviet Union, the problem with Mexico was partly about different beliefs and partly about what each country wanted. The Americans and Mexicans got these bad feelings from England and Spain, who ruled them before they became free countries.\n\nWriters Diehl and Goerts found 17 fights between Mexico and the United States during these 57 years. Most of these fights were about bad people crossing the border and causing trouble. Both countries had to use their armies to stop these problems.\n\nWriter Schmitt says the fighting began to stop when Mexico started to need the United States for help. By the end of the 1800s, the United States stopped wanting Mexican land and instead wanted to do business with Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I had never heard of before. This sickness left me unable to work.\n\nI was a nurse then. I picked this job because I wanted to feel safe and secure, which I did not feel as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone and had very little money. I could not work anymore. Today, after fifteen years of getting help from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry a lot. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived through these years without help from my family and friends. When big problems come, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have problems, big and small. We cannot plan for everything, and some problems are too big to face alone.\n\nI think the United States should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to face everything alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong and independent. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing what they had. The people who moved west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nIt is good to be ready for problems. I keep emergency supplies like first aid items, water tablets, and food. I have lights, matches, and other useful things. If you can grow food or heat your home with wood, that is good too.\n\nBut most important: get to know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada. The religion has changed much since Buddha's time. For example, in the country of Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people take part in a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and regular people join this ceremony, even though Buddha never spoke about such events. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its beliefs over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside force,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhist people themselves. \"Outside force\" means changes that come from non-Buddhist people. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither try to help nor hurt Buddhism - we call these \"neutral.\" These forces might still affect Buddhism in some way.\n\nIt is important to understand the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three special things: Buddha, his teachings, and the community of Buddhist teachers. The teachings are written in three main groups of books. These books tell people how to live, explain rules to follow, and share deep ideas about life. The deep ideas say there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Understanding these ideas helps people break free from being born again and again. When people gain this understanding, they can end bad feelings like wanting too much, hating others, and being confused.\n\nThe books also give rules for living. Regular people must follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not act badly in love matters, and do not use things that harm the mind. Buddhist teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is about four main truths: first, that life includes suffering; second, that wanting things causes suffering; and third, that we can stop suffering."
