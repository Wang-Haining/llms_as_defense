            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must look at how each man explained his belief in the same God. While both made good points, neither gave a complete reason for believing in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. He believed that understanding God comes through faith. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. This way of believing without seeing clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He said we can prove God exists by using careful thinking and looking at the world around us. He thought we do not need faith to believe in God. This would help spread Christianity because people would not have to believe without proof. They could understand God through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gave five different reasons to show why God must exist. These reasons were about change, causes, why things exist, levels of goodness, and the order in nature. He showed that we can know God exists by seeing how the world works. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways of writing to create these feelings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. When he uses these colors later, readers remember the feelings they are supposed to have. This is very clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show things that are all the same, with white meaning rich and clean, while gray means old and tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, always wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white: Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom has on a white shirt when he sees Myrtle, and Catherine's face is white with powder.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to show regular, common things. Nick goes to work through the white streets of New York. The names of people at Gatsby's parties become gray words in Nick's notes. Many plain buildings and people are described as white or gray. In the poor area called the Valley of Ashes, everything is gray - the cars, the land, and even the people.\n\nAfter making readers understand what these colors mean, Fitzgerald uses them to tell us something about Daisy. When she appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else - just something Gatsby wants to have. This helps readers understand that maybe Daisy is not as special as Gatsby thinks she is.",
            "San Diego County grows many foods because the weather is warm and sunny. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and many other foods. They also get honey from bees and milk from cows. Many people want to buy food grown without chemicals, and they often must wait to get it. Some farms let people visit to see how food grows. People can also walk on these farms to see birds and enjoy nature.\n\nThese farms can get help from the government while making the land better for wild animals. They can also make money by teaching people about farming. When farmers grow food without chemicals, more kinds of plants and animals can live on the farm. But farming without chemicals is harder work. Farmers must pull out bad plants by hand and find natural ways to stop insects from eating the food. They also need to feed the soil naturally. Small farms often lose more food to problems than big farms do. Making the land good for wild animals takes more work too. Farmers must plant special plants and move their animals around the land carefully. Because this work is hard, farmers often need help with money and knowledge.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a big forest. Many special animals live in this area. Some of these animals are in danger of dying out, like certain rats, frogs, butterflies, and birds. \n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years.

He wanted someone to race with to the water and sit with him high in the pine tree behind their family's barn. But Doodle was born very sick, with a weak heart. The doctors said he might die, and if he lived, he would never be able to run or play hard games.\n\nThis made the older brother very sad and angry. He was so upset that he even thought about hurting baby Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him one day, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he truly loved his little brother, even if he sometimes did not act like it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as humans developed new tools, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. People first thought it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these simple comparisons can sometimes lead us to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses. These senses change things we feel, hear, and see into signals the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand that you are seeing a box more quickly.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. While your brain sees everything around you, it helps you pay attention only to what matters. For instance, you might not notice every small thing on the ground when you walk, but you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only seconds, while others can last for years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For words, your brain might remember how they look, sound, or what they mean. Short-term memories may stay active through signals moving between brain cells. Long-term memories are kept through changes in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea suggests that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government helped two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to buy these bad loans from banks. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money. This affected the whole country's money system.\n\nThe story starts in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. In 1999, a New York Times writer named Steven Holmes wrote about Fannie Mae. He said the government was pushing the company to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes warned this could cause problems if the economy became weak.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also sold these loans to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy, not just the housing market.\n\nWhen house prices finally fell, many banks that had bought these loans lost a lot of money. The five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank closed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and needed government help to survive.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is not good to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we still write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small thing about each person in the story. Both are wrong.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in simple words instead of showing them happen. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person too many facts at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the readers.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. This should not be told quickly in just two pages with only a few words from each person. Instead, the writer should show how the man acts and talks to prove his love. The writer should show how the woman's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about both people. When the man dies, readers will feel sad with the woman. They will understand her better.\n\nIn other words, a simple story needs more details to make it complete.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these details carefully. Sometimes you want to hurry and tell everything about a new person in the story. You might want to say they were in the Air Force, now work at night at a gas station, were married two times, have no children, like to fish, want to own the gas station, and what they ate that morning. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still happening. They only said he had attacked his wife several times and the police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. The story seemed very short. I think this might have been because Travis was a black man in a black area. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not talk about it much. When something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot more.\n\nThey then talked about a bullet hole found in a medical flying machine. They said it was from a small gun. People who help catch criminals are offering money to anyone who can help find who did this.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time saying the person who did it was a black man wearing a shirt with a hood. I thought they talked too much about his skin color.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he would be in prison for 300 months instead of saying 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a special kind of investment that follows the value of many different companies or things, like gold. You can buy and sell it easily, just like a company's stock.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are really buying small parts of many different companies at once. This helps make your investment safer because you are not putting all your money in just one company. ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investments.\n\nThere are some things to think about before buying ETFs. You must pay a small fee each time you buy or sell them. However, there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to buy the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in it separately. The ten biggest companies make up about 64% of the ETF's total value.\n\nWhen we looked at the numbers, we found something interesting. If you bought shares of just these ten companies in the same amounts as they are in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than by buying the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much the prices of these investments moved up and down over time. We did this by studying the standard deviation of both the ETF and the ten companies.",
            "Looking at the numbers shown in Figure 17, we saw that far fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the northeast United States, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This could explain part of the drop. December is also when the school term ends, and everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People may have simply forgotten to write down how they traveled. Also, December brings holidays and a long break when many students and teachers do not come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which may explain why that month's numbers were low. But this does not tell us why February's numbers were so low. Perhaps any project like this starts with great interest that naturally falls over time. To fight this drop, we created a special week in March to get people excited about sharing rides. This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our biggest problems was keeping people interested, especially during school breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother problem we faced is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of life in our country. So, we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways of getting to school. We gave out many prizes like food tickets for local eating places, coffee shops, and stores. We also gave tickets for back rubs and books. It would have been interesting to see what would happen if we had given bigger prizes, like a new bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with the project. The small prizes worked well at first, but telling people they could win a bike in December or a special car in January might have kept more people sending in their travel records.",
            "I studied some old films at the Library of Congress. These were special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. There were fifteen films that used special tricks to fool the eye. These tricks were made by careful cutting and joining of film parts.\n\nMost of these films were very simple. They were shot in one room with the camera staying in one place, like watching a stage show. The camera did not move around. It showed the whole scene from far away or middle distance. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nAt the start of the 1900s, a few films began to do things differently. Some used more than one scene put together. But most trick films were like watching a theater show from your seat. The actors moved from left to right across the screen, like they would on a stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera.\n\nIn one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), we can see this clearly. The actors come in from the right side and move back and forth. When they leave the picture, the camera stays still.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. They never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like sitting in a theater, where you see everything happening on the stage at once. The actors stayed away from the camera, so there were no close views.\n\nMost of these early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute. They showed simple magic tricks, like making people appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene to people watching, they were actually made of several pieces of film joined together. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), if you look carefully, you can see where they cut the film to make it look like her head was cut off.",
            "The Gothic Novel is both old and new at the same time. Some people have said these books are too simple, while others praise them for creating feelings of fear and wonder. The first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed old story-telling methods with new ways of writing to create something different. \n\nGothic stories use many ideas from the middle ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought gothic things were old-fashioned compared to new ideas. But the Gothic Novel was special because it mixed old dramatic stories with new ways of showing how characters think and feel. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic novels is the code of honor called chivalry. This idea comes from the middle ages, when knights had to follow strict rules about being brave and good. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more honor and goodness. When Walpole wrote his book, his country was having political problems. He may have thought that people in his time were not as good or moral as people in the past.\n\nWe can see this in his book through characters like Frederic. Before we meet him, we learn that he is a prince who has faced many hard times. He shows the qualities of an honorable knight, though Walpole makes these qualities very strong to make a point about what society was missing.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts in moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping goods ready, choosing where to work, moving goods around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They look at what people want to buy in stores. This helps them decide what customers need. Then they pick the best places to make these things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything. They even have rules about what workers should wear and how trucks should bring goods to stores.\n\nThe second main part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each workplace can do best. Sometimes, one thing is made in many different places. Each place has different machines, workers, and special skills. Leaders choose which place should do each part of the work. Sometimes, they ask other companies to help make things. They do this to work faster and keep costs low while still making good things.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often told stories about rich people and included many small details. Two books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the people in the stories and why they acted as they did.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we see this through Oliver's dreams and times when he is not fully awake. In one part of the story, Oliver is shot and hurt. While he is trying to find help, his mind mixes what is real with what is not real. He thinks he hears two bad men, Sikes and Crackit, talking. He hears guns being fired and people shouting. Lights flash before his eyes. Someone pulls him away, but he does not know who. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not stop.\n\nThis part of the story shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot even try to help himself when he is in danger. It seems that the bad man Fagin has started to break Oliver's spirit. In normal times, anyone would try to save their own life, but Oliver does not even try.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver. The day passes quickly, as if there is no day at all. The night feels both very long because it is so quiet, and very short because the hours move fast.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. I was good at teaching English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others gave him much trouble. Adrian spoke English very well, and I knew he came from a Latin American family.\n\nOne day, I met Adrian's mother when I was watching some students. She could not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we could talk. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well. I hope he reads better now.\n\nI tell this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard. We know this problem exists, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. We need many ways to help. Teaching in two languages, putting students in English-speaking classes, having special teachers, and English learning classes are all good ideas. But we need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just Spanish-speaking ones. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people think this is a waste, but they are wrong. If we used this way of teaching in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages.",
            "Many people learn from a young age that there is something greater than themselves in the world. Some learn about this at church, while others go to different places of worship, or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others completely reject these ideas, believing only in what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to follow another. Whatever way we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for something to help guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked which bird he liked best. We sat on our front porch, hearing rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water poured from the roof's edge, falling on the plants below. He looked out at the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were too big now. His hair was thinner too. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt very alone and scared. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because talking about it would make everything feel too real. I gave him a hug, then moved my chair closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The doctors tried to help him with strong medicine, but it only made him live longer in pain. I could not understand why. I asked myself why this would happen if there was a God. At night, I stopped praying. I thought that if God was real, he no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He was mainly a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming, which he thought was the best job, and this affected his views on state power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have natural rights, and that these rights work together. If you take away one right, you harm all the others. He said the government should not be able to touch these rights. In nature, he said, strong and clever but bad people would win, but in a proper society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He was very clear about right and wrong. He said that since people run government, government shows both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were those that protect what people own, help farming grow, and stop big business from having too much power. He believed that even if bad people ran the government, good rules would make it work fairly. Taylor thought people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people take from others instead of helping everyone.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words was not enough - people needed to understand what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at what was in front of me. My mind saw everything but felt nothing. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I wasn't really thinking, just seeing.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was young. The book teaches many things about art. One lesson is to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, looking down at the bowl, I couldn't think about art frames. I could only stand and look. Famous artists like Picasso used blue colors, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists used many colors. If I were an artist, this would be my brown picture, my brown story.\n\nMy fingers touched the tool I needed. My hand moved through the air as my mind told it what to do. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand pushed the toilet handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt tight around my neck. I was not happy about what someone had left in the bathroom at the store where I worked. After trying to flush several times, I pulled some toilet paper from the wall.

            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things make driving dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health says that young people's brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough practice is also a big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age, which they often do. A study by researchers in Southern California showed that having young passengers in the car makes crashes more likely.\n\nSome states try to make young drivers safer by giving them special licenses. These licenses say when they can drive and do not let them carry other young people in their cars.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that the youngest drivers cannot handle the dangers of driving safely. One expert who studies how people think believes even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often do dangerous things just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more will die on the roads. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could make the problem worse.\n\nThere is a simple way to fix this. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to practice with an adult and learn the rules. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would help keep young people safe everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it explains what the disorder is. Then, it shows how doctors find it in patients. Finally, it tells how teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a brain problem that makes it hard for people to understand what they hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally. However, their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is other noise nearby, or they may find it hard to tell where sounds are coming from.\n\nDoctors first noticed this problem in the 1950s. They saw it in children who had trouble talking and understanding others. Since then, many doctors have studied CAPD and created tests to find it in patients.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds come from. They might find it hard to tell different sounds apart. They might not understand changes in how people speak, like when someone is joking. They might also have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person listens and responds to different sounds. They may ask questions about how well the person understands speech in different situations. They might also give special listening tests. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Also, doctors do not know what causes this problem. The tests often involve asking people to listen to different words or numbers at the same time and then repeat what they heard.",
            "I want to study to become a social worker. My goal is to work for the government helping children who have been hurt by their families. I want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do better at my job. These things are important not just for work, but also to me as a person.\n\nI have always wanted to help people, but I was not sure what kind of work to do. In school, I saw many young people run away from their problems. Some dealt with their troubles in ways that were not good. This made me want to study how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about my future. \n\nThat summer, I met a young boy at my friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my education in studying how people think. They asked me to talk to the parents because they could not do anything to help the boy. The parents seemed worried and said their son was just causing trouble. After this, I knew I wanted to be a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is important, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like being told I must be like everyone else. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how the body works and what we get from our parents. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nSleep problems can be grouped in different ways. Some start on their own, while others happen because of mental health issues or other health problems. The most common sleep problem is when people cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. This is called insomnia. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might walk in their sleep or have bad dreams.\n\nScientists found that special cells in the brain help control when we are awake or asleep. They did tests with mice to learn how these brain cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nThis information helps us understand why some people have trouble sleeping. If someone's parents had sleep problems, they might get the same problems. This can make life hard because people need good sleep to do well at school or work. When people cannot sleep well, it affects many parts of their daily life.",
            "I have been a student at this university for more than two years now. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in a room far on the east side of school. Walking from my room to my classes near the middle of school could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that years ago, the east living areas were far from other buildings, with much empty land between them. Now that empty space has new sports fields and big buildings. As our school grows bigger, it becomes harder to get from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. However, just having bicycles is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make it easier for bicycle riders.\n\nI talked to a friend who just started riding his bicycle again after stopping for many years. He said he did not know why he ever stopped. \"Bicycles are wonderful,\" he said. \"For some time, people thought bicycles were not good to use, but they are the best way to move around.\" Riding a bicycle is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride very far.\n\nI now live away from the school area, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Getting a bicycle was the best thing I did this year. Every day, I have class in a building that would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bicycle, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that the most direct road is often hard to use, whether walking or riding. \n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bicycle, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to just one of my classes would take 40 more minutes each day. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about going to other classes and meetings, it takes too much time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people are taught to value the group more than themselves. They learn from birth to only care about being happy right now.\n\nThe people in this world are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders. They can only think in ways that these leaders allow. Huxley shows how big businesses and their systems can harm society. The story points out problems he saw growing in the economy of his time.\n\nIn the book, regular people do not understand how money and power really work. They only think about what they can get for themselves. The lower classes in the story, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think freely. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and spend money. The top leader uses this to control them. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and they believe in a system that keeps them down. Even most of the upper classes, called Alpha and Beta, accept things as they are.\n\nPeople in this future world do not form real friendships or relationships. Even the main characters seem empty, without much personality. This might show how Huxley thought technology and business control could take away people's ability to think and feel freely. There is no love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships. Each group accepts their place in society without question. They obey and keep buying things, believing this makes them better, just as their leaders want them to think.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at my local college. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that promoted peace or conflict. This question seems even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news reports about Islam have changed. At first, many news stories were negative. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I learned before. I used to think Muhammad made people join his religion by force when he took control of their lands. However, the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him freely when they saw the truth in his words.\n\nI notice that some stories about Muhammad are very similar to stories about Jesus. For example, there is a story where Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This reminds me of Jesus feeding many people. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a humble teacher who did special things. This bothers me because it seems to copy the special acts of Jesus.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslims. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. This does not match with other things I have learned about how Muhammad gained power. I wonder if Muslims today know the full story of their religion's beginning.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christians will slowly remove added ideas until only Jesus' original teaching about God remains.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different Christian groups with different ideas, more people will share the same beliefs.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome first tried to destroy Christians, but later became Christian itself. America moved from having slaves to having African-American leaders. The coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for Jesus' original message, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just their simple meaning.\n\nLooking back in history, we find Judaism came before Christianity. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in many ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from tall chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about the people or animals their factories harm. They ignore the dirty smoke from their buildings and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They will do anything to save or make more money. Workers might lose their jobs without warning, and the companies do not help them find new work. During this time, there were few laws to protect workers. This meant owners could make people work long hours in dangerous places. The workers had to accept these bad conditions both at work and in their homes. There was no one to help them or give them information about their rights.\n\nWhile there were some worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the poor workers instead of helping them. The workers could not escape their hard lives. Many of them came from other countries and were very poor. They had to depend on cruel business owners who treated them like slaves. In these terrible conditions, people often became hopeless and desperate.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his better works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. While the word appeared in very old writing, Poe likely got it from more recent German writing.\n\nPoe read many German writers. One of these writers was named Goethe, who wrote a famous story called \"Faust.\" Inside \"Faust\" was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king becomes very sad, drinks too much, and finally walks to a high place where he throws the cup into the sea and dies.\n\nThe king in Goethe's poem and the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very much alike. Both are very sad and alone. This might show how Poe felt about his own problems with drinking. Poe used the word \"Thule\" in another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" around the same time.\n\nWhen we read \"Dream-Land,\" we see a dark, lonely place where the speaker sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad world of the King of Thule. It seems Poe may have been writing about the same kind of feelings that Goethe wrote about in his poem.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing because Goethe was very famous at that time. Many people were making new versions of Goethe's works, so Poe would have had many chances to read them. Also, other writers Poe respected, like Tennyson, spoke highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Can a store be forced to pay extra money as punishment in California if a customer gets hurt from falling on spilled food when the store manager knew about the danger but did nothing?\n\nHere are the important facts: A woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back badly. The fall happened because there was applesauce on the floor. Two workers had told the store manager about the spilled applesauce earlier. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. Five other people had fallen in the same store that year.\n\nThe law in California says stores must pay extra money as punishment if they do very bad things that hurt people. The store must know that what they are doing could hurt someone, and they must choose not to fix the problem anyway.\n\nIn this case, the manager knew about the spill for thirty minutes before Ms. Palmer fell. He also knew that other people had fallen in his store before. He still chose not to clean up the spill or ask someone else to do it. Because he knew about the danger but did nothing, a judge will probably let Ms. Palmer ask for extra money as punishment.\n\nThe store might have to pay both for Ms. Palmer's medical care and extra money to teach them to be more careful in the future. This is because the manager's choice to ignore the spill was very wrong, especially since he knew it could hurt someone.",
            "She always felt she needed something. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live, always wondering about her feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely fought with each other or with her. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. Her parents were calm, but she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not quiet. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" Her mother was on the floor, clearly hurting. She kept saying \"ow\" over and over. The daughter went to her mother to help. \"Please... take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me how to lift you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove away.\n\nThe hospital always smells clean but scary. The daughter did not notice this because she could only think about her mother. She carried her mother in quickly and called for help. doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away to check her. The daughter had to wait and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen while trying to reach something high up in the kitchen.",
            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The diet includes lots of plants, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. It limits foods from animals. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood test results in heavy people.\n\nThe researchers watched 74,886 women for 20 years. These women were nurses between 38 and 63 years old. When the study began, none had heart problems or diabetes. Six times during the study, the women told researchers what they ate by filling out food forms. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death records to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and medicine use.\n\nTo understand eating patterns better, they averaged what each woman ate over time. They also considered other things that could affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nAfter studying the numbers carefully, they found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems. During the 20 years, 2,391 women had heart attacks, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 29% less chance of having heart problems compared to those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma. \n\nBurma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Asia. Since 1962, military leaders have controlled the country with force. In 2007, people went into the streets to protest against the government. Many of these protesters were Buddhist religious men wearing orange clothes. People called these protests the \"Orange Movement\" because of the clothes these men wore.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. Then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news writers from other countries from doing their work. They killed a news photographer from Japan who was taking pictures of the protests. The government said thirteen people died. However, a military officer who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nSadly, this kind of violence has happened many times in history. Governments often try to stop people who speak against them. This happened in China in 1989, when students and workers gathered in a place called Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people died there. In the 1990s, one group in Rwanda killed many people from another group. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible events show us how some leaders will do anything to keep power. They remind us why we must speak up when we see wrong things happening in the world.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and helped create a special sound in jazz music. While he played the piano, his real skill was in writing music that made each person in his band sound their best.\n\nEllington knew how to write music that let players make their own special sounds. He also knew how to make all the different instruments work together to create beautiful music. He understood what each player could do best, and he used this knowledge to write some of the most important jazz music ever made.\n\nThe Grove Music book talks about how Ellington used the human voice in new ways. In his song \"Creole Love Call,\" he used the voice like another instrument in the band, without any words. This was something new at the time. The song shows how well he could write for different players. It is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: Voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: Quiet trumpet plays alone\nPart 3: High clarinet plays with soft piano\nPart 4: Full band plays together\nPart 5: Wind instruments lead, with other instruments adding beat\nPart 6: Voice and winds play together again, with voice making special sounds\n\nThe song ends with a voice run and an unusual sound from the trombone.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington continued to use voices and instruments in special ways. He had singers make sounds like instruments, and he had instruments make sounds like voices. This helped create the special sound that made his music famous.",
            "How do living things change over time? What guides these changes? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these animals grow their shells and how the shells have changed over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells. We put the numbers we found into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how living Prunum grow to better understand how these animals have changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. Each circle is called a whorl. The whorls wrap around the middle of the shell, which is called the columella. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Then count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that follow a path through space. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can show this path with pictures and math. Once we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough in keeping mothers and children healthy. There are many reasons for this, which suggest the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional birth helpers who cannot help if there are serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nSpecial operations to help difficult births (called c-sections) are not common enough - only 4 out of 100 births. In cities, 7 out of 100 births are c-sections, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nTo make things better, Indonesia must decide how to provide more health services. They can either make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they can make the whole health system stronger. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after heavy metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of heavy metal music, and this continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of heavy metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand today's heavy metal music, we must understand how it grew and changed.\n\nHeavy metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more dramatic shows. Heavy metal musicians must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy metal was different from other popular music because it showed the dark side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first heavy metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and a wild sound that went up and down, like the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album to prove they could make powerful music.",
            "Many years before artists started making strange dream pictures, Henri Rousseau was already painting his own dreams. His 1910 painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted in life. From the start, he hoped other artists would accept and praise his work, but this was not easy to achieve. \"The Dream\" shows how Rousseau had to choose between two paths: either paint like others to be accepted, or follow his own special way of making art.\n\nTo understand this painting better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father fixed metal items and sold hardware, making enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the city collecting money from people at gates until he was forty years old. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His life was very sad at times. His first wife died, and before that, eight of their babies died. Only one child lived, a daughter named Julia. To feel better, he started painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting late in life and had no training. He worked at the same time as many famous artists like Matisse. While Matisse tried very hard not to paint like everyone else, Rousseau actually wanted to paint pictures that looked like what others were doing, so the art world would accept him.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or through what happens to us. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study what makes things right or beautiful, we try to explain why we feel the way we do. We do not make rules about how to create beautiful things or how to be good.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we cannot fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss why the Mona Lisa is a great painting, they might talk about colors or shapes. But these words do not really tell us why it is special. Often, when someone talks about art they love, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have something special that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that stories tell us things that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. The same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI believe art and right actions are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way we cannot fully explain. This is especially true with stories and books. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life. They help us think about what is right and wrong, just as we must do in our own lives.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's special way of life comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. The Roman writer Tacitus said it came from a group called the Tungrians. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars. He learned this name from people called the Gauls. Some think the name comes from the word for \"spear,\" while others say it means \"to shout\" in an old language.\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the German people were different from others. He thought they had always lived in their land and did not come from somewhere else. He asked why anyone would want to leave warm places like Asia or Africa to live in the cold, wild German lands.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania, but they did trade with the German people. Sometimes Roman armies would go into Germania to get goods or fight. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and found in their land. Many German men also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, we see how hiding one's true self can help someone for a time, but can also cause problems. The story shows that people must eventually return to their real selves, or they might lose who they truly are. When someone stops hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind finding out they were fooled, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the story, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and must hide her women's clothes.\n\nViola arrives in a strange place and thinks she must act like a man to protect herself. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must deal with her own feelings for Orsino, who thinks she is a man.\n\nToday's readers might see the play differently. It shows how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings into the open. This is true for both Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have deeper, hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare likely wanted to make fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (who she knows as Cesario) to Sebastian. After this, she starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "German control of its colonies was often cruel, especially in South West Africa where many local people were killed. However, the way Germans ruled their colonies was different in each place. This was also true for schools. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other writers also said good things about German schools in places like Kamerun.\n\nThe story was very different in South West Africa, which is now called Namibia. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left this work to church groups and gave them little help. The government did spend money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write. This happened because of many different reasons in society, government, and business.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most of these books were written in German during the early 1900s when Germany still controlled these places. These early books just told what the schools were like. Later, books in English looked at how schools were different in each colony. One important writer named Cohen studied schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa made its schools very different from other colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, even though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and the Southwest area.\n\nThe two countries had many differences. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. They also fought over land and other important things. This kind of problem is common between countries that share a border.\n\nThe United States has had difficult relationships with few countries in Latin America. Mexico and Cuba are the main examples because they are very close to the United States. Other Latin American countries have usually been friendly with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like the Catholic religion that was common in Mexico. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about problems at the border. Bad people would cross the border to cause trouble in both countries. This continued until both countries put soldiers at the border to stop it.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the late 1800s, the United States was no longer trying to take Mexican land. Instead, American businesses wanted to work in Mexico. This helped make the two countries more friendly.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I did not know about. This made me unable to work or do many normal things.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of getting help money from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry much. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can promise anything, and sometimes problems are too big to fix alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing. The people who went west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready for problems. I have emergency supplies: medical things, water cleaning tablets, and window covers. I have lights, batteries, matches, and stored food. If you can grow food or have a wood stove, that is good.\n\nBut most important: know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as the Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. In Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people hold a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and common people join this event. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its basic ideas over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside forces,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhists themselves. \"Outside forces\" come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither help nor hurt Buddhism on purpose - we call these \"neutral,\" though they might still affect the religion.\n\nThe main ideas of Buddhism are important to understand. Buddhists believe in three special things: the Buddha (their teacher), the Dhamma (their holy books), and the Sangha (their religious community). Their holy books are split into three parts. One part has Buddha's teachings, another has rules for living, and the third part talks about deep ideas about life.\n\nThese deep ideas include beliefs that there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Buddhists believe people are born again and again until they understand these truths. When someone fully understands, they stop wanting things too much, stop hating, and stop being confused about life.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in relationships, and do not use drugs or alcohol. Religious teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is that life includes suffering, that wanting things causes suffering, and that people can learn to end their suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The way people think and act in different places affects how they make deals. We cannot say all people from one country act the same way. For example, it is wrong to say all people from Russia or Japan act in one way. It is better to learn how people's beliefs affect the way they talk about business.\n\nWhen we meet people from other places, we often think about how they are different from us. To understand people from other places, we need to learn about their history and ideas. We should not try to change how they think or act. This is very important when we want to make deals with them, especially if we need their help more than they need ours. When we go to their country, we should show respect for their ways of doing things.\n\nDifferent groups have different ways of working, even in the same country. Companies often have their own ways of doing things. Some want workers to stay late, while others let workers go home early. We can see how companies are different in how workers dress, how they talk to each other, and who they choose to hire. Some companies want workers to help poor people, while others only give money to special groups. In America, companies in different cities or areas can be very different from each other.\n\nIt is very important to understand what people think is right or wrong. In some places, people think it is very important not to make others look bad. In these places, someone making a deal will not say bad things about their company or their boss. In other places, people think it is good to push hard to get what they want. Before making deals, we should think about these differences. But it is also good to learn about the person we are dealing with as an individual.",
            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must look at how each man explained his belief in the same God. While both made good points, neither gave a complete reason for believing in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. He believed that understanding God comes through faith. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. This way of believing without seeing clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He said we can prove God exists by using careful thinking and looking at the world around us. He thought we do not need faith to believe in God. This would help spread Christianity because people would not have to believe without proof. They could understand God through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gave five different reasons to show why God must exist. These reasons were about change, causes, why things exist, levels of goodness, and the order in nature. He showed that we can know God exists by seeing how the world works. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways of writing to create these feelings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. When he uses these colors later, readers remember the feelings they are supposed to have. This is very clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show things that are all the same, with white meaning rich and clean, while gray means old and tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, always wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white: Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom has on a white shirt when he sees Myrtle, and Catherine's face is white with powder.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to show regular, common things. Nick goes to work through the white streets of New York. The names of people at Gatsby's parties become gray words in Nick's notes. Many plain buildings and people are described as white or gray. In the poor area called the Valley of Ashes, everything is gray - the cars, the land, and even the people.\n\nAfter making readers understand what these colors mean, Fitzgerald uses them to tell us something about Daisy. When she appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else - just something Gatsby wants to have. This helps readers understand that maybe Daisy is not as special as Gatsby thinks she is.",
            "San Diego County grows many foods because the weather is warm and sunny. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and many other foods. They also get honey from bees and milk from cows. Many people want to buy food grown without chemicals, and they often must wait to get it. Some farms let people visit to see how food grows. People can also walk on these farms to see birds and enjoy nature.\n\nThese farms can get help from the government while making the land better for wild animals. They can also make money by teaching people about farming. When farmers grow food without chemicals, more kinds of plants and animals can live on the farm. But farming without chemicals is harder work. Farmers must pull out bad plants by hand and find natural ways to stop insects from eating the food. They also need to feed the soil naturally. Small farms often lose more food to problems than big farms do. Making the land good for wild animals takes more work too. Farmers must plant special plants and move their animals around the land carefully. Because this work is hard, farmers often need help with money and knowledge.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a big forest. Many special animals live in this area. Some of these animals are in danger of dying out, like certain rats, frogs, butterflies, and birds. \n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood. Someone got this land from the government long ago and probably used it for cows or wood since then.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked up ways the government could help a small farmer. I also found another farm nearby that grows food without chemicals to use as an example.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection brings many feelings like love, pride, anger, and sometimes even mean thoughts. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, it is like looking in a mirror. When times are very hard, this connection shows its true nature, whether good or bad. These feelings can lead to serious results.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show us what this means. The older brother tells the story about his younger brother, Doodle. The story takes place in a beautiful green area where the two boys try to do something that cannot succeed. The older brother feels both very proud and very sad at different times, and in the end, only one brother lives.\n\nThe older brother's actions come from his pride. When Doodle was born, the older brother wanted someone to play with and teach things to. He wanted a brother who could run, jump, and climb trees with him. He wanted someone to race with to the water and sit with him high in the pine tree behind their family's barn. But Doodle was born very sick, with a weak heart. The doctors said he might die, and if he lived, he would never be able to run or play hard games.\n\nThis made the older brother very sad and angry. He was so upset that he even thought about hurting baby Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him one day, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he truly loved his little brother, even if he sometimes did not act like it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as humans developed new tools, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. People first thought it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these simple comparisons can sometimes lead us to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses. These senses change things we feel, hear, and see into signals the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand that you are seeing a box more quickly.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. While your brain sees everything around you, it helps you pay attention only to what matters. For instance, you might not notice every small thing on the ground when you walk, but you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only seconds, while others can last for years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For words, your brain might remember how they look, sound, or what they mean. Short-term memories may stay active through signals moving between brain cells. Long-term memories are kept through changes in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea suggests that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government helped two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to buy these bad loans from banks. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money. This affected the whole country's money system.\n\nThe story starts in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. In 1999, a New York Times writer named Steven Holmes wrote about Fannie Mae. He said the government was pushing the company to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes warned this could cause problems if the economy became weak.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also sold these loans to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy, not just the housing market.\n\nWhen house prices finally fell, many banks that had bought these loans lost a lot of money. The five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank closed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and needed government help to survive.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is not good to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we still write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small thing about each person in the story. Both are wrong.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in simple words instead of showing them happen. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person too many facts at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the readers.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. This should not be told quickly in just two pages with only a few words from each person. Instead, the writer should show how the man acts and talks to prove his love. The writer should show how the woman's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about both people. When the man dies, readers will feel sad with the woman. They will understand her better.\n\nIn other words, a simple story needs more details to make it complete.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these details carefully. Sometimes you want to hurry and tell everything about a new person in the story. You might want to say they were in the Air Force, now work at night at a gas station, were married two times, have no children, like to fish, want to own the gas station, and what they ate that morning. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still happening. They only said he had attacked his wife several times and the police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. The story seemed very short. I think this might have been because Travis was a black man in a black area. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not talk about it much. When something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot more.\n\nThey then talked about a bullet hole found in a medical flying machine. They said it was from a small gun. People who help catch criminals are offering money to anyone who can help find who did this.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time saying the person who did it was a black man wearing a shirt with a hood. I thought they talked too much about his skin color.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he would be in prison for 300 months instead of saying 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a special kind of investment that follows the value of many different companies or things, like gold. You can buy and sell it easily, just like a company's stock.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are really buying small parts of many different companies at once. This helps make your investment safer because you are not putting all your money in just one company. ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investments.\n\nThere are some things to think about before buying ETFs. You must pay a small fee each time you buy or sell them. However, there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to buy the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in it separately. The ten biggest companies make up about 64% of the ETF's total value.\n\nWhen we looked at the numbers, we found something interesting. If you bought shares of just these ten companies in the same amounts as they are in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than by buying the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much the prices of these investments moved up and down over time. We did this by studying the standard deviation of both the ETF and the ten companies.",
            "Looking at the numbers shown in Figure 17, we saw that far fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the northeast United States, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This could explain part of the drop. December is also when the school term ends, and everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People may have simply forgotten to write down how they traveled. Also, December brings holidays and a long break when many students and teachers do not come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which may explain why that month's numbers were low. But this does not tell us why February's numbers were so low. Perhaps any project like this starts with great interest that naturally falls over time. To fight this drop, we created a special week in March to get people excited about sharing rides. This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our biggest problems was keeping people interested, especially during school breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother problem we faced is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of life in our country. So, we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways of getting to school. We gave out many prizes like food tickets for local eating places, coffee shops, and stores. We also gave tickets for back rubs and books. It would have been interesting to see what would happen if we had given bigger prizes, like a new bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with the project. The small prizes worked well at first, but telling people they could win a bike in December or a special car in January might have kept more people sending in their travel records.",
            "I studied some old films at the Library of Congress. These were special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. There were fifteen films that used special tricks to fool the eye. These tricks were made by careful cutting and joining of film parts.\n\nMost of these films were very simple. They were shot in one room with the camera staying in one place, like watching a stage show. The camera did not move around. It showed the whole scene from far away or middle distance. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nAt the start of the 1900s, a few films began to do things differently. Some used more than one scene put together. But most trick films were like watching a theater show from your seat. The actors moved from left to right across the screen, like they would on a stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera.\n\nIn one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), we can see this clearly. The actors come in from the right side and move back and forth. When they leave the picture, the camera stays still.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. They never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like sitting in a theater, where you see everything happening on the stage at once. The actors stayed away from the camera, so there were no close views.\n\nMost of these early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute. They showed simple magic tricks, like making people appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene to people watching, they were actually made of several pieces of film joined together. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), if you look carefully, you can see where they cut the film to make it look like her head was cut off.",
            "The Gothic Novel is both old and new at the same time. Some people have said these books are too simple, while others praise them for creating feelings of fear and wonder. The first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed old story-telling methods with new ways of writing to create something different. \n\nGothic stories use many ideas from the middle ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought gothic things were old-fashioned compared to new ideas. But the Gothic Novel was special because it mixed old dramatic stories with new ways of showing how characters think and feel. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic novels is the code of honor called chivalry. This idea comes from the middle ages, when knights had to follow strict rules about being brave and good. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more honor and goodness. When Walpole wrote his book, his country was having political problems. He may have thought that people in his time were not as good or moral as people in the past.\n\nWe can see this in his book through characters like Frederic. Before we meet him, we learn that he is a prince who has faced many hard times. He shows the qualities of an honorable knight, though Walpole makes these qualities very strong to make a point about what society was missing.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts in moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping goods ready, choosing where to work, moving goods around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They look at what people want to buy in stores. This helps them decide what customers need. Then they pick the best places to make these things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything. They even have rules about what workers should wear and how trucks should bring goods to stores.\n\nThe second main part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each workplace can do best. Sometimes, one thing is made in many different places. Each place has different machines, workers, and special skills. Leaders choose which place should do each part of the work. Sometimes, they ask other companies to help make things. They do this to work faster and keep costs low while still making good things.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often told stories about rich people and included many small details. Two books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the people in the stories and why they acted as they did.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we see this through Oliver's dreams and times when he is not fully awake. In one part of the story, Oliver is shot and hurt. While he is trying to find help, his mind mixes what is real with what is not real. He thinks he hears two bad men, Sikes and Crackit, talking. He hears guns being fired and people shouting. Lights flash before his eyes. Someone pulls him away, but he does not know who. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not stop.\n\nThis part of the story shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot even try to help himself when he is in danger. It seems that the bad man Fagin has started to break Oliver's spirit. In normal times, anyone would try to save their own life, but Oliver does not even try.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver. The day passes quickly, as if there is no day at all. The night feels both very long because it is so quiet, and very short because the hours move fast.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. I was good at teaching English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others gave him much trouble. Adrian spoke English very well, and I knew he came from a Latin American family.\n\nOne day, I met Adrian's mother when I was watching some students. She could not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we could talk. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well. I hope he reads better now.\n\nI tell this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard. We know this problem exists, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. We need many ways to help. Teaching in two languages, putting students in English-speaking classes, having special teachers, and English learning classes are all good ideas. But we need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just Spanish-speaking ones. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people think this is a waste, but they are wrong. If we used this way of teaching in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages.",
            "Many people learn from a young age that there is something greater than themselves in the world. Some learn about this at church, while others go to different places of worship, or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others completely reject these ideas, believing only in what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to follow another. Whatever way we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for something to help guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked which bird he liked best. We sat on our front porch, hearing rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water poured from the roof's edge, falling on the plants below. He looked out at the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were too big now. His hair was thinner too. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt very alone and scared. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because talking about it would make everything feel too real. I gave him a hug, then moved my chair closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The doctors tried to help him with strong medicine, but it only made him live longer in pain. I could not understand why. I asked myself why this would happen if there was a God. At night, I stopped praying. I thought that if God was real, he no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He was mainly a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming, which he thought was the best job, and this affected his views on state power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have natural rights, and that these rights work together. If you take away one right, you harm all the others. He said the government should not be able to touch these rights. In nature, he said, strong and clever but bad people would win, but in a proper society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He was very clear about right and wrong. He said that since people run government, government shows both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were those that protect what people own, help farming grow, and stop big business from having too much power. He believed that even if bad people ran the government, good rules would make it work fairly. Taylor thought people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people take from others instead of helping everyone.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words was not enough - people needed to understand what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at what was in front of me. My mind saw everything but felt nothing. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I wasn't really thinking, just seeing.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was young. The book teaches many things about art. One lesson is to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, looking down at the bowl, I couldn't think about art frames. I could only stand and look. Famous artists like Picasso used blue colors, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists used many colors. If I were an artist, this would be my brown picture, my brown story.\n\nMy fingers touched the tool I needed. My hand moved through the air as my mind told it what to do. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand pushed the toilet handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt tight around my neck. I was not happy about what someone had left in the bathroom at the store where I worked. After trying to flush several times, I pulled some toilet paper from the wall. I wrapped my hand in paper until it looked like a cooking glove. Then, like someone reaching into an oven for food, I had to reach into the toilet bowl...",
            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things make driving dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health says that young people's brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough practice is also a big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age, which they often do. A study by researchers in Southern California showed that having young passengers in the car makes crashes more likely.\n\nSome states try to make young drivers safer by giving them special licenses. These licenses say when they can drive and do not let them carry other young people in their cars.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that the youngest drivers cannot handle the dangers of driving safely. One expert who studies how people think believes even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often do dangerous things just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more will die on the roads. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could make the problem worse.\n\nThere is a simple way to fix this. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to practice with an adult and learn the rules. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would help keep young people safe everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it explains what the disorder is. Then, it shows how doctors find it in patients. Finally, it tells how teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a brain problem that makes it hard for people to understand what they hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally. However, their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is other noise nearby, or they may find it hard to tell where sounds are coming from.\n\nDoctors first noticed this problem in the 1950s. They saw it in children who had trouble talking and understanding others. Since then, many doctors have studied CAPD and created tests to find it in patients.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds come from. They might find it hard to tell different sounds apart. They might not understand changes in how people speak, like when someone is joking. They might also have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person listens and responds to different sounds. They may ask questions about how well the person understands speech in different situations. They might also give special listening tests. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Also, doctors do not know what causes this problem. The tests often involve asking people to listen to different words or numbers at the same time and then repeat what they heard.",
            "I want to study to become a social worker. My goal is to work for the government helping children who have been hurt by their families. I want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do better at my job. These things are important not just for work, but also to me as a person.\n\nI have always wanted to help people, but I was not sure what kind of work to do. In school, I saw many young people run away from their problems. Some dealt with their troubles in ways that were not good. This made me want to study how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about my future. \n\nThat summer, I met a young boy at my friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my education in studying how people think. They asked me to talk to the parents because they could not do anything to help the boy. The parents seemed worried and said their son was just causing trouble. After this, I knew I wanted to be a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is important, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like being told I must be like everyone else. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly. I will keep working to make sure everyone is treated fairly.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems, especially when people cannot sleep well. One way looks at how the body works and what we get from our parents. The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nSleep problems can be grouped in different ways. Some start on their own, while others happen because of mental health issues or other health problems. The most common sleep problem is when people cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. This is called insomnia. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might walk in their sleep or have bad dreams.\n\nScientists found that special cells in the brain help control when we are awake or asleep. They did tests with mice to learn how these brain cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nThis information helps us understand why some people have trouble sleeping. If someone's parents had sleep problems, they might get the same problems. This can make life hard because people need good sleep to do well at school or work. When people cannot sleep well, it affects many parts of their daily life.",
            "I have been a student at this university for more than two years now. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in a room far on the east side of school. Walking from my room to my classes near the middle of school could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that years ago, the east living areas were far from other buildings, with much empty land between them. Now that empty space has new sports fields and big buildings. As our school grows bigger, it becomes harder to get from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. However, just having bicycles is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make it easier for bicycle riders.\n\nI talked to a friend who just started riding his bicycle again after stopping for many years. He said he did not know why he ever stopped. \"Bicycles are wonderful,\" he said. \"For some time, people thought bicycles were not good to use, but they are the best way to move around.\" Riding a bicycle is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride very far.\n\nI now live away from the school area, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Getting a bicycle was the best thing I did this year. Every day, I have class in a building that would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bicycle, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that the most direct road is often hard to use, whether walking or riding. \n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bicycle, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to just one of my classes would take 40 more minutes each day. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about going to other classes and meetings, it takes too much time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people are taught to value the group more than themselves. They learn from birth to only care about being happy right now.\n\nThe people in this world are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders. They can only think in ways that these leaders allow. Huxley shows how big businesses and their systems can harm society. The story points out problems he saw growing in the economy of his time.\n\nIn the book, regular people do not understand how money and power really work. They only think about what they can get for themselves. The lower classes in the story, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think freely. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and spend money. The top leader uses this to control them. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and they believe in a system that keeps them down. Even most of the upper classes, called Alpha and Beta, accept things as they are.\n\nPeople in this future world do not form real friendships or relationships. Even the main characters seem empty, without much personality. This might show how Huxley thought technology and business control could take away people's ability to think and feel freely. There is no love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships. Each group accepts their place in society without question. They obey and keep buying things, believing this makes them better, just as their leaders want them to think.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at my local college. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that promoted peace or conflict. This question seems even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news reports about Islam have changed. At first, many news stories were negative. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I learned before. I used to think Muhammad made people join his religion by force when he took control of their lands. However, the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him freely when they saw the truth in his words.\n\nI notice that some stories about Muhammad are very similar to stories about Jesus. For example, there is a story where Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This reminds me of Jesus feeding many people. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a humble teacher who did special things. This bothers me because it seems to copy the special acts of Jesus.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslims. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. This does not match with other things I have learned about how Muhammad gained power. I wonder if Muslims today know the full story of their religion's beginning.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christians will slowly remove added ideas until only Jesus' original teaching about God remains.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different Christian groups with different ideas, more people will share the same beliefs.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome first tried to destroy Christians, but later became Christian itself. America moved from having slaves to having African-American leaders. The coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for Jesus' original message, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just their simple meaning.\n\nLooking back in history, we find Judaism came before Christianity. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in many ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from tall chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about the people or animals their factories harm. They ignore the dirty smoke from their buildings and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They will do anything to save or make more money. Workers might lose their jobs without warning, and the companies do not help them find new work. During this time, there were few laws to protect workers. This meant owners could make people work long hours in dangerous places. The workers had to accept these bad conditions both at work and in their homes. There was no one to help them or give them information about their rights.\n\nWhile there were some worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the poor workers instead of helping them. The workers could not escape their hard lives. Many of them came from other countries and were very poor. They had to depend on cruel business owners who treated them like slaves. In these terrible conditions, people often became hopeless and desperate.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his better works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. While the word appeared in very old writing, Poe likely got it from more recent German writing.\n\nPoe read many German writers. One of these writers was named Goethe, who wrote a famous story called \"Faust.\" Inside \"Faust\" was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king becomes very sad, drinks too much, and finally walks to a high place where he throws the cup into the sea and dies.\n\nThe king in Goethe's poem and the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very much alike. Both are very sad and alone. This might show how Poe felt about his own problems with drinking. Poe used the word \"Thule\" in another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" around the same time.\n\nWhen we read \"Dream-Land,\" we see a dark, lonely place where the speaker sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad world of the King of Thule. It seems Poe may have been writing about the same kind of feelings that Goethe wrote about in his poem.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing because Goethe was very famous at that time. Many people were making new versions of Goethe's works, so Poe would have had many chances to read them. Also, other writers Poe respected, like Tennyson, spoke highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Can a store be forced to pay extra money as punishment in California if a customer gets hurt from falling on spilled food when the store manager knew about the danger but did nothing?\n\nHere are the important facts: A woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back badly. The fall happened because there was applesauce on the floor. Two workers had told the store manager about the spilled applesauce earlier. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. Five other people had fallen in the same store that year.\n\nThe law in California says stores must pay extra money as punishment if they do very bad things that hurt people. The store must know that what they are doing could hurt someone, and they must choose not to fix the problem anyway.\n\nIn this case, the manager knew about the spill for thirty minutes before Ms. Palmer fell. He also knew that other people had fallen in his store before. He still chose not to clean up the spill or ask someone else to do it. Because he knew about the danger but did nothing, a judge will probably let Ms. Palmer ask for extra money as punishment.\n\nThe store might have to pay both for Ms. Palmer's medical care and extra money to teach them to be more careful in the future. This is because the manager's choice to ignore the spill was very wrong, especially since he knew it could hurt someone.",
            "She always felt she needed something. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live, always wondering about her feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely fought with each other or with her. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. Her parents were calm, but she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not quiet. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" Her mother was on the floor, clearly hurting. She kept saying \"ow\" over and over. The daughter went to her mother to help. \"Please... take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me how to lift you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove away.\n\nThe hospital always smells clean but scary. The daughter did not notice this because she could only think about her mother. She carried her mother in quickly and called for help. doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away to check her. The daughter had to wait and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen while trying to reach something high up in the kitchen.",
            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The diet includes lots of plants, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. It limits foods from animals. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood test results in heavy people.\n\nThe researchers watched 74,886 women for 20 years. These women were nurses between 38 and 63 years old. When the study began, none had heart problems or diabetes. Six times during the study, the women told researchers what they ate by filling out food forms. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death records to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and medicine use.\n\nTo understand eating patterns better, they averaged what each woman ate over time. They also considered other things that could affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nAfter studying the numbers carefully, they found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems. During the 20 years, 2,391 women had heart attacks, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 29% less chance of having heart problems compared to those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma. \n\nBurma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Asia. Since 1962, military leaders have controlled the country with force. In 2007, people went into the streets to protest against the government. Many of these protesters were Buddhist religious men wearing orange clothes. People called these protests the \"Orange Movement\" because of the clothes these men wore.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. Then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news writers from other countries from doing their work. They killed a news photographer from Japan who was taking pictures of the protests. The government said thirteen people died. However, a military officer who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nSadly, this kind of violence has happened many times in history. Governments often try to stop people who speak against them. This happened in China in 1989, when students and workers gathered in a place called Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people died there. In the 1990s, one group in Rwanda killed many people from another group. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible events show us how some leaders will do anything to keep power. They remind us why we must speak up when we see wrong things happening in the world.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and helped create a special sound in jazz music. While he played the piano, his real skill was in writing music that made each person in his band sound their best.\n\nEllington knew how to write music that let players make their own special sounds. He also knew how to make all the different instruments work together to create beautiful music. He understood what each player could do best, and he used this knowledge to write some of the most important jazz music ever made.\n\nThe Grove Music book talks about how Ellington used the human voice in new ways. In his song \"Creole Love Call,\" he used the voice like another instrument in the band, without any words. This was something new at the time. The song shows how well he could write for different players. It is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: Voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: Quiet trumpet plays alone\nPart 3: High clarinet plays with soft piano\nPart 4: Full band plays together\nPart 5: Wind instruments lead, with other instruments adding beat\nPart 6: Voice and winds play together again, with voice making special sounds\n\nThe song ends with a voice run and an unusual sound from the trombone.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington continued to use voices and instruments in special ways. He had singers make sounds like instruments, and he had instruments make sounds like voices. This helped create the special sound that made his music famous.",
            "How do living things change over time? What guides these changes? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these animals grow their shells and how the shells have changed over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells. We put the numbers we found into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how living Prunum grow to better understand how these animals have changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. Each circle is called a whorl. The whorls wrap around the middle of the shell, which is called the columella. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Then count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that follow a path through space. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can show this path with pictures and math. Once we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough in keeping mothers and children healthy. There are many reasons for this, which suggest the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional birth helpers who cannot help if there are serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nSpecial operations to help difficult births (called c-sections) are not common enough - only 4 out of 100 births. In cities, 7 out of 100 births are c-sections, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nTo make things better, Indonesia must decide how to provide more health services. They can either make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they can make the whole health system stronger. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after heavy metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of heavy metal music, and this continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of heavy metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand today's heavy metal music, we must understand how it grew and changed.\n\nHeavy metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more dramatic shows. Heavy metal musicians must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy metal was different from other popular music because it showed the dark side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first heavy metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and a wild sound that went up and down, like the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album to prove they could make powerful music.",
            "Many years before artists started making strange dream pictures, Henri Rousseau was already painting his own dreams. His 1910 painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted in life. From the start, he hoped other artists would accept and praise his work, but this was not easy to achieve. \"The Dream\" shows how Rousseau had to choose between two paths: either paint like others to be accepted, or follow his own special way of making art.\n\nTo understand this painting better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father fixed metal items and sold hardware, making enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the city collecting money from people at gates until he was forty years old. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His life was very sad at times. His first wife died, and before that, eight of their babies died. Only one child lived, a daughter named Julia. To feel better, he started painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting late in life and had no training. He worked at the same time as many famous artists like Matisse. While Matisse tried very hard not to paint like everyone else, Rousseau actually wanted to paint pictures that looked like what others were doing, so the art world would accept him.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or through what happens to us. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study what makes things right or beautiful, we try to explain why we feel the way we do. We do not make rules about how to create beautiful things or how to be good.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we cannot fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss why the Mona Lisa is a great painting, they might talk about colors or shapes. But these words do not really tell us why it is special. Often, when someone talks about art they love, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have something special that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that stories tell us things that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. The same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI believe art and right actions are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way we cannot fully explain. This is especially true with stories and books. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life. They help us think about what is right and wrong, just as we must do in our own lives.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's special way of life comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. The Roman writer Tacitus said it came from a group called the Tungrians. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars. He learned this name from people called the Gauls. Some think the name comes from the word for \"spear,\" while others say it means \"to shout\" in an old language.\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the German people were different from others. He thought they had always lived in their land and did not come from somewhere else. He asked why anyone would want to leave warm places like Asia or Africa to live in the cold, wild German lands.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania, but they did trade with the German people. Sometimes Roman armies would go into Germania to get goods or fight. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and found in their land. Many German men also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, we see how hiding one's true self can help someone for a time, but can also cause problems. The story shows that people must eventually return to their real selves, or they might lose who they truly are. When someone stops hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind finding out they were fooled, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the story, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and must hide her women's clothes.\n\nViola arrives in a strange place and thinks she must act like a man to protect herself. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must deal with her own feelings for Orsino, who thinks she is a man.\n\nToday's readers might see the play differently. It shows how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings into the open. This is true for both Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have deeper, hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare likely wanted to make fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (who she knows as Cesario) to Sebastian. After this, she starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "German control of its colonies was often cruel, especially in South West Africa where many local people were killed. However, the way Germans ruled their colonies was different in each place. This was also true for schools. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other writers also said good things about German schools in places like Kamerun.\n\nThe story was very different in South West Africa, which is now called Namibia. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left this work to church groups and gave them little help. The government did spend money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write. This happened because of many different reasons in society, government, and business.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most of these books were written in German during the early 1900s when Germany still controlled these places. These early books just told what the schools were like. Later, books in English looked at how schools were different in each colony. One important writer named Cohen studied schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa made its schools very different from other colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, even though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and the Southwest area.\n\nThe two countries had many differences. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. They also fought over land and other important things. This kind of problem is common between countries that share a border.\n\nThe United States has had difficult relationships with few countries in Latin America. Mexico and Cuba are the main examples because they are very close to the United States. Other Latin American countries have usually been friendly with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like the Catholic religion that was common in Mexico. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about problems at the border. Bad people would cross the border to cause trouble in both countries. This continued until both countries put soldiers at the border to stop it.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the late 1800s, the United States was no longer trying to take Mexican land. Instead, American businesses wanted to work in Mexico. This helped make the two countries more friendly.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I did not know about. This made me unable to work or do many normal things.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of getting help money from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry much. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can promise anything, and sometimes problems are too big to fix alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing. The people who went west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready for problems. I have emergency supplies: medical things, water cleaning tablets, and window covers. I have lights, batteries, matches, and stored food. If you can grow food or have a wood stove, that is good.\n\nBut most important: know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as the Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. In Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people hold a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and common people join this event. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its basic ideas over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside forces,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhists themselves. \"Outside forces\" come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither help nor hurt Buddhism on purpose - we call these \"neutral,\" though they might still affect the religion.\n\nThe main ideas of Buddhism are important to understand. Buddhists believe in three special things: the Buddha (their teacher), the Dhamma (their holy books), and the Sangha (their religious community). Their holy books are split into three parts. One part has Buddha's teachings, another has rules for living, and the third part talks about deep ideas about life.\n\nThese deep ideas include beliefs that there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Buddhists believe people are born again and again until they understand these truths. When someone fully understands, they stop wanting things too much, stop hating, and stop being confused about life.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in relationships, and do not use drugs or alcohol. Religious teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is that life includes suffering, that wanting things causes suffering, and that people can learn to end their suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the Bible, it is written that only a foolish person says there is no God. Two important religious thinkers, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, wrote about why they believe God exists. Both men tried to prove that the God of the Bible is real. To compare their ideas fairly, we must look at how each man explained his belief in the same God. While both made good points, neither gave a complete reason for believing in God.\n\nLet us first look at what Anselm said. He believed that understanding God comes through faith. He said that because we can think about God in our minds, God must be real. He thought we could find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. Anselm said we do not need outside proof to know God exists. We only need to think about what we already know in our hearts. This way of believing without seeing clear proof is called faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas had different ideas. He said we can prove God exists by using careful thinking and looking at the world around us. He thought we do not need faith to believe in God. This would help spread Christianity because people would not have to believe without proof. They could understand God through clear thinking alone. Aquinas gave five different reasons to show why God must exist. These reasons were about change, causes, why things exist, levels of goodness, and the order in nature. He showed that we can know God exists by seeing how the world works. It is like having a puzzle with one piece missing - you can know what the missing piece looks like by seeing the empty space and the pieces around it.",
            "Writers often try to make readers feel certain ways about important things in their stories. F. Scott Fitzgerald does this in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses special ways of writing to create these feelings. One way he does this is by using colors to mean special things.\n\nIn the book, Fitzgerald makes colors like white, gray, red, and pink have special meanings. When he uses these colors later, readers remember the feelings they are supposed to have. This is very clear with how he uses white and gray colors.\n\nWhite and gray in the book often show things that are all the same, with white meaning rich and clean, while gray means old and tired. We see this from the start. The two women, Daisy and Jordan, always wear white clothes. In fact, many people wear white: Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom has on a white shirt when he sees Myrtle, and Catherine's face is white with powder.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to show regular, common things. Nick goes to work through the white streets of New York. The names of people at Gatsby's parties become gray words in Nick's notes. Many plain buildings and people are described as white or gray. In the poor area called the Valley of Ashes, everything is gray - the cars, the land, and even the people.\n\nAfter making readers understand what these colors mean, Fitzgerald uses them to tell us something about Daisy. When she appears in white clothes and drives a white car, we start to see her differently. She becomes less special and more like everything else - just something Gatsby wants to have. This helps readers understand that maybe Daisy is not as special as Gatsby thinks she is.",
            "San Diego County grows many foods because the weather is warm and sunny. Farmers grow tomatoes, oranges, green vegetables, and many other foods. They also get honey from bees and milk from cows. Many people want to buy food grown without chemicals, and they often must wait to get it. Some farms let people visit to see how food grows. People can also walk on these farms to see birds and enjoy nature.\n\nThese farms can get help from the government while making the land better for wild animals. They can also make money by teaching people about farming. When farmers grow food without chemicals, more kinds of plants and animals can live on the farm. But farming without chemicals is harder work. Farmers must pull out bad plants by hand and find natural ways to stop insects from eating the food. They also need to feed the soil naturally. Small farms often lose more food to problems than big farms do. Making the land good for wild animals takes more work too. Farmers must plant special plants and move their animals around the land carefully. Because this work is hard, farmers often need help with money and knowledge.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of wild land next to a big forest. Many special animals live in this area. Some of these animals are in danger of dying out, like certain rats, frogs, butterflies, and birds. \n\nNative American people lived on this land for many years. Later, in the late 1800s, people came to raise cows and cut wood. Someone got this land from the government long ago and probably used it for cows or wood since then.\n\nI found this land for sale and looked up ways the government could help a small farmer. I also found another farm nearby that grows food without chemicals to use as an example.",
            "Brothers share a special connection that cannot be broken. This connection brings many feelings like love, pride, anger, and sometimes even mean thoughts. Brothers know each other better than anyone else can. When they look at each other, it is like looking in a mirror. When times are very hard, this connection shows its true nature, whether good or bad. These feelings can lead to serious results.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show us what this means. The older brother tells the story about his younger brother, Doodle. The story takes place in a beautiful green area where the two boys try to do something that cannot succeed. The older brother feels both very proud and very sad at different times, and in the end, only one brother lives.\n\nThe older brother's actions come from his pride. When Doodle was born, the older brother wanted someone to play with and teach things to. He wanted a brother who could run, jump, and climb trees with him. He wanted someone to race with to the water and sit with him high in the pine tree behind their family's barn. But Doodle was born very sick, with a weak heart. The doctors said he might die, and if he lived, he would never be able to run or play hard games.\n\nThis made the older brother very sad and angry. He was so upset that he even thought about hurting baby Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him one day, the older brother's anger went away. This small act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he truly loved his little brother, even if he sometimes did not act like it.",
            "The human brain is an amazing system that processes information in complex ways. Over time, as humans developed new tools, they found new ways to describe how the brain works. People first thought it was like a writing tablet, then like paper, then like a book, and now like a computer. But we must remember that these simple comparisons can sometimes lead us to wrong ideas about the brain.\n\nThe brain first gets information from our senses. These senses change things we feel, hear, and see into signals the brain can use. The brain then changes these signals in different ways. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, your brain first sees simple things like color and shape. Then, your brain uses what it already knows to help you understand that you are seeing a box more quickly.\n\nThe brain also decides what information is important. While your brain sees everything around you, it helps you pay attention only to what matters. For instance, you might not notice every small thing on the ground when you walk, but you might hear someone say your name even in a loud room.\n\nThe brain must store information to use it. There are different kinds of memory. Some memories last only seconds, while others can last for years. When you learn something new, your brain first changes it into a form it can save. For words, your brain might remember how they look, sound, or what they mean. Short-term memories may stay active through signals moving between brain cells. Long-term memories are kept through changes in special proteins.\n\nScientists have different ideas about how the brain organizes what we know. One idea suggests that the brain connects related things together, like linking the word \"chair\" to \"table\" because they are both furniture. These connections help us remember and understand things better.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a serious money problem. Many people lost their jobs. House prices fell sharply. Many big companies failed. These problems continue today, so we must ask: why did this happen, and how can we prevent it?\n\nThe crisis began because banks gave home loans to people who could not pay them back. The government helped two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to buy these bad loans from banks. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money. This affected the whole country's money system.\n\nThe story starts in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president. He wanted to win more support from voters. His government made it easier for banks to give loans. In 1999, a New York Times writer named Steven Holmes wrote about Fannie Mae. He said the government was pushing the company to give more loans to people with low and middle incomes. Holmes warned this could cause problems if the economy became weak.\n\nSeveral things made the problem worse. Banks created new types of home loans that were hard to understand. They also sold these loans to other companies. This meant that when house prices fell, it hurt many parts of the economy, not just the housing market.\n\nWhen house prices finally fell, many banks that had bought these loans lost a lot of money. The five biggest U.S. investment banks owed $4.1 trillion in 2007. Two of these banks were sold for very low prices. One bank closed completely. The other two had to change how they operated. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owed $5 trillion and needed government help to survive.",
            "Let's talk about telling stories. Writers often want to give too much information at once. This can make readers stop reading or feel tired. Even experienced writers sometimes make this mistake.\n\nIt is not good to give too much information all at once.\n\nMost writers know they should show things instead of just telling them. But sometimes we still write long parts where nothing happens, or we try to tell too many things at the same time. We might think we need to explain everything about the past before we can tell the real story. Or we might want to tell every small thing about each person in the story. Both are wrong.\n\nTelling too much means explaining things in simple words instead of showing them happen. In movies, this happens when one person tells another person too many facts at once. In books, the writer does this directly to the readers.\n\nHere is an example. Think about a story where a woman meets a man, they get married, and then he dies. This should not be told quickly in just two pages with only a few words from each person. Instead, the writer should show how the man acts and talks to prove his love. The writer should show how the woman's life becomes better because of him. This helps readers care about both people. When the man dies, readers will feel sad with the woman. They will understand her better.\n\nIn other words, a simple story needs more details to make it complete.\n\nAs a writer, you must add these details carefully. Sometimes you want to hurry and tell everything about a new person in the story. You might want to say they were in the Air Force, now work at night at a gas station, were married two times, have no children, like to fish, want to own the gas station, and what they ate that morning. But this is not the best way to tell a story.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had hurt his wife with a knife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture from the police. The story was short because it was still happening. They only said he had attacked his wife several times and the police had caught him. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, who was 18 years old. Someone shot him in the Sharon Woods area, and he was badly hurt. The police had not caught anyone yet. Special police teams were looking into what happened. The story seemed very short. I think this might have been because Travis was a black man in a black area. I have seen for many years that when bad things happen to people who are not white, the news does not talk about it much. When something bad happens to white people, the news talks about it a lot more.\n\nThey then talked about a bullet hole found in a medical flying machine. They said it was from a small gun. People who help catch criminals are offering money to anyone who can help find who did this.\n\nThe weather news was next. They said it would rain later, and it would not be too hot. They kept this part short so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also told about someone taking money from a store on Clime Road. They spent a lot of time saying the person who did it was a black man wearing a shirt with a hood. I thought they talked too much about his skin color.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez who sold bad things from Texas to Ohio. They said he would be in prison for 300 months instead of saying 25 years. They also said he was Hispanic, which did not seem important to the story.",
            "Let me explain what an ETF is and how it works. An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a special kind of investment that follows the value of many different companies or things, like gold. You can buy and sell it easily, just like a company's stock.\n\nWhen you buy an ETF, you are really buying small parts of many different companies at once. This helps make your investment safer because you are not putting all your money in just one company. ETFs usually cost less money to own than other similar investments.\n\nThere are some things to think about before buying ETFs. You must pay a small fee each time you buy or sell them. However, there are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIn this study, we looked at an ETF called IHF to see if it was better to buy the ETF or to buy shares of the ten biggest companies in it separately. The ten biggest companies make up about 64% of the ETF's total value.\n\nWhen we looked at the numbers, we found something interesting. If you bought shares of just these ten companies in the same amounts as they are in the ETF, you could make about 16% more money than by buying the ETF itself. The investment would also be less risky.\n\nTo make sure these findings were real and not just by chance, we needed to look at how much the prices of these investments moved up and down over time. We did this by studying the standard deviation of both the ETF and the ten companies.",
            "Looking at the numbers shown in Figure 17, we saw that far fewer people sent in their travel records during the third month. This was disappointing, and we were not sure why it happened. When winter comes to our school in the northeast United States, fewer people ride bikes or walk to work. This could explain part of the drop. December is also when the school term ends, and everyone is busy finishing work and giving grades. People may have simply forgotten to write down how they traveled. Also, December brings holidays and a long break when many students and teachers do not come to school at all. School starts again in late January, which may explain why that month's numbers were low. But this does not tell us why February's numbers were so low. Perhaps any project like this starts with great interest that naturally falls over time. To fight this drop, we created a special week in March to get people excited about sharing rides. This helped increase the number of records sent in that month. One of our biggest problems was keeping people interested, especially during school breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother problem we faced is that people like driving their own cars. They enjoy being free to go where they want, when they want. This is a big part of life in our country. So, we needed to give people good reasons to try other ways of getting to school. We gave out many prizes like food tickets for local eating places, coffee shops, and stores. We also gave tickets for back rubs and books. It would have been interesting to see what would happen if we had given bigger prizes, like a new bike or a special car that uses less gas. This might have helped keep people interested. Our prizes stayed the same all through the project. If we had made the prizes better as time went on, more people might have stayed with the project. The small prizes worked well at first, but telling people they could win a bike in December or a special car in January might have kept more people sending in their travel records.",
            "I studied some old films at the Library of Congress. These were special films made by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. There were fifteen films that used special tricks to fool the eye. These tricks were made by careful cutting and joining of film parts.\n\nMost of these films were very simple. They were shot in one room with the camera staying in one place, like watching a stage show. The camera did not move around. It showed the whole scene from far away or middle distance. Each film was usually just one scene.\n\nAt the start of the 1900s, a few films began to do things differently. Some used more than one scene put together. But most trick films were like watching a theater show from your seat. The actors moved from left to right across the screen, like they would on a stage. They did not walk toward or away from the camera.\n\nIn one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), we can see this clearly. The actors come in from the right side and move back and forth. When they leave the picture, the camera stays still.\n\nThese films were always shot from far away or middle distance. They never showed close pictures of faces or things. This was like sitting in a theater, where you see everything happening on the stage at once. The actors stayed away from the camera, so there were no close views.\n\nMost of these early trick films were very short, usually less than one minute. They showed simple magic tricks, like making people appear and disappear. They did not tell long stories. Even though these films looked like one continuous scene to people watching, they were actually made of several pieces of film joined together. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), if you look carefully, you can see where they cut the film to make it look like her head was cut off.",
            "The Gothic Novel is both old and new at the same time. Some people have said these books are too simple, while others praise them for creating feelings of fear and wonder. The first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed old story-telling methods with new ways of writing to create something different. \n\nGothic stories use many ideas from the middle ages, including old buildings and customs. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first written, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things from the past. Many people thought gothic things were old-fashioned compared to new ideas. But the Gothic Novel was special because it mixed old dramatic stories with new ways of showing how characters think and feel. This is why Gothic stories are still interesting to readers today.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic novels is the code of honor called chivalry. This idea comes from the middle ages, when knights had to follow strict rules about being brave and good. Writers like Walpole used these old ideas because they thought their own time needed more honor and goodness. When Walpole wrote his book, his country was having political problems. He may have thought that people in his time were not as good or moral as people in the past.\n\nWe can see this in his book through characters like Frederic. Before we meet him, we learn that he is a prince who has faced many hard times. He shows the qualities of an honorable knight, though Walpole makes these qualities very strong to make a point about what society was missing.",
            "Moving goods from start to finish is called supply chain management. This process begins when a customer orders something and ends when they receive it. Keith Oliver, who helped businesses work better, first used this term in 1982. He explained how to plan and control the movement of goods to make customers happy quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts in moving goods: making things, getting materials, keeping goods ready, choosing where to work, moving goods around, and sharing information. Business leaders use these six parts to serve customers well.\n\nMaking things is the first and most important part. Leaders must know what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They look at what people want to buy in stores. This helps them decide what customers need. Then they pick the best places to make these things, thinking about how many they can make and how good they will be.\n\nAfter choosing where to make things, leaders plan when workers will work and how to keep machines running well. Every small part of making things must be planned carefully. If not, it can waste time and money. For example, stores like Walmart and Target have clear plans for everything. They even have rules about what workers should wear and how trucks should bring goods to stores.\n\nThe second main part is getting materials. Leaders must decide what each workplace can do best. Sometimes, one thing is made in many different places. Each place has different machines, workers, and special skills. Leaders choose which place should do each part of the work. Sometimes, they ask other companies to help make things. They do this to work faster and keep costs low while still making good things.",
            "Books from the time of Queen Victoria often told stories about rich people and included many small details. Two books from this time, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" were different. These stories used mystery and strange events to help readers better understand the people in the stories and why they acted as they did.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" we see this through Oliver's dreams and times when he is not fully awake. In one part of the story, Oliver is shot and hurt. While he is trying to find help, his mind mixes what is real with what is not real. He thinks he hears two bad men, Sikes and Crackit, talking. He hears guns being fired and people shouting. Lights flash before his eyes. Someone pulls him away, but he does not know who. Through all of this, he feels pain that will not stop.\n\nThis part of the story shows us how little control Oliver has over his life. He cannot even try to help himself when he is in danger. It seems that the bad man Fagin has started to break Oliver's spirit. In normal times, anyone would try to save their own life, but Oliver does not even try.\n\nTime itself seems strange to Oliver. The day passes quickly, as if there is no day at all. The night feels both very long because it is so quiet, and very short because the hours move fast.",
            "Two years ago, I helped young students after school with their studies. I was good at teaching English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a young boy named Adrian. He was about nine years old and had trouble reading. I noticed something strange about how he read. He could say some letters well, but others gave him much trouble. Adrian spoke English very well, and I knew he came from a Latin American family.\n\nOne day, I met Adrian's mother when I was watching some students. She could not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we could talk. Then I understood the problem: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English letters well. I hope he reads better now.\n\nI tell this story to show how language problems affect our schools, especially in California. Sometimes these problems are hard to see. Even when children speak English well, reading can be very hard. We know this problem exists, so what should we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: he needed help learning English letters and their sounds. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. We need many ways to help. Teaching in two languages, putting students in English-speaking classes, having special teachers, and English learning classes are all good ideas. But we need to use all of these ways together.\n\nTeaching in two languages is very good for all students, not just Spanish-speaking ones. Studies show that children who learn in two languages do better in school than others. Some people think this is a waste, but they are wrong. If we used this way of teaching in all classes, every student would learn better. We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. That would be too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak both languages.",
            "Many people learn from a young age that there is something greater than themselves in the world. Some learn about this at church, while others go to different places of worship, or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs their parents teach them. Others completely reject these ideas, believing only in what they can see and know. People may follow one set of beliefs, then change to follow another. Whatever way we choose, we all try to understand life's big questions in our own way. We look for something to help guide us through dark times.\n\n\"A red bird,\" my father told me when I asked which bird he liked best. We sat on our front porch, hearing rain hit the metal roof as we smoked. Water poured from the roof's edge, falling on the plants below. He looked out at the rain, seeming both thoughtful and far away. He had become much thinner, and his clothes were too big now. His hair was thinner too. He kept looking at the rain, not at me. I felt very alone and scared. I could not tell him how much I would miss him because talking about it would make everything feel too real. I gave him a hug, then moved my chair closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall in the growing dark.\n\nMy father died that December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. The doctors tried to help him with strong medicine, but it only made him live longer in pain. I could not understand why. I asked myself why this would happen if there was a God. At night, I stopped praying. I thought that if God was real, he no longer heard me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father better than anyone, and I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear news.\n\nNo one called to tell me when he died.",
            "John Taylor was an early supporter of the Republican way of thinking in America. He was mainly a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in government, made him known for speaking strongly about personal freedom and government power. His love of farming shaped most of his ideas about how government should work. He tried to protect and support farming, which he thought was the best job, and this affected his views on state power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to make a perfect system. This was because the new country did not have old rules that would get in the way of making a government run by the people. He believed strongly that people have natural rights, and that these rights work together. If you take away one right, you harm all the others. He said the government should not be able to touch these rights. In nature, he said, strong and clever but bad people would win, but in a proper society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this good society, Taylor thought we needed a government that understands both the good and bad in people. He was very clear about right and wrong. He said that since people run government, government shows both good and bad human qualities. He thought good rules were those that protect what people own, help farming grow, and stop big business from having too much power. He believed that even if bad people ran the government, good rules would make it work fairly. Taylor thought people always act for their own good, but this only becomes bad when people take from others instead of helping everyone.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted people to follow the Constitution exactly as written. He wanted a small federal government that could only do what the Constitution clearly said it could do. He knew that a big federal government would cost too much money and might become too powerful. But he also thought that just reading the Constitution's words was not enough - people needed to understand what the writers meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important than the Constitution because it showed that the states should be free to rule themselves.",
            "I looked down at what was in front of me. My mind saw everything but felt nothing. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I wasn't really thinking, just seeing.\n\nOnce, an artist told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was young. The book teaches many things about art. One lesson is to put a frame around what you want to draw. This makes a complex picture simpler. For example, a bowl of fruit in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, looking down at the bowl, I couldn't think about art frames. I could only stand and look. Famous artists like Picasso used blue colors, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists used many colors. If I were an artist, this would be my brown picture, my brown story.\n\nMy fingers touched the tool I needed. My hand moved through the air as my mind told it what to do. The water moved smoothly and clearly. Small pieces broke away and disappeared. Moving more quickly the second time, my hand pushed the toilet handle again. The brown mess stayed at the bottom of the toilet, not moving.\n\nI stood there holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt tight around my neck. I was not happy about what someone had left in the bathroom at the store where I worked. After trying to flush several times, I pulled some toilet paper from the wall.

            "Young people are dying while driving cars. Several things make driving dangerous for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health says that young people's brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Not having enough practice is also a big problem. This lack of experience leads to more deadly crashes, cars turning over, driving too fast, and going off the road.\n\nYoung drivers have more problems when they drive with friends their age, which they often do. A study by researchers in Southern California showed that having young passengers in the car makes crashes more likely.\n\nSome states try to make young drivers safer by giving them special licenses. These licenses say when they can drive and do not let them carry other young people in their cars.\n\nBut these special licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that the youngest drivers cannot handle the dangers of driving safely. One expert who studies how people think believes even age 18 is too young to drive. He found that people under age 20 often do dangerous things just for fun. It makes sense to wait until people are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we keep giving driver's licenses to young people, more will die on the roads. In the coming years, many more young people will be old enough to drive, which could make the problem worse.\n\nThere is a simple way to fix this. Schools could still teach driving, but no one under 18 could drive a car. New drivers would still need to practice with an adult and learn the rules. Because young drivers have problems in all states, one law for the whole country would help keep young people safe everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new, but it could save many lives.",
            "This paper looks at three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it explains what the disorder is. Then, it shows how doctors find it in patients. Finally, it tells how teachers can help students with CAPD in regular classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a brain problem that makes it hard for people to understand what they hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds normally. However, their brains cannot process these sounds correctly. For example, they may have trouble understanding words when there is other noise nearby, or they may find it hard to tell where sounds are coming from.\n\nDoctors first noticed this problem in the 1950s. They saw it in children who had trouble talking and understanding others. Since then, many doctors have studied CAPD and created tests to find it in patients.\n\nPeople with CAPD may have several problems. They might not know where sounds come from. They might find it hard to tell different sounds apart. They might not understand changes in how people speak, like when someone is joking. They might also have trouble remembering the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors watch how the person listens and responds to different sounds. They may ask questions about how well the person understands speech in different situations. They might also give special listening tests. There is no single test that can show for sure if someone has CAPD. Also, doctors do not know what causes this problem. The tests often involve asking people to listen to different words or numbers at the same time and then repeat what they heard.",
            "I want to study to become a social worker. My goal is to work for the government helping children who have been hurt by their families. I want to help families who are having problems. I believe I can bring important things to this work: helping others, showing respect, doing what is right, and always learning to do better at my job. These things are important not just for work, but also to me as a person.\n\nI have always wanted to help people, but I was not sure what kind of work to do. In school, I saw many young people run away from their problems. Some dealt with their troubles in ways that were not good. This made me want to study how people think and act. After finishing school in 2009, I took some time to think about my future. \n\nThat summer, I met a young boy at my friend's house. He was there because his parents were hurting him. The next day, he called the police about his parents. I went to help and told the police about my education in studying how people think. They asked me to talk to the parents because they could not do anything to help the boy. The parents seemed worried and said their son was just causing trouble. After this, I knew I wanted to be a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also believe everyone should be treated fairly. Our society says each person is important, but often pushes people to be the same as others. I do not like being told I must be like everyone else. In school, I showed this by looking different from others and standing up for people who were treated badly because they were different. I joined groups that helped people who were treated unfairly.

The other way looks at how where we live, our culture, and our money affect our sleep.\n\nSleep problems can be grouped in different ways. Some start on their own, while others happen because of mental health issues or other health problems. The most common sleep problem is when people cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. This is called insomnia. Some people have the opposite problem - they sleep too much. Others might walk in their sleep or have bad dreams.\n\nScientists found that special cells in the brain help control when we are awake or asleep. They did tests with mice to learn how these brain cells work. They found that certain parts of brain cells, called receptors, are very important for sleep. When these receptors work well, animals can sleep normally. When they do not work well, sleep becomes hard.\n\nThis information helps us understand why some people have trouble sleeping. If someone's parents had sleep problems, they might get the same problems. This can make life hard because people need good sleep to do well at school or work. When people cannot sleep well, it affects many parts of their daily life.",
            "I have been a student at this university for more than two years now. Moving around our large school area is often hard for many students, including me. When I first came here, I lived in a room far on the east side of school. Walking from my room to my classes near the middle of school could take 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. \n\nAn older student told me that years ago, the east living areas were far from other buildings, with much empty land between them. Now that empty space has new sports fields and big buildings. As our school grows bigger, it becomes harder to get from place to place. The best answer to this problem is the bicycle. However, just having bicycles is not enough. Students need to use them, and the school needs to make it easier for bicycle riders.\n\nI talked to a friend who just started riding his bicycle again after stopping for many years. He said he did not know why he ever stopped. \"Bicycles are wonderful,\" he said. \"For some time, people thought bicycles were not good to use, but they are the best way to move around.\" Riding a bicycle is good for your health and uses very little energy. A simple meal can give you enough power to ride very far.\n\nI now live away from the school area, but my home is as far from classes as some school rooms are. Getting a bicycle was the best thing I did this year. Every day, I have class in a building that would take 25 minutes to reach by walking. On my bicycle, I can get there in 5 minutes if I ride fast. The only problem is that the most direct road is often hard to use, whether walking or riding. \n\nWalking is fine, but I do not have enough time. Without my bicycle, I would have to walk everywhere. Walking to just one of my classes would take 40 more minutes each day. That means more than two hours every week just for one class. When you think about going to other classes and meetings, it takes too much time.",
            "In his book \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and business control. He creates a future world where people are taught to value the group more than themselves. They learn from birth to only care about being happy right now.\n\nThe people in this world are like pieces in a game, controlled by powerful leaders. They can only think in ways that these leaders allow. Huxley shows how big businesses and their systems can harm society. The story points out problems he saw growing in the economy of his time.\n\nIn the book, regular people do not understand how money and power really work. They only think about what they can get for themselves. The lower classes in the story, called Delta and Gamma, cannot think freely. While they sleep, they hear messages that make them want to buy things and spend money. The top leader uses this to control them. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and they believe in a system that keeps them down. Even most of the upper classes, called Alpha and Beta, accept things as they are.\n\nPeople in this future world do not form real friendships or relationships. Even the main characters seem empty, without much personality. This might show how Huxley thought technology and business control could take away people's ability to think and feel freely. There is no love in this world. Men only talk about how women look, and women speak without shame about their physical relationships. Each group accepts their place in society without question. They obey and keep buying things, believing this makes them better, just as their leaders want them to think.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at my local college. In class, we often talked about whether Islam was a religion that promoted peace or conflict. This question seems even more important today. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, I have seen how news reports about Islam have changed. At first, many news stories were negative. Now, they show much more acceptance of Islam in America. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad interests me because what I read seems different from what I learned before. I used to think Muhammad made people join his religion by force when he took control of their lands. However, the book shows him as a good man who was not understood by others. It says people came to him freely when they saw the truth in his words.\n\nI notice that some stories about Muhammad are very similar to stories about Jesus. For example, there is a story where Muhammad made a small amount of food become enough to feed forty men. This reminds me of Jesus feeding many people. I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like a humble teacher who did special things. This bothers me because it seems to copy the special acts of Jesus.\n\nThe book has many stories about people becoming Muslims. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else, who heard it from another person. This makes me doubt if the stories are true.\n\nWhat troubles me most is how the book tries to show Muhammad as a good, quiet, and wise man. This does not match with other things I have learned about how Muhammad gained power. I wonder if Muslims today know the full story of their religion's beginning.",
            "The ideas Jesus taught during his life were quickly changed as Christian thinking grew after his death. Looking at history, we can see Christianity moving further from what Jesus first taught. Today, more people seem to understand this and want change. While some people want to keep old ways of thinking, they may be too few to stop change.\n\nIn the years ahead, Christians will learn more about their history. They will want to know what ideas were added to their religion after Jesus, and what Jesus really meant to teach. This change may take many years, but it will happen. Christians will slowly remove added ideas until only Jesus' original teaching about God remains.\n\nWhen this happens in America and Europe, many people will try to follow only what Jesus taught. Churches will still be important, but they will lead people back to simpler beliefs. Instead of many different Christian groups with different ideas, more people will share the same beliefs.\n\nHistory shows us that big changes can happen. For example, Rome first tried to destroy Christians, but later became Christian itself. America moved from having slaves to having African-American leaders. The coming change in Christianity will be like this. People will look for Jesus' original message, and many different Christian groups will become more alike. To understand Jesus better, people will learn to read his words as having deeper meaning, not just their simple meaning.\n\nLooking back in history, we find Judaism came before Christianity. By the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Jewish people believed in one God, followed their holy books, and thought God had given them their religion. But Jewish people were divided into different groups: the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally wanting things only for themselves. They care about making their own lives better but do not help others who have less. The book shows this in many ways, especially through the factory owners and managers.\n\nThese business leaders only want to make their companies bigger and richer. They do not care who gets hurt as they try to grow. In the book, Upton Sinclair describes how the factory buildings stand dark against the sky, with smoke coming from tall chimneys. This smoke spreads far into the distance. He wants us to see how the factories hurt the air and land around them. The owners do not worry about the people or animals their factories harm. They ignore the dirty smoke from their buildings and the animal waste that runs from the many animal holding areas.\n\nThe owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They will do anything to save or make more money. Workers might lose their jobs without warning, and the companies do not help them find new work. During this time, there were few laws to protect workers. This meant owners could make people work long hours in dangerous places. The workers had to accept these bad conditions both at work and in their homes. There was no one to help them or give them information about their rights.\n\nWhile there were some worker groups called unions, these often took advantage of the poor workers instead of helping them. The workers could not escape their hard lives. Many of them came from other countries and were very poor. They had to depend on cruel business owners who treated them like slaves. In these terrible conditions, people often became hopeless and desperate.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\" which he thought was one of his better works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thule\" two times. This word comes from old stories about a far-away island north of Britain. While the word appeared in very old writing, Poe likely got it from more recent German writing.\n\nPoe read many German writers. One of these writers was named Goethe, who wrote a famous story called \"Faust.\" Inside \"Faust\" was a shorter poem about \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king becomes very sad, drinks too much, and finally walks to a high place where he throws the cup into the sea and dies.\n\nThe king in Goethe's poem and the person in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very much alike. Both are very sad and alone. This might show how Poe felt about his own problems with drinking. Poe used the word \"Thule\" in another story called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" around the same time.\n\nWhen we read \"Dream-Land,\" we see a dark, lonely place where the speaker sees dead friends and a world without bright colors. This is very much like the sad world of the King of Thule. It seems Poe may have been writing about the same kind of feelings that Goethe wrote about in his poem.\n\nPoe knew about Goethe's writing because Goethe was very famous at that time. Many people were making new versions of Goethe's works, so Poe would have had many chances to read them. Also, other writers Poe respected, like Tennyson, spoke highly of Goethe's work.",
            "Can a store be forced to pay extra money as punishment in California if a customer gets hurt from falling on spilled food when the store manager knew about the danger but did nothing?\n\nHere are the important facts: A woman named Jennifer Palmer fell in a grocery store and hurt her back badly. The fall happened because there was applesauce on the floor. Two workers had told the store manager about the spilled applesauce earlier. The manager, Paul Martin, did not clean it up because he was eating his dinner. Five other people had fallen in the same store that year.\n\nThe law in California says stores must pay extra money as punishment if they do very bad things that hurt people. The store must know that what they are doing could hurt someone, and they must choose not to fix the problem anyway.\n\nIn this case, the manager knew about the spill for thirty minutes before Ms. Palmer fell. He also knew that other people had fallen in his store before. He still chose not to clean up the spill or ask someone else to do it. Because he knew about the danger but did nothing, a judge will probably let Ms. Palmer ask for extra money as punishment.\n\nThe store might have to pay both for Ms. Palmer's medical care and extra money to teach them to be more careful in the future. This is because the manager's choice to ignore the spill was very wrong, especially since he knew it could hurt someone.",
            "She always felt she needed something. This feeling would not go away. It began when she was 14, as she entered her teenage years. Now at 17, the feeling remained. She knew she wanted a person, not a thing. Yet no boys interested her. Some boys liked her and tried to get her attention, but she felt nothing for them. She often wondered why she was different from other teenage girls. After thinking about this for years, she had ideas but no clear answers. So she continued to live, always wondering about her feelings.\n\nLife at home was usually quiet. Her parents were good people who lived peacefully. They rarely fought with each other or with her. The only problems came when she tried to show she could make her own choices. Her parents were calm, but she was full of life and fun. People liked her because she was both friendly and kind.\n\nBut this day was not quiet. As she walked through the house looking for something to do, she heard her mother cry out from the kitchen. She ran to the kitchen asking, \"Mom? Mom, what is wrong?\" Her mother was on the floor, clearly hurting. She kept saying \"ow\" over and over. The daughter went to her mother to help. \"Please... take me to the hospital,\" her mother said with difficulty. \"Show me how to lift you,\" the daughter said. She was glad she had learned how to lift heavy things. She carried her mother to the car, put her in the back seat, and drove away.\n\nThe hospital always smells clean but scary. The daughter did not notice this because she could only think about her mother. She carried her mother in quickly and called for help. doctors came quickly. They put her mother on a bed with wheels and took her away to check her. The daughter had to wait and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen while trying to reach something high up in the kitchen.",
            "This study looked at how eating a Mediterranean-style diet affects heart health. The diet includes lots of plants, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. It limits foods from animals. A small amount of wine is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who follow this diet have better heart health and live longer. One study found that this diet works better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and improving blood test results in heavy people.\n\nThe researchers watched 74,886 women for 20 years. These women were nurses between 38 and 63 years old. When the study began, none had heart problems or diabetes. Six times during the study, the women told researchers what they ate by filling out food forms. Almost all the women stayed in the study for the full 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked hospital records and death records to confirm when women had heart attacks or strokes. They also looked at other things that affect health, like exercise, smoking, and medicine use.\n\nTo understand eating patterns better, they averaged what each woman ate over time. They also considered other things that could affect the results, like age and exercise.\n\nAfter studying the numbers carefully, they found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had fewer heart problems. During the 20 years, 2,391 women had heart attacks, 1,763 had strokes, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet best had about 29% less chance of having heart problems compared to those who followed it least.",
            "A young actress stands on a street with a sign. The sign suggests that the spirit of Hitler lives in Burma. \n\nBurma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Asia. Since 1962, military leaders have controlled the country with force. In 2007, people went into the streets to protest against the government. Many of these protesters were Buddhist religious men wearing orange clothes. People called these protests the \"Orange Movement\" because of the clothes these men wore.\n\nAt first, the government let the protests continue peacefully. Then, things became violent. The military attacked religious buildings and hurt many people. They stopped news writers from other countries from doing their work. They killed a news photographer from Japan who was taking pictures of the protests. The government said thirteen people died. However, a military officer who left his job said thousands of people were killed.\n\nSadly, this kind of violence has happened many times in history. Governments often try to stop people who speak against them. This happened in China in 1989, when students and workers gathered in a place called Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people died there. In the 1990s, one group in Rwanda killed many people from another group. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hitler killed millions of Jewish people in Europe.\n\nThese terrible events show us how some leaders will do anything to keep power. They remind us why we must speak up when we see wrong things happening in the world.",
            "Duke Ellington was one of the greatest jazz musicians in history. He led his band for many years and helped create a special sound in jazz music. While he played the piano, his real skill was in writing music that made each person in his band sound their best.\n\nEllington knew how to write music that let players make their own special sounds. He also knew how to make all the different instruments work together to create beautiful music. He understood what each player could do best, and he used this knowledge to write some of the most important jazz music ever made.\n\nThe Grove Music book talks about how Ellington used the human voice in new ways. In his song \"Creole Love Call,\" he used the voice like another instrument in the band, without any words. This was something new at the time. The song shows how well he could write for different players. It is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: Voice and wind instruments play back and forth\nPart 2: Quiet trumpet plays alone\nPart 3: High clarinet plays with soft piano\nPart 4: Full band plays together\nPart 5: Wind instruments lead, with other instruments adding beat\nPart 6: Voice and winds play together again, with voice making special sounds\n\nThe song ends with a voice run and an unusual sound from the trombone.\n\nIn other songs like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" Ellington continued to use voices and instruments in special ways. He had singers make sounds like instruments, and he had instruments make sounds like voices. This helped create the special sound that made his music famous.",
            "How do living things change over time? What guides these changes? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that we could not yet describe living things using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how sea shells grow and change over time. Our study looks at a type of sea animal called Prunum. We want to understand how these animals grow their shells and how the shells have changed over many years.\n\nWe took X-ray pictures of different Prunum shells. We put the numbers we found into a computer program called CerioShell. This helped us see what kinds of shell shapes are possible for Prunum. We also watched how living Prunum grow to better understand how these animals have changed over a very long time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that goes around in a circle many times. Each circle is called a whorl. The whorls wrap around the middle of the shell, which is called the columella. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. All other whorls make up the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line between whorls starts. Draw a line to split the shell in two parts. Then count the whorls from this line. You can count parts of whorls in quarters.\n\nAs the animal builds its shell, it makes new openings that follow a path through space. Scientists can measure this path by looking at the center of each opening and how wide and tall it is.\n\nWe can show this path with pictures and math. Once we understand the math, we can change numbers to see how different shells might grow.",
            "In Indonesia, the number of babies and young children who die has stayed almost the same for the past ten years. The country is doing well in some areas, like providing clean water. However, it is not doing well enough in keeping mothers and children healthy. There are many reasons for this, which suggest the whole health system needs to be made stronger.\n\nMore births now happen with trained health workers present - about 72 out of 100 births. However, many of these workers are traditional birth helpers who cannot help if there are serious problems during birth. This means many mothers still die from losing too much blood. Also, fewer sick children under five years old are being seen by doctors. We also know that not enough mothers get care after having their babies.\n\nSpecial operations to help difficult births (called c-sections) are not common enough - only 4 out of 100 births. In cities, 7 out of 100 births are c-sections, but in rural areas, only 2 out of 100 are. This shows that health care is better in cities than in rural areas. Also, rich people get much more health care than poor people. The difference is very large - 27 out of 100. Poor people often cannot pay for health care.\n\nTo make things better, Indonesia must decide how to provide more health services. They can either make special programs just for mothers and babies, or they can make the whole health system stronger. Special programs might work faster and be easier to manage. But these programs can cause problems. When a lot of money goes to one health program, other important health services get less money and fewer workers. Also, having many different programs doing the same work wastes time and money.",
            "Over the past hundred years, popular music has grown to include many different types. There are now so many kinds of music that it is hard to list them all. Each type of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has created many smaller groups within itself.\n\nHeavy metal rock music has become one of the most interesting types of popular music in the past forty years. It shows many different feelings, usually dark ones. Soon after heavy metal began, musicians found they could change it in many ways. They made new kinds of heavy metal music, and this continues today.\n\nNow there are so many different kinds of heavy metal that it is hard to say exactly what it is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. To understand today's heavy metal music, we must understand how it grew and changed.\n\nHeavy metal is often about dark things. It uses more of everything - more loud sounds, more angry words, and more dramatic shows. Heavy metal musicians must be very good at playing their instruments. In the middle of the 1970s, many musicians used drugs, which led them to make strange music. Heavy metal was different from other popular music because it showed the dark side of life. Some of these dark ideas came from music written hundreds of years ago.\n\nOne of the first heavy metal songs might have been \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. They wrote this song to show they could make music as strong as the Rolling Stones. The song had dark words and a wild sound that went up and down, like the effects of drugs. They put this song on their White Album to prove they could make powerful music.",
            "Many years before artists started making strange dream pictures, Henri Rousseau was already painting his own dreams. His 1910 painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking with wonder at the land she sees in her sleep. The painting also shows what Rousseau himself wanted in life. From the start, he hoped other artists would accept and praise his work, but this was not easy to achieve. \"The Dream\" shows how Rousseau had to choose between two paths: either paint like others to be accepted, or follow his own special way of making art.\n\nTo understand this painting better, we should know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father fixed metal items and sold hardware, making enough money to live well. Rousseau never went to art school. Instead, he worked for the city collecting money from people at gates until he was forty years old. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His life was very sad at times. His first wife died, and before that, eight of their babies died. Only one child lived, a daughter named Julia. To feel better, he started painting.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time who painted fancy pictures of poor people, Rousseau painted more simply, like ordinary people did. He wanted very much to be accepted by other artists. This was hard because he started painting late in life and had no training. He worked at the same time as many famous artists like Matisse. While Matisse tried very hard not to paint like everyone else, Rousseau actually wanted to paint pictures that looked like what others were doing, so the art world would accept him.",
            "Many wise people have seen a close link between what is right and what is beautiful. I believe there is a deep reason for this connection. The poet John Keats wrote that beauty and truth are the same thing, and this is all we need to know.\n\nWe learn most things in life through school or through what happens to us. But we seem to understand right and wrong, and beauty, in a different way. When we study what makes things right or beautiful, we try to explain why we feel the way we do. We do not make rules about how to create beautiful things or how to be good.\n\nWhen we talk about art or right actions, we cannot fully explain why they move us. For example, when people discuss why the Mona Lisa is a great painting, they might talk about colors or shapes. But these words do not really tell us why it is special. Often, when someone talks about art they love, they first say, \"There is just something about it.\" I think both art and right actions have something special that cannot be fully described.\n\nThe writer Flannery O'Connor said that stories tell us things that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how well we describe a story, there is always something more that we cannot explain. The same is true about right and wrong.\n\nI believe art and right actions are closely connected because we feel them deeply in a way we cannot fully explain. This is especially true with stories and books. Stories are important to us because they show us what matters in life. They help us think about what is right and wrong, just as we must do in our own lives.",
            "Germany today is a strong and united nation. Its culture spreads from the mountains in the south to the northern seas. You can feel this same culture as you travel from the western city of Cologne to the eastern city of Dresden. Germany's special way of life comes from many different groups of people who lived there long ago.\n\nThe old name for Germany was Germania. No one knows exactly where this name came from. The Roman writer Tacitus said it came from a group called the Tungrians. Julius Caesar was the first to write the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about his wars. He learned this name from people called the Gauls. Some think the name comes from the word for \"spear,\" while others say it means \"to shout\" in an old language.\n\nTacitus wrote in the year 98 that the German people were different from others. He thought they had always lived in their land and did not come from somewhere else. He asked why anyone would want to leave warm places like Asia or Africa to live in the cold, wild German lands.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germania, but they did trade with the German people. Sometimes Roman armies would go into Germania to get goods or fight. The German people lived near the edge of the Roman Empire. They sold things they made and found in their land. Many German men also worked as soldiers in the Roman army.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, we see how hiding one's true self can help someone for a time, but can also cause problems. The story shows that people must eventually return to their real selves, or they might lose who they truly are. When someone stops hiding, they might lose friends. So, people must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind finding out they were fooled, but others might become very angry.\n\nWhen someone pretends to be the opposite sex, it raises many questions. The main question is why they feel they must hide who they are. In the story, Viola does this to stay safe. She says she needs help to serve a noble man, and must hide her women's clothes.\n\nViola arrives in a strange place and thinks she must act like a man to protect herself. This works, but it keeps her from making friends with other women. Things get harder when Olivia thinks Viola is really a man named Sebastian and falls in love with her. Also, Viola must deal with her own feelings for Orsino, who thinks she is a man.\n\nToday's readers might see the play differently. It shows how pretending to be someone else can bring hidden feelings into the open. This is true for both Olivia and Orsino. We might wonder if Olivia loves Viola because she looks like a man, or if Olivia might have deeper, hidden feelings for women. But this is probably not what the writer meant. Shakespeare likely wanted to make fun of people who only care about how others look.\n\nWe can see this when Olivia quickly changes her love from Viola (who she knows as Cesario) to Sebastian. After this, she starts to think of Viola as family instead of someone to love, calling her \"sister.\"",
            "German control of its colonies was often cruel, especially in South West Africa where many local people were killed. However, the way Germans ruled their colonies was different in each place. This was also true for schools. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who could read and write. Other writers also said good things about German schools in places like Kamerun.\n\nThe story was very different in South West Africa, which is now called Namibia. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach local people. But in South West Africa, they left this work to church groups and gave them little help. The government did spend money on schools for European children there. They built public schools and helped church schools that taught European children. These choices about schools affected South West Africa for many years. While other German colonies had many educated African people, most people in South West Africa could not read or write. This happened because of many different reasons in society, government, and business.\n\nMany people have written about schools in German colonies. Most of these books were written in German during the early 1900s when Germany still controlled these places. These early books just told what the schools were like. Later, books in English looked at how schools were different in each colony. One important writer named Cohen studied schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that having many European settlers in South West Africa made its schools very different from other colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa had better weather than other German colonies, even though much of it was dry desert land. Because of this, more Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white people lived in South West Africa. The next highest number was in East Africa, with only 5,336 European people.",
            "The United States and Mexico were not friendly nations for many years, from 1836 to 1893. The worst time in their relationship was during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States fought Mexico and won. As a result, the United States took control of Texas and the Southwest area.\n\nThe two countries had many differences. They did not share the same religion, culture, or ways of life. They also fought over land and other important things. This kind of problem is common between countries that share a border.\n\nThe United States has had difficult relationships with few countries in Latin America. Mexico and Cuba are the main examples because they are very close to the United States. Other Latin American countries have usually been friendly with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. In the 1800s, Americans did not like the Catholic religion that was common in Mexico. This dislike came from old problems between England and Spain, the countries that once controlled the United States and Mexico.\n\nDuring the 57 years of poor relations, the United States and Mexico had 17 different fights. Most of these fights were about problems at the border. Bad people would cross the border to cause trouble in both countries. This continued until both countries put soldiers at the border to stop it.\n\nThe problems between the two countries began to get better when Mexico started to depend more on the United States. By the late 1800s, the United States was no longer trying to take Mexican land. Instead, American businesses wanted to work in Mexico. This helped make the two countries more friendly.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I did not know about. This made me unable to work or do many normal things.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe, something I did not have when I was young. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always be sick.\" Even though I wanted to be a scientist or writer, I became a nurse instead.\n\nThen at age 46, I was alone with very little money and could not work. Today, I still cannot work. After fifteen years of getting help money from the government, I own almost nothing. I live day by day, but it is hard. I feel unsafe and worry much. While nothing is sure anymore, I know one truth: I could not have lived these years without help from my family and friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong at all.\n\nLife will always have big and small problems. No one can promise anything, and sometimes problems are too big to fix alone.\n\nI agree that in America, we should not depend only on the government, which is not working well. Instead, Americans should learn to trust and help each other again, rather than try to live alone.\n\nSome people talk about how Americans should be strong alone. But what really helped our early settlers was working together and sharing. The people who went west in wagons did not make it by being alone.\n\nSo yes, be ready for problems. I have emergency supplies: medical things, water cleaning tablets, and window covers. I have lights, batteries, matches, and stored food. If you can grow food or have a wood stove, that is good.\n\nBut most important: know the people who live near you.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince was born who would later be known as the Buddha. During his life, he left his wealthy life behind and found deep wisdom. His teachings created Buddhism, and the oldest form is called Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe religion has changed much since Buddha's time. In Sri Lanka, where many follow Theravada Buddhism, people hold a yearly water ceremony. Both religious teachers and common people join this event. While Buddha never spoke about such celebrations, they have become important to the people. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Buddhist community has had to change its basic ideas over time because of different forces, both from inside and outside their group.\n\nLet me explain some important words we will use. When we say \"inside forces,\" we mean changes that come from Buddhists themselves. \"Outside forces\" come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces try to hurt Buddhism - we call these \"harmful.\" Other forces neither help nor hurt Buddhism on purpose - we call these \"neutral,\" though they might still affect the religion.\n\nThe main ideas of Buddhism are important to understand. Buddhists believe in three special things: the Buddha (their teacher), the Dhamma (their holy books), and the Sangha (their religious community). Their holy books are split into three parts. One part has Buddha's teachings, another has rules for living, and the third part talks about deep ideas about life.\n\nThese deep ideas include beliefs that there is no eternal soul, that life includes suffering, and that nothing lasts forever. Buddhists believe people are born again and again until they understand these truths. When someone fully understands, they stop wanting things too much, stop hating, and stop being confused about life.\n\nThe religion has rules for living. Regular people follow five main rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not act badly in relationships, and do not use drugs or alcohol. Religious teachers must follow many more rules. The most important teaching is that life includes suffering, that wanting things causes suffering, and that people can learn to end their suffering."
