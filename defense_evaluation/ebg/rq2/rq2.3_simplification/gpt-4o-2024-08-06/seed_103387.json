            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture is not always the same and can mean different things. It is not just one thing or idea. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly\" is too simple. It is good to know some general ideas about a culture. But it is better to understand how culture affects negotiation. When people meet a new culture, they see it compared to their own culture.\n\nTo understand a new culture, one might learn its history or know its likes and dislikes. Instead of judging or changing it, one should accept it and work within its limits, especially in negotiation. If a person is in a foreign place, respecting traditions and beliefs helps in overcoming cultural differences.\n\nCulture is not only about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can mean long work hours or a relaxed schedule. A company's culture can be seen in how employees dress or communicate. Some companies support employees helping in charity, others limit it to certain causes. American companies show different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures may seem the same on the outside, but looking closer shows differences.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or group harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company in public. If a culture values tough bargaining, a negotiator may not rush to agree. Knowing these things helps before negotiating. It is also good for a negotiator to learn about the other person to make talks better.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This line is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It starts St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas also seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, and we want to see whose argument is better. So, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This helps us compare their arguments because they defend the same idea of God. Even though both have good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we look at St. Anselm’s argument. He says we understand through faith and look inside ourselves to find proof of God. He explains that God exists in our understanding, so we cannot imagine God not existing. This idea can be unclear, but it means we find proof of God in our minds. St. Anselm suggests we do not need outside proof to find truth about God. This belief in something without clear evidence is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas thinks differently. He says we can prove God exists through reason and evidence, without faith. This idea helps in bringing new people to Christianity because they do not need to believe without proof. They can be convinced by logic. St. Thomas gives five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that logic proves the need for God. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece, you can understand that piece’s features and existence without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward important subjects. Some of these ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit. This gives readers a certain feeling about a subject. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same reason. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives meaning to colors like white/gray and red/pink. He then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is a bit nicer and higher class. Gray is more old and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). In fact, everyone is often wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick notices Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further explains these two colors by using them for common, unimportant things: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—sameness (28). He also uses white or gray to describe plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something starts with Daisy. After a long time without any important use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform part, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this method around Daisy to give this idea of Daisy being a uniform part. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for growing food because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big demand for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists. People like organic eggs and milk too. Many organic farms give tours. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun things. This helps the landowner get help from government programs and improve the land. They can also make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land. This is because no chemicals are used in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to handle pests, weeds, and to make the soil good without chemicals. Losses can be higher than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as big farms. Other practices for helping wildlife also need more work. These include planting cover crops, moving animals to different grazing areas, removing unwanted plants, and managing plant growth for wildlife. Because of this, the landowner might need money or advice to make both money and a good environment.\n\nThe land in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in a special area that helps protect many plants and animals. Some of these are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, are becoming rare.\n\nNative Americans lived in this area for a long time. In the late 1800s, people started raising cattle and selling wood here. This land was part of an old homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website. I looked at government programs to see what a small farmer can do to lower costs and help wildlife. I found an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone might try to do on this land.",
            "There is a strong tie between brothers. It is a tie that cannot be broken. This tie has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. In hard times, the true nature of this tie shows, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother looks into another's eyes, he sees his own reflection. He sees himself as he truly is. His actions and the results of those actions show his true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a rich and colorful world. They go on a journey that will not succeed. Bitter disappointment meets strong pride in the end, and only one brother lives. This idea is shown through the main character, Doodle, and their actions, as well as through the story's view, which shows the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions come from one feeling: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to sit with in the tall pine tree behind the barn. But these things are impossible because of Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it hard for him to live. It was almost impossible for him to do hard physical activities. This was a big blow to the young main character, who had big dreams. All those dreams were crushed. He even feels some anger towards Doodle and thinks about killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think about killing his brother? But his heart softens when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave him hope! This shows that his wish to hurt was not strong. Deep inside, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that handles information. As technology has changed, the ways we describe the brain have also changed. At first, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now, a computer. When you learn about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not always exact and can lead to wrong ideas.  \n\nInformation processing begins when the senses take in signals. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The senses change these things into signals the brain can use. The brain processes this information in simple steps and more complex steps. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the simple steps help decide where the edges are and that it is a box. The complex steps help you know it is a black box, not a hole.  \n\nOnce the brain processes some information, it decides how important it is. Your brain decides what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, you do not notice each blade. But you might hear your name in a loud room. The brain processes information in many steps, and attention changes how this works.  \n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is coded. Each sense has a special way to code information. For example, words can be coded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies show that working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds with a signal going through certain brain parts. Long-term memory might be kept in the structure of some proteins.  \n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from the study of the brain. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are points for concepts, and these points connect based on how related they are. For example, “chair” might connect to “table,” which connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States entered a deep financial crisis. Many people lost jobs, the housing market failed, and important companies were hurt. This problem continues today. We must ask: why did this happen and how can we stop it? The crisis was caused by poor political choices. These choices made banks and companies give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to support these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks lost money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe crisis started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted another term. He wanted to be more popular. His government made it easier for people to get loans. This led to problems years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times said, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.\" He warned this could lead to trouble. He was right. Bad loans led to economic problems.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new way of giving loans. People used adjustable-rate mortgages and complicated financial products. These tied the housing market to other parts of the economy. Many people and markets put too much money in housing. They were at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market did crash. The financial groups that owned these mortgage products suffered. The biggest five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for low prices. Lehman Brothers closed. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to change to regular banks with more rules. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story. It is when you write about the background of the story. Sometimes, it can make readers excited. Other times, it can make them bored. Some people, like Dr. Merlin, get upset when there is too much information that is not interesting.\n\nExposition can be hard to write well.\n\nMany writers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, writers like Dr. Merlin write long parts where nothing happens, or too much happens. Exposition can be the part of you that wants to tell all the history before the story gets good. \n\nExposition is telling the audience what happened. In movies, it happens when one character explains a lot to another, like in a story. In books, the author tells this information.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you might read that the heroine met a man, they got married, and then he was killed in front of her. You would not want this to take two pages with only a few lines of talking. You would expect the author to show how the husband loved his wife and how the heroine's life was better because of him. This would help you care about what happens to him and understand more about the heroine. You would feel sad when he dies and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more detail in the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details. Sometimes you want to move quickly past some parts. Maybe you introduce a new character. He used to be in the Air Force, is now a night manager at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. It was still developing. They said he stabbed her many times. He was arrested. I think the time spent on this story was right.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting early in the morning. A young man named Travis Buyers, 18, was shot. It happened in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly. No one was arrested, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short. I think this might be because the victim was a black man, or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have seen that news often does not give much attention to crimes against minorities. If a white person is a victim, the news talks a lot. If it is a minority person, it might not be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offers a reward of five thousand dollars for information that leads to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this was short. They wanted people to stay tuned.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug leader in Texas. He was convicted of sending large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They said he was sentenced to 300 months in prison. They did not say 25 years. I am not sure why they said it this way. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "An ETF is a security. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund, but it trades like a stock. An ETF gives you the spread of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as little as one part in any trade. These benefits are good, but the costs of ETFs are lower than most mutual funds. You must pay a fee for any trade with ETFs, like a stock trade. There are many kinds of ETFs. Even with these benefits, a smart investor should check if the benefits, like spread, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to use the same stocks for better returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we only look at the top ten stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their parts of the total.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks show the ETF IHF, use the current % of assets to find each stock's part in a portfolio's risk and return. The portfolio is made of these 10 stocks in the same way the ETF holds them. The risk and return numbers are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks gives a return 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% rise in returns. The risk (Beta) of the top ten stocks is .12 lower than the whole ETF. It seems a portfolio of the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with lower risk. But, these two portfolios might not be very different from each other.\n\nTo check if these portfolios are very different, find the usual change of each of the top 10 stocks. Make them total 100% to compare their usual change to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was sad, and it is hard to know why it happened. Winter started at the New England campus, and fewer people were commuting by bicycle or by foot. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget to fill out the commuter log. December also starts the busy holiday time. There is a month-long break for students and teachers, and many do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester. This might explain the low number of logs for that month too. But this does not explain the low number in February. Maybe projects like this have a lot of energy at first and then decline. To stop this, we created Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March. It helped increase log submissions that month. One problem we had was keeping the project going strong. This was hard because of the natural drop in interest and the holiday and semester breaks in schools. \n\nAnother problem for this project is that people like to drive their cars. They like the freedom and flexibility. This is a big part of our culture. So, we need to give reasons to try other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. Some were for larger chain stores too. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. We could have given a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The type of prizes did not change during the project. If the prizes grew in value, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had added a few bicycles in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, maybe more people would have joined instead of less.",
            "I looked at the early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I chose to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study focused on describing how most trick films were made and looking at some changes in a few later films. Most trick films at the turn of the century are set in one place. They are filmed like a stage play, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots and follow the rule of one shot equals one film. Some early twentieth-century films break these rules by using more than one shot. \n\nOne noticeable thing about these trick films is they are filmed inside a set that looks like a stage. The camera stays in one place and does not move to follow people or things. This style was common in early films and came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. Because of this, people in trick films usually move side-to-side, not toward or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth. Even when they leave the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe stage style also means shots are often long shots and sometimes medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like in theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees the whole performance framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not move toward the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one idea equals one film. This means most trick films are about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the story in trick films; most show short tricks like magic or switching acts with little story. In a trick film, one idea to the viewer does not mean one physical shot. One \"shot\" might be several joined together to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. If you look closely, you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange term, meaning \"Old-New.\" Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both liked and disliked the Gothic style. Some say it has no real depth, while others say it brings out a strong feeling. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make the first Gothic story. Walpole uses old play parts and new nature-like writing to tell \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style looks back at old plays, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto came out, \"gothic\" meant many things. It was seen as old-fashioned next to new ideas. The mix of old Gothic and the new novel style lets readers see the characters' minds. This keeps Gothic alive, even if it seems old and new at the same time.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. In the past, chivalry was how to train a knight. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is key for Gothic writers because knights were brave and honorable. Writers like Walpole thought society lacked these traits. They used chivalry to make the past seem better and to try to make the present better. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during hard political times. He was worried about the future. He might have felt that the goodness of the past was lost in his time. This idea is clear in the character Frederic. Before meeting him, we know Frederic shows many knightly traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of a \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is overdone, showing the Gothic love for excess.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained how to plan, carry out, and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. The production stage decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers need to know what customers want. To find out, they can look at the market. The market helps decide what customers need. After looking at the market, managers know what products to make and how many to make. They then choose where to produce these products and which plant is best for the amount and quality. They must keep customer satisfaction in mind. After choosing the location, managers plan work schedules and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail matters. If not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have clear plans for everything, from how uniforms look to getting shipments from trucks. Clear plans help a company work well without confusion.\n\nThe second main part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making key decisions about what a facility can do and who to partner with. A company may have different parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose the best part for each process. Managers might also decide to hire other companies to do the work. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps create speed. Speed means giving quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often focus a lot on detail and high society. But two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. This helps us understand why the characters act the way they do.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" mysterious events show what is happening inside Oliver's mind. These moments are like dreams. They show what hurts him and what he knows about the world around him. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers being shot. It feels like a dream. He tries to get help. This shows he had no control over what happened. Oliver's senses are numb, and he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that takes him away. The pain is always there, linked with fear. This makes us ask who caused Oliver's problems since it was not him. The shooting shows Oliver has no control. He does not try to change events, even when in danger. This passage hints that Oliver feels defeated, as if Fagin is breaking him. Oliver may be starting to accept despair, which affects how he reacts. If not, Oliver would try to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program helping young students. I tried my best to help them with any subject they found difficult, but I was best at English and reading. One of the teachers asked me to help a boy named Adrian. I think he was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had a lot of trouble reading. I noticed something strange; he had unusual problems. He could say some letters perfectly, but others not at all. It was very odd. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We worked together until I met his mother. I was watching a few students who did not go on a field trip when Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. With my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I realized that Adrian could read fine; he just did not know the English alphabet well. I do not know if this helped Adrian, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI share this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even a child who speaks perfect English can have trouble reading it. We know this problem exists, so what can we do? For Adrian, the solution was simple: help with English reading, especially the alphabet and sounds. But for children who barely speak English, it is more complex. There is no one solution. We need to combine different ways: dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is a good idea. It helps not just children who speak Spanish first, but all children. Children in bilingual programs often do better in school. Some fear it is a waste of resources and helps few children. But that is not true. If we use these programs more, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, we hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions from their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they can see. We may follow one belief, then later change to another. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our view of spirituality. We look for a light to lead us from dark to sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoking. The rain came down, drowning plants by the porch. He looked at the rain, half searching and half remembering. He had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was less than I remembered. He looked at the rain, not at me. I felt alone and afraid. I could not tell my father how much I would miss him because that would make it real. I hugged him, sat again, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain but kept him alive longer than doctors thought. I did not know the value of that extra time. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone at night, I said no prayers. If God was there, he did not listen to me.\n\nI did not want to see him go from this life to another. So I did not. I could not watch him leave. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than others did. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days and waited.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. His work in farming and his time in politics made him known for caring a lot about personal freedom and government. His love for farming shaped almost all his ideas about government. He wanted to keep and grow what he thought was the best job. This influenced his views on who has power, what the Constitution means, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could make a perfect system. He thought this because there was no old way of doing things to stop the makers of the government from creating a system where people rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights of people. He thought these rights depend on each other. If one right is taken away, all rights lose value. These rights should be safe from government control. He said that in a \"state of nature,\" those with strength and bad intentions would benefit. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be made that considers both the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong views on right and wrong. He said that since humans run the government, all its good and bad traits are human. He said good ideas in government protect private property, help farming, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government with good ideas would work fairly, even if its leaders were greedy. He thought self-interest was what drove people. But it was only bad when it harmed the public good. A good government was needed to control man's bad side, and it needed watching to avoid adding bad ideas.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be followed strictly. He wanted the Federal government to have only the powers clearly given to it in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become unfair. However, he thought a simple reading of the Constitution could be risky. Without thinking about what the writers meant, this way could easily go wrong. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the true guide for the United States. It showed the country as a group of free states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, trying to understand what was in front of me. My mind was calm and quiet. I watched without feeling, studying the view without thinking deeply. Thoughts came and went quickly. It was like I had no real thoughts, just an experience of what I saw.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six. The book teaches many things, from what a pencil is to how the brain sees lines. It says to use a square frame to look at pictures. This makes a detailed picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easier to understand by focusing on just the bowl of fruit.\n\nThat day, I looked at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist’s frame. I was amazed and could only look in wonder. Picasso had a blue period, Monet liked greenery, and Italian masters used many colors. If I wanted to call my view Artistic, this was the start of my story, my Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my chosen tool. My hand moved, and my mind’s idea took shape. Water swirled, clear and clean. Pieces broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package did not move, stuck at the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the Rite Aid bathroom. A few more flushes and quiet moments, then I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand like an oven mitt. Standing up, then bending down, my hand slowly went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons come together to make driving dangerous for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience causes more deadly accidents. It also leads to more rollovers, speeding, and going off the road.  \n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. Many people know that teens often drive with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.  \n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They require temporary licenses. These licenses limit the hours teens can drive. They also do not allow other young passengers.  \n\nBut I think these temporary licenses are only a short-term fix. The real problem is that young drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even 18 years old is too young for a regular license. USA Today says Zuckerman did research that shows young people like to take risks for fun. It makes sense to wait until this risk-taking slows down before allowing teens to drive. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly accidents. By 2010, many more teens will be old enough to drive.  \n\nMaking laws to fix this problem would be simple. Schools could still teach driving classes to help future drivers learn. But no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could still be given before a full license. Teens should also have to complete a certain number of training hours. This could be based on what most states require now. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of training with an instructor and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  \n\nThe bad statistics for teen drivers come from all states. So, national laws on this issue would protect teens across the country. I think this would be effective. The idea I suggest is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose it, with common signs. Finally, it tells how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses sound information. It means the brain cannot process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear fine, but their brain does not understand sounds well, like separating words from noise.\n\nThe first talk about CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with communication problems. An Italian team made tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to study how the brain hears sounds. A conference in 1977 helped more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows in many ways. A person may not know where a sound comes from. They may have trouble telling sounds apart. They may not notice sound patterns or changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound may cover another. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, experts watch how they listen and respond to sounds. Audiologists and others use different tests. This may include questions and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that works best, and the cause is not known. Tests often have many sounds at once, asking the person to pick out words or numbers. Some tests record ear signals and check responses.",
            "I want to study social work. I hope to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are abused or neglected. I also want to help families in trouble. I have values that I can bring to social work. These values are service, respect, ethics, and a desire to help others improve their relationships. I also want to improve myself to stay good at my work. These values are important to me, not just to social workers.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was not sure which job to choose. In high school and college, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of this, I decided to study Psychology. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. After that, I took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he called the police to his parents' home. I went there to see if I could help. I told the police about my concerns. I also said I had a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents since they could not help the boy. The parents seemed nervous. They made excuses for their son’s actions. They called his behavior “manipulative.” This experience made me think about becoming a social worker to help children.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say the individual is important and mourn lost ones. Yet, we often follow old ways instead of being unique. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I am an individual. I do not want to limit myself to be like others. In high school and college, I fought against social injustice.

            "This paper talks about two ways to understand insomnia: the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model looks at genes and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects race, ethnicity, age, and money. This paper explains research about insomnia and shows how it helps us understand these models. It also talks about what is good and bad about the research.\n\nSleep problems can be main sleep problems, sleep problems linked to other mental problems, or sleep problems linked to other issues. Main sleep problems are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental issues. Other sleep problems can be due to health issues or drugs. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is trouble sleeping well for at least one month. Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake for the same time. Narcolepsy includes sudden muscle weakness or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias are about starting and staying asleep. Parasomnias are about strange behaviors or body functions in sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems involve trouble sleeping because of Axis I (like depression) or Axis II (like personality problems). This paper talks mostly about insomnia and some about main sleep problems with the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at genes, things inherited, and body issues. Neurons in the brain with orexin help control sleep and waking up. A study used mice and found GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that control sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor helps sleep when it is active. When it is stopped, it can lower anxiety and help sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) made mice sleep more (Matsuki et al., 2009). This means mice studies might help understand humans. There is a genetic and environmental reason for the GABAB receptor in people. A problem with this receptor can make sleep hard without medicine. If genes affect this receptor, it might change sleep naturally. This can hurt life areas like school, work, and tasks that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be hard for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far east on campus. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in far places like Willard building near the center of campus could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which often happens in State College. I talked to a former student who said that East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by large empty lands. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus grows, moving around becomes harder. What is the best way to get around? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus needs to be friendly for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who recently started biking again. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus; as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the quickest route to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only way to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In this story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from birth to seek happiness above all. The people are like pieces in a big game, controlled by the World Controller. If you look at the book using Marxist ideas, you see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism, such as sameness and making people into things, show that Huxley talks about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked in the book through the idea called false consciousness. This means that people do not see their true place in the economy because they only think about their own gain. This is because they are controlled by ideas like those in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own will. They are taught to buy, to spend, and to enjoy things above all. The World Controller manages this. The idea of hegemony, where one group controls others, is clear here. The lower classes do not know they are controlled and believe in an idea that keeps capitalism and buying strong. The upper classes know about it but do nothing. Only a few, like Bernard, question their role. The social class interactions show how capitalism oppresses people.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships between people. Characters are not very deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about others in a shallow way, focusing on looks and encounters. Each class is happy with its place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in the group shows Marxist ideas. The working class is made to feel superior as long as they keep buying, obeying, and fitting in with others.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a class on Islam at CBC. One big topic we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important now. After 9/11, I saw the media change from having a hostile view of Islam and extremists to being very tolerant of Islam in America. I do not think in 2001 we could have had a president with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me because what I know about Muhammad seems different from his biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would take over tribes and make them follow Islam. But in the biography, Muhammad is shown as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are also some interesting similarities between Jesus and the “miracles” of Muhammad. One is when he made food for forty men from little food. This writing makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This bothers me because it seems to take away from the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It feels like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also many stories in the biography that try to show proof of people choosing Islam by themselves. But many of these stories are from third-party sources. The author says he heard it from someone who heard it from someone else. I did not like this because it made the stories seem less true and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that they try to show Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, kind, wise, and gentle. But history shows that Muhammad was not always gentle and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life were left behind as Christian thought developed after him. If we look at this history in general, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people stay with traditional beliefs and do not accept new ideas, but they may not be strong enough to change everything. Among Christians, understanding of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what parts of Christianity came from Jesus and what was added later. It may take a long time, but it will happen: Christianity will return to its original form. A movement will grow that will take away added teachings, one by one, as if time is moving backward, until only what Jesus taught is left. When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will start to worship like in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas. The church will still be strong to lead. But because beliefs will go back in time, the many different kinds of Christian beliefs today will become more and more the same. Between regions, between different kinds of churches, we will see more similarities instead of differences. History has many examples of big changes. One example is how Christians were once harmed by the Roman Empire, but later Rome became Christian. Our country changed from having African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The big change in the future will happen in the Christian religion, going back to the start and making beliefs more the same. This process will happen by reading Jesus' words as symbols, not just as they are. What happened after Jesus' time? If we look back in history, we find Judaism, the start of the Christian religion. Belief in one God, the idea of a revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew writings were important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jewish people were not all the same. They were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally greedy and selfish. They care only about themselves and want to make their lives better. They do not care for others who are less fortunate. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The most obvious example is the owners and managers of the big factories. They want to make their companies and factories as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to show the damage caused by pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals hurt by the smoke or waste from the factories. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers who make them rich. They will do anything to make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force workers to work long hours and then fire them without notice or help. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers. This let managers and owners push workers hard and make them work in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but workers in Packingtown were expected to endure these terrible conditions both at work and at home. There were no groups to help or inform the workers. Some unions were formed, but they often took money from the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and trapped in the system that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe liked this poem a lot. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word comes from Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use this term. But there is another source that is important too. Poe liked German writers. \n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote a book called Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon. Arndt says Poe's poem is like Goethe's poem. He thinks Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was a famous writer. He wrote the poetic drama \"Faust.\" \"Faust\" was in two parts. The first was published in 1808. The second was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. \n\nIn the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries for her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both show loss and sadness. \"Faust\" was made into a play by H. P. Grattan in 1842. This was before Poe used \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He says \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it in \"Dream-Land\" twice, at the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king there loses his wife and feels lonely. He loses his will to rule or live. The poem sounds like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe knew about him, maybe because he respected Tennyson. Poe once said he admired Tennyson. Aside from Tennyson, Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after it was first published.",
            "In California, can a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra damages if the store manager acted with bad intent? The manager was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for thirty minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra damages. To ask for extra damages, a person must show that the other person acted with a willful disregard for likely harm, and that the behavior was very bad. Palmer can say Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning a spill because other customers had slipped in the past. Even with this knowledge, he did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong but still reasonable since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin still did not keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin said he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages related to her injury, and we are looking at whether to ask the judge to dismiss the claim for extra damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages for breaking an obligation if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone meant to cause harm, or if not, the action must be \"very bad\" and done with a \"willful disregard for the rights or safety of others.\" Courts say actions are malicious when done with disregard for the person's rights, when the other person \"was aware of the likely dangerous results of his actions, and still did not try to avoid them.\"",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that never went away. It started when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. At 17, she still felt it. She knew she wanted someone, not something. But she had no interest in boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but she did not like them back. She often asked herself why she felt this way. She thought about it for years but found no good answer. So she lived her life, always wondering about her wants.\n\nHer days at home were usually calm. Her parents were good, quiet people. They did not argue with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she was lively and fun. People liked her because she was nice.\n\nBut today was not calm. As she moved from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, feeling scared. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the floor, in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. The daughter ran to her mother and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother spoke with difficulty, and the daughter knew she was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help.\" Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she was strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice it. Her mind was focused on helping her mother. She carried her mother quickly and called for doctors. Some worried faces came over, and someone brought a rolling bed. They laid her mother on it and took her away to be checked. The daughter sat and waited, worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to reach a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), with a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as death from stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (instead of saturated fat), and fish. It includes fewer animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet was linked to a lower risk of death from all causes and heart-related causes. An intervention trial showed that the Med diet worked better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or death from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes. They are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake during the previous year. Over 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were classified as probable. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin use, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. From 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random changes for a person and better show long-term diet intake, average aMed scores from several FFQs were calculated. This included scores from two years before. Changes were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin use, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed group were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone at a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard over her head. The unsettling message is written with a Sharpie on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A military junta rules it. They took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests. These were the first public protests in ten years. A large number of Burmese monks led these protests. They were called \"The Saffron Revolution\" because of the color of the monks' robes. After the first few protests, more people in Burma became interested. At first, the government let the monks gather peacefully. But soon, violence grew. The military and monks clashed. The army even invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, at a protest. The official death toll says 13 people died. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the number of dead could be several thousand.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop dissent and keep control of people for a long time. Roman emperors said gods chose them to rule. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were said to lead people to prosperity. And the president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's rule. The death toll varies. Chinese government reports say 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu militia, helped by the government, started killing Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. It was a time when people of Jewish background were killed. This happened over several years and in many countries.",
            "Duke Ellington was important in jazz for many years. He was good at leading his band. Ellington played the piano in a quiet way in many songs. But he was great at writing music that showed the talents of his band members. He made songs where solo players could improvise. He also wrote music that fit the style of his band. This helped create a clear and new sound for each piece. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked together. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, Ellington used voice as a jazz instrument. This was one of the first times he used voice to add feeling and color without words. \"Creole Love Call\" also shows how Ellington worked well with his soloists. This song is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and reeds talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet plays a solo with a soft sound, adding blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays high notes with soft piano in the background.\nPart 4: The full band repeats the first part with brass and reeds talking to each other.\nPart 5: The reeds start high notes, with brass and rhythm sections playing in syncopated stop time.\nPart 6: Like the first part, with voice and reeds talking to each other. The voice uses a \"growl\" sound like an instrument.\nEnd: A short vocal run and a unique trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music often. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington used tight band play and a good ear for tone color. A trumpet and singing part talk to each other, using the voice of the trumpet and the trumpet sound of the voice. This made a rich and fitting sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" used these ideas too. Ellington used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time in the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusks form their shells over time. Our study looks at how using math models with study experiments can show how changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help us make models of shell shapes. These numbers were put into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shell shapes to understand how Prunum can change. We combine these results with other studies to better know big changes in this group.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls, and they go around an imaginary line called the columella. Whorls can grow at different speeds, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, or the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the end is the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different views: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual way to look at a shell is in the apertural view, with the opening facing you and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first suture starts. Draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening and its size.\n\nThis path can be shown with pictures and math. Once there is a math model, you can change numbers to see how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in some goals, like water and sanitation. But it is not doing well in child and mother health. It needs to do better to meet the goals by 2015. Many reasons explain why this is so. They show that Indonesia should make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in having skilled health workers at births. Now, 72% of births have skilled workers. But this number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if there are problems in pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, the numbers look better than they are. There is still much work to do. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea are treated by health workers. Information on care after birth is not complete. But it shows that this area also needs attention, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of c-section births are still lower than expected, about 4%. In cities, it is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare access is better in cities than in rural areas. Another issue is that poor people find it harder to get healthcare. There is a 27% difference in service use between the poorest and richest people. This is likely because of costs.\n\nTo improve care for babies and mothers, we need to ask how to best deal with the lack of service. Should Indonesia make specific programs, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Programs that focus on one area are appealing. They have clear goals and often show quick results. But there are problems. If we spend too much on one program, other areas may get less money. Workers may move to the area with more resources. Running many programs for the same area can lead to repeated and uncoordinated services. This means more forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past 100 years, Popular Music has grown to include many types. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups. One small group, Heavy Metal rock, has become very different and full of expression in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often dark ones. Heavy Metal is different because it can change. Soon after it started, people saw it could be flexible. They used it to make their own new kinds of Heavy Metal. This led to even more new kinds, and this continues today.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has so many small groups that it is hard to say what Heavy Metal is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, one must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement that shows darkness. It is music with more bass, more sound, more force, and more show. Metal musicians know how to play well, and you can hear it. Metal is also linked with drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange records. These records had qualities that were new to music because most popular music did not have dark emotions. Later metal got some ideas from the dark qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics in songs like Helter Skelter show this darkness.\n\nThe song Helter Skelter by the Beatles shows their darker side. It talks about ups and downs, like the effects of drugs. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made in response to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark and heavy. The Beatles wanted to show they could be heavy too, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting dreamlike pictures, the artist Henri Rousseau was making his own dreams. The Dream is a painting from 1910 by the famous Post-Impressionist artist. It shows a woman amazed by the wonders in a dream world. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted other artists and art lovers to recognize and praise his work. He had a hard time because he wanted to be accepted. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: to follow popular painting styles or to be different and unique.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one needs to know Rousseau's life story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau did not get formal art training. He worked for France as a municipal toll employee until he was forty. People mistakenly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one daughter, Julia, and much sadness. He then turned to painting for comfort and a new start. Unlike other artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau was a folk painter with the dreams of an average person in his class.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This is understandable because he had no formal art education and started painting later in life. He worked at the same time as many talented artists. Rousseau did not get much recognition until Matisse became known. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared painting in a common way, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a style that would let him join the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers say there is a close link between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn much in life from school or our experiences. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of right and wrong and beauty mostly try to explain why art or writing is beautiful or why an action is right. They are not rules for making good art or acting well.\n\nCriticism of art or morals never fully explains what is good or beautiful. Talking about da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might include ideas like foreground, background, or contrast, but these do not fully explain why it is good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or writing, people often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their features. Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we describe a piece of writing fully, there is always something beyond that. I think ethics has this same quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality, and that this special nature of both connects them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so close because we feel both deeply at a level we cannot fully explain. This link is stronger in the art of writing. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a special culture. This culture is found from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It is also in Köln near the Rhine, through the center of Germany, to Dresden on the Elbe. Germany’s culture comes from many different tribes and groups.\n\nGermania is the old land of the Germans. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians. They were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell apart the Gauls and the Germanic tribes. Some say the name comes from a Gaulish word for neighbor. Caesar wrote about the Germans and the Gauls fighting often. Others think the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the origins of Germans in AD 98. He said Germans were native to their land and not mixed with other races. He noted that people would not leave places like Asia or Africa for Germany unless it was their home.\n\nThe Romans did not move to Germania. They sent conquests for goods and sometimes led land campaigns. But they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" shows that while disguise is useful for deception, in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose themselves. Ending a deception can make someone feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping relationships. Some people will not mind being tricked, but others will be upset.\n\nThe topic of deception in changing gender roles is difficult. It raises questions, like why a person feels they need to pretend to be another gender. In Viola's case, it is to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a new place, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it separates her from other women, cutting her off from support. It gets worse when Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also struggles with her feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo some readers today, \"Twelfth Night\" shows how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario helps them face. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario seems to be a man, or does Olivia have feelings for women? It is likely not the case. Shakespeare’s Olivia might be mocking those who judge by looks.\n\nThis is clear when Olivia quickly shifts her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and sees Cesario/Viola as family, not a lover: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often very harsh. In German South West Africa, there was a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people. However, not all German colonies were the same. Each had different rules and ways of governing. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German education efforts in Kamerun were praised by writers at the time.\n\nSouth West Africa was different. In East Africa, the government made schools for native people. But in South West Africa, missionaries ran schools for natives with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on schools for Europeans in the colony. They set up state schools and supported missionary schools for Europeans.\n\nThese education policies had long-term effects. In South West Africa, most people stayed uneducated. Other colonies had more literate Africans. Various reasons caused this difference in South West Africa. This paper looks at these reasons and new research on how settlers and officials saw native Africans.\n\nThere is much writing about education in German colonies. Most of it is in German from the early 1900s. These works described the education systems. Later English works compared education in different colonies and looked at specific details. They showed big differences in education systems. Cohen’s study is a key work. It looks at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of its education system features.\n\nSouth West Africa had a somewhat mild climate, though much of it is desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. In East Africa, the next largest settler colony, only 5,336 Europeans lived.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once two nations with a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico. The U.S. gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other fights between the two nations, but they stopped just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans had different views on religion, culture, and other important issues.\n\nThis situation is similar to other countries that have long rivalries with neighbors. Countries that share borders often have conflicts of interest. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with border rivalries. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both countries are close to the U.S. and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created problems between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a common problem throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 20th century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Mexico had both ideological and interest-based struggles. But, their struggles were more about religion than political structures. The distrust between English and Spanish people carried over to the U.S. and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their rivalry. Most of these were about border issues, like raids from Mexico into the U.S. Border raids by bandits were a big problem. These raids continued until both countries used military force to control their borders. Schmitt says that the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the U.S. This happened because American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic activity in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I did not know about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted safety and security I did not have when I was a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, I was 46 years old and single, with no money saved, and I could not work. I am still disabled and have lived on Social Security Disability for 15 years. I have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is hard. Nothing in my life is sure now, but I know one thing is true. I could not have managed all these years without help from my family and a few good friends, even if I was strong. When real trouble comes, you do not feel strong. \n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big and small. There are no guarantees. No matter how well one prepares, some things are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that in the U.S., we should not rely only on big government. It is not working well. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help, instead of each person building a fallout shelter alone. \n\nIn the U.S., some people talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But really, what kept people going in hard times was compassion, respect, and sharing. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the coast alone. \n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm, and can preserve your own food, do it. It is a good idea, as is a wood stove, if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would later be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world he knew and found wisdom. His ideas led to Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It has changed since Buddha lived. We can see this change in places like Sri Lanka. There, people take part in a special water-cutting ceremony each year. Both monks and regular people join in. This ceremony is important to them, even though Buddha did not teach about such events. These changes are in both the traditions people follow and the basic beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, including both monks and non-monks, has had to change its beliefs over time. This is because of many different reasons, both from within and from outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nWe will use some terms often in this discussion. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from outside the Buddhist group. A hostile force is something that harms or wants to harm Buddhism. A benign force does not want to harm or help Buddhism, but it might do so by accident. We will use these words a lot as we talk.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which is three parts of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper ideas of Buddhism. These deeper ideas include things like Anatta, which means no soul, Dukkha, which means life has suffering, and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. When this cycle stops, so does desire, hatred, and delusion, and one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for how to live. Regular people follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in relationships, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life has suffering. Second, that wanting things causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be ended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture is not always the same and can mean different things. It is not just one thing or idea. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly\" is too simple. It is good to know some general ideas about a culture. But it is better to understand how culture affects negotiation. When people meet a new culture, they see it compared to their own culture.\n\nTo understand a new culture, one might learn its history or know its likes and dislikes. Instead of judging or changing it, one should accept it and work within its limits, especially in negotiation. If a person is in a foreign place, respecting traditions and beliefs helps in overcoming cultural differences.\n\nCulture is not only about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can mean long work hours or a relaxed schedule. A company's culture can be seen in how employees dress or communicate. Some companies support employees helping in charity, others limit it to certain causes. American companies show different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures may seem the same on the outside, but looking closer shows differences.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or group harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company in public. If a culture values tough bargaining, a negotiator may not rush to agree. Knowing these things helps before negotiating. It is also good for a negotiator to learn about the other person to make talks better.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This line is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It starts St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas also seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, and we want to see whose argument is better. So, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This helps us compare their arguments because they defend the same idea of God. Even though both have good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we look at St. Anselm’s argument. He says we understand through faith and look inside ourselves to find proof of God. He explains that God exists in our understanding, so we cannot imagine God not existing. This idea can be unclear, but it means we find proof of God in our minds. St. Anselm suggests we do not need outside proof to find truth about God. This belief in something without clear evidence is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas thinks differently. He says we can prove God exists through reason and evidence, without faith. This idea helps in bringing new people to Christianity because they do not need to believe without proof. They can be convinced by logic. St. Thomas gives five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that logic proves the need for God. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece, you can understand that piece’s features and existence without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward important subjects. Some of these ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit. This gives readers a certain feeling about a subject. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same reason. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives meaning to colors like white/gray and red/pink. He then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is a bit nicer and higher class. Gray is more old and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). In fact, everyone is often wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick notices Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further explains these two colors by using them for common, unimportant things: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—sameness (28). He also uses white or gray to describe plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something starts with Daisy. After a long time without any important use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform part, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this method around Daisy to give this idea of Daisy being a uniform part. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for growing food because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big demand for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists. People like organic eggs and milk too. Many organic farms give tours. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun things. This helps the landowner get help from government programs and improve the land. They can also make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land. This is because no chemicals are used in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to handle pests, weeds, and to make the soil good without chemicals. Losses can be higher than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as big farms. Other practices for helping wildlife also need more work. These include planting cover crops, moving animals to different grazing areas, removing unwanted plants, and managing plant growth for wildlife. Because of this, the landowner might need money or advice to make both money and a good environment.\n\nThe land in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in a special area that helps protect many plants and animals. Some of these are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, are becoming rare.\n\nNative Americans lived in this area for a long time. In the late 1800s, people started raising cattle and selling wood here. This land was part of an old homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website. I looked at government programs to see what a small farmer can do to lower costs and help wildlife. I found an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone might try to do on this land.",
            "There is a strong tie between brothers. It is a tie that cannot be broken. This tie has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. In hard times, the true nature of this tie shows, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother looks into another's eyes, he sees his own reflection. He sees himself as he truly is. His actions and the results of those actions show his true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a rich and colorful world. They go on a journey that will not succeed. Bitter disappointment meets strong pride in the end, and only one brother lives. This idea is shown through the main character, Doodle, and their actions, as well as through the story's view, which shows the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions come from one feeling: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to sit with in the tall pine tree behind the barn. But these things are impossible because of Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it hard for him to live. It was almost impossible for him to do hard physical activities. This was a big blow to the young main character, who had big dreams. All those dreams were crushed. He even feels some anger towards Doodle and thinks about killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think about killing his brother? But his heart softens when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave him hope! This shows that his wish to hurt was not strong. Deep inside, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that handles information. As technology has changed, the ways we describe the brain have also changed. At first, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now, a computer. When you learn about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not always exact and can lead to wrong ideas.  \n\nInformation processing begins when the senses take in signals. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The senses change these things into signals the brain can use. The brain processes this information in simple steps and more complex steps. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the simple steps help decide where the edges are and that it is a box. The complex steps help you know it is a black box, not a hole.  \n\nOnce the brain processes some information, it decides how important it is. Your brain decides what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, you do not notice each blade. But you might hear your name in a loud room. The brain processes information in many steps, and attention changes how this works.  \n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is coded. Each sense has a special way to code information. For example, words can be coded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies show that working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds with a signal going through certain brain parts. Long-term memory might be kept in the structure of some proteins.  \n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from the study of the brain. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are points for concepts, and these points connect based on how related they are. For example, “chair” might connect to “table,” which connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States entered a deep financial crisis. Many people lost jobs, the housing market failed, and important companies were hurt. This problem continues today. We must ask: why did this happen and how can we stop it? The crisis was caused by poor political choices. These choices made banks and companies give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to support these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks lost money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe crisis started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted another term. He wanted to be more popular. His government made it easier for people to get loans. This led to problems years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times said, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.\" He warned this could lead to trouble. He was right. Bad loans led to economic problems.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new way of giving loans. People used adjustable-rate mortgages and complicated financial products. These tied the housing market to other parts of the economy. Many people and markets put too much money in housing. They were at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market did crash. The financial groups that owned these mortgage products suffered. The biggest five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the country's GDP.

Exposition can be the part of you that wants to tell all the history before the story gets good. \n\nExposition is telling the audience what happened. In movies, it happens when one character explains a lot to another, like in a story. In books, the author tells this information.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you might read that the heroine met a man, they got married, and then he was killed in front of her. You would not want this to take two pages with only a few lines of talking.

You would feel sad when he dies and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more detail in the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details.

            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. It was still developing. They said he stabbed her many times. He was arrested. I think the time spent on this story was right.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting early in the morning. A young man named Travis Buyers, 18, was shot. It happened in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly. No one was arrested, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short. I think this might be because the victim was a black man, or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have seen that news often does not give much attention to crimes against minorities. If a white person is a victim, the news talks a lot. If it is a minority person, it might not be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offers a reward of five thousand dollars for information that leads to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this was short. They wanted people to stay tuned.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug leader in Texas. He was convicted of sending large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They said he was sentenced to 300 months in prison. They did not say 25 years. I am not sure why they said it this way. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "An ETF is a security. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund, but it trades like a stock. An ETF gives you the spread of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as little as one part in any trade. These benefits are good, but the costs of ETFs are lower than most mutual funds. You must pay a fee for any trade with ETFs, like a stock trade. There are many kinds of ETFs. Even with these benefits, a smart investor should check if the benefits, like spread, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to use the same stocks for better returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we only look at the top ten stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their parts of the total.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks show the ETF IHF, use the current % of assets to find each stock's part in a portfolio's risk and return. The portfolio is made of these 10 stocks in the same way the ETF holds them. The risk and return numbers are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks gives a return 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% rise in returns.

Winter started at the New England campus, and fewer people were commuting by bicycle or by foot. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget to fill out the commuter log. December also starts the busy holiday time. There is a month-long break for students and teachers, and many do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester. This might explain the low number of logs for that month too. But this does not explain the low number in February. Maybe projects like this have a lot of energy at first and then decline. To stop this, we created Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March. It helped increase log submissions that month. One problem we had was keeping the project going strong. This was hard because of the natural drop in interest and the holiday and semester breaks in schools. \n\nAnother problem for this project is that people like to drive their cars. They like the freedom and flexibility. This is a big part of our culture. So, we need to give reasons to try other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. Some were for larger chain stores too. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. We could have given a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The type of prizes did not change during the project. If the prizes grew in value, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had added a few bicycles in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, maybe more people would have joined instead of less.",
            "I looked at the early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I chose to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study focused on describing how most trick films were made and looking at some changes in a few later films. Most trick films at the turn of the century are set in one place. They are filmed like a stage play, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots and follow the rule of one shot equals one film. Some early twentieth-century films break these rules by using more than one shot. \n\nOne noticeable thing about these trick films is they are filmed inside a set that looks like a stage. The camera stays in one place and does not move to follow people or things. This style was common in early films and came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. Because of this, people in trick films usually move side-to-side, not toward or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth. Even when they leave the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe stage style also means shots are often long shots and sometimes medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like in theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees the whole performance framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not move toward the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one idea equals one film. This means most trick films are about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the story in trick films; most show short tricks like magic or switching acts with little story. In a trick film, one idea to the viewer does not mean one physical shot. One \"shot\" might be several joined together to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. If you look closely, you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange term, meaning \"Old-New.\" Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both liked and disliked the Gothic style. Some say it has no real depth, while others say it brings out a strong feeling. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make the first Gothic story. Walpole uses old play parts and new nature-like writing to tell \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style looks back at old plays, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto came out, \"gothic\" meant many things. It was seen as old-fashioned next to new ideas. The mix of old Gothic and the new novel style lets readers see the characters' minds. This keeps Gothic alive, even if it seems old and new at the same time.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. In the past, chivalry was how to train a knight. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is key for Gothic writers because knights were brave and honorable. Writers like Walpole thought society lacked these traits. They used chivalry to make the past seem better and to try to make the present better. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during hard political times. He was worried about the future. He might have felt that the goodness of the past was lost in his time. This idea is clear in the character Frederic. Before meeting him, we know Frederic shows many knightly traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of a \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is overdone, showing the Gothic love for excess.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained how to plan, carry out, and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. The production stage decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers need to know what customers want. To find out, they can look at the market. The market helps decide what customers need. After looking at the market, managers know what products to make and how many to make. They then choose where to produce these products and which plant is best for the amount and quality. They must keep customer satisfaction in mind. After choosing the location, managers plan work schedules and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail matters. If not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have clear plans for everything, from how uniforms look to getting shipments from trucks. Clear plans help a company work well without confusion.\n\nThe second main part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making key decisions about what a facility can do and who to partner with. A company may have different parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose the best part for each process. Managers might also decide to hire other companies to do the work. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps create speed. Speed means giving quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often focus a lot on detail and high society. But two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. This helps us understand why the characters act the way they do.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" mysterious events show what is happening inside Oliver's mind. These moments are like dreams. They show what hurts him and what he knows about the world around him. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers being shot. It feels like a dream. He tries to get help. This shows he had no control over what happened. Oliver's senses are numb, and he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that takes him away. The pain is always there, linked with fear. This makes us ask who caused Oliver's problems since it was not him. The shooting shows Oliver has no control. He does not try to change events, even when in danger. This passage hints that Oliver feels defeated, as if Fagin is breaking him. Oliver may be starting to accept despair, which affects how he reacts. If not, Oliver would try to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program helping young students. I tried my best to help them with any subject they found difficult, but I was best at English and reading. One of the teachers asked me to help a boy named Adrian. I think he was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had a lot of trouble reading. I noticed something strange; he had unusual problems. He could say some letters perfectly, but others not at all. It was very odd. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We worked together until I met his mother. I was watching a few students who did not go on a field trip when Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. With my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I realized that Adrian could read fine; he just did not know the English alphabet well. I do not know if this helped Adrian, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI share this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even a child who speaks perfect English can have trouble reading it. We know this problem exists, so what can we do? For Adrian, the solution was simple: help with English reading, especially the alphabet and sounds. But for children who barely speak English, it is more complex. There is no one solution. We need to combine different ways: dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is a good idea. It helps not just children who speak Spanish first, but all children. Children in bilingual programs often do better in school. Some fear it is a waste of resources and helps few children. But that is not true. If we use these programs more, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, we hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions from their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they can see. We may follow one belief, then later change to another. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our view of spirituality. We look for a light to lead us from dark to sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoking. The rain came down, drowning plants by the porch. He looked at the rain, half searching and half remembering. He had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was less than I remembered. He looked at the rain, not at me. I felt alone and afraid. I could not tell my father how much I would miss him because that would make it real. I hugged him, sat again, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain but kept him alive longer than doctors thought. I did not know the value of that extra time. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone at night, I said no prayers. If God was there, he did not listen to me.\n\nI did not want to see him go from this life to another. So I did not. I could not watch him leave. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than others did. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days and waited.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. His work in farming and his time in politics made him known for caring a lot about personal freedom and government. His love for farming shaped almost all his ideas about government. He wanted to keep and grow what he thought was the best job. This influenced his views on who has power, what the Constitution means, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could make a perfect system. He thought this because there was no old way of doing things to stop the makers of the government from creating a system where people rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights of people. He thought these rights depend on each other. If one right is taken away, all rights lose value. These rights should be safe from government control. He said that in a \"state of nature,\" those with strength and bad intentions would benefit. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be made that considers both the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong views on right and wrong. He said that since humans run the government, all its good and bad traits are human. He said good ideas in government protect private property, help farming, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government with good ideas would work fairly, even if its leaders were greedy. He thought self-interest was what drove people. But it was only bad when it harmed the public good. A good government was needed to control man's bad side, and it needed watching to avoid adding bad ideas.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be followed strictly. He wanted the Federal government to have only the powers clearly given to it in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become unfair. However, he thought a simple reading of the Constitution could be risky. Without thinking about what the writers meant, this way could easily go wrong. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the true guide for the United States. It showed the country as a group of free states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, trying to understand what was in front of me. My mind was calm and quiet. I watched without feeling, studying the view without thinking deeply. Thoughts came and went quickly. It was like I had no real thoughts, just an experience of what I saw.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six. The book teaches many things, from what a pencil is to how the brain sees lines. It says to use a square frame to look at pictures. This makes a detailed picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easier to understand by focusing on just the bowl of fruit.\n\nThat day, I looked at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist’s frame. I was amazed and could only look in wonder. Picasso had a blue period, Monet liked greenery, and Italian masters used many colors. If I wanted to call my view Artistic, this was the start of my story, my Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my chosen tool. My hand moved, and my mind’s idea took shape. Water swirled, clear and clean. Pieces broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package did not move, stuck at the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the Rite Aid bathroom. A few more flushes and quiet moments, then I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand like an oven mitt. Standing up, then bending down, my hand slowly went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons come together to make driving dangerous for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience causes more deadly accidents. It also leads to more rollovers, speeding, and going off the road.  \n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. Many people know that teens often drive with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.  \n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They require temporary licenses. These licenses limit the hours teens can drive. They also do not allow other young passengers.  \n\nBut I think these temporary licenses are only a short-term fix. The real problem is that young drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even 18 years old is too young for a regular license. USA Today says Zuckerman did research that shows young people like to take risks for fun. It makes sense to wait until this risk-taking slows down before allowing teens to drive. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly accidents. By 2010, many more teens will be old enough to drive.  \n\nMaking laws to fix this problem would be simple. Schools could still teach driving classes to help future drivers learn. But no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could still be given before a full license. Teens should also have to complete a certain number of training hours. This could be based on what most states require now. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of training with an instructor and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  \n\nThe bad statistics for teen drivers come from all states. So, national laws on this issue would protect teens across the country. I think this would be effective. The idea I suggest is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose it, with common signs. Finally, it tells how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses sound information. It means the brain cannot process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear fine, but their brain does not understand sounds well, like separating words from noise.\n\nThe first talk about CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with communication problems. An Italian team made tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to study how the brain hears sounds. A conference in 1977 helped more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows in many ways. A person may not know where a sound comes from. They may have trouble telling sounds apart. They may not notice sound patterns or changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound may cover another. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, experts watch how they listen and respond to sounds. Audiologists and others use different tests. This may include questions and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that works best, and the cause is not known. Tests often have many sounds at once, asking the person to pick out words or numbers. Some tests record ear signals and check responses.",
            "I want to study social work. I hope to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are abused or neglected. I also want to help families in trouble. I have values that I can bring to social work. These values are service, respect, ethics, and a desire to help others improve their relationships. I also want to improve myself to stay good at my work. These values are important to me, not just to social workers.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was not sure which job to choose. In high school and college, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of this, I decided to study Psychology. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. After that, I took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he called the police to his parents' home. I went there to see if I could help. I told the police about my concerns. I also said I had a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents since they could not help the boy. The parents seemed nervous. They made excuses for their son’s actions. They called his behavior “manipulative.” This experience made me think about becoming a social worker to help children.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say the individual is important and mourn lost ones. Yet, we often follow old ways instead of being unique. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I am an individual. I do not want to limit myself to be like others. In high school and college, I fought against social injustice. I colored my hair, wore clothes that showed who I am, and pierced my ears more than usual. I joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice and will keep fighting against social injustice.",
            "This paper talks about two ways to understand insomnia: the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model looks at genes and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects race, ethnicity, age, and money. This paper explains research about insomnia and shows how it helps us understand these models. It also talks about what is good and bad about the research.\n\nSleep problems can be main sleep problems, sleep problems linked to other mental problems, or sleep problems linked to other issues. Main sleep problems are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental issues. Other sleep problems can be due to health issues or drugs. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is trouble sleeping well for at least one month. Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake for the same time. Narcolepsy includes sudden muscle weakness or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias are about starting and staying asleep. Parasomnias are about strange behaviors or body functions in sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems involve trouble sleeping because of Axis I (like depression) or Axis II (like personality problems). This paper talks mostly about insomnia and some about main sleep problems with the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at genes, things inherited, and body issues. Neurons in the brain with orexin help control sleep and waking up. A study used mice and found GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that control sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor helps sleep when it is active. When it is stopped, it can lower anxiety and help sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) made mice sleep more (Matsuki et al., 2009). This means mice studies might help understand humans. There is a genetic and environmental reason for the GABAB receptor in people. A problem with this receptor can make sleep hard without medicine. If genes affect this receptor, it might change sleep naturally. This can hurt life areas like school, work, and tasks that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be hard for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far east on campus. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in far places like Willard building near the center of campus could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which often happens in State College. I talked to a former student who said that East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by large empty lands. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus grows, moving around becomes harder. What is the best way to get around? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus needs to be friendly for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who recently started biking again. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus; as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the quickest route to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only way to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In this story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from birth to seek happiness above all. The people are like pieces in a big game, controlled by the World Controller. If you look at the book using Marxist ideas, you see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism, such as sameness and making people into things, show that Huxley talks about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked in the book through the idea called false consciousness. This means that people do not see their true place in the economy because they only think about their own gain. This is because they are controlled by ideas like those in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own will. They are taught to buy, to spend, and to enjoy things above all. The World Controller manages this. The idea of hegemony, where one group controls others, is clear here. The lower classes do not know they are controlled and believe in an idea that keeps capitalism and buying strong. The upper classes know about it but do nothing. Only a few, like Bernard, question their role. The social class interactions show how capitalism oppresses people.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships between people. Characters are not very deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about others in a shallow way, focusing on looks and encounters. Each class is happy with its place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in the group shows Marxist ideas. The working class is made to feel superior as long as they keep buying, obeying, and fitting in with others.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a class on Islam at CBC. One big topic we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important now. After 9/11, I saw the media change from having a hostile view of Islam and extremists to being very tolerant of Islam in America. I do not think in 2001 we could have had a president with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me because what I know about Muhammad seems different from his biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would take over tribes and make them follow Islam. But in the biography, Muhammad is shown as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are also some interesting similarities between Jesus and the “miracles” of Muhammad. One is when he made food for forty men from little food. This writing makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This bothers me because it seems to take away from the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It feels like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also many stories in the biography that try to show proof of people choosing Islam by themselves. But many of these stories are from third-party sources. The author says he heard it from someone who heard it from someone else. I did not like this because it made the stories seem less true and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that they try to show Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, kind, wise, and gentle. But history shows that Muhammad was not always gentle and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life were left behind as Christian thought developed after him. If we look at this history in general, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people stay with traditional beliefs and do not accept new ideas, but they may not be strong enough to change everything. Among Christians, understanding of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what parts of Christianity came from Jesus and what was added later. It may take a long time, but it will happen: Christianity will return to its original form. A movement will grow that will take away added teachings, one by one, as if time is moving backward, until only what Jesus taught is left. When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will start to worship like in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas. The church will still be strong to lead. But because beliefs will go back in time, the many different kinds of Christian beliefs today will become more and more the same. Between regions, between different kinds of churches, we will see more similarities instead of differences. History has many examples of big changes. One example is how Christians were once harmed by the Roman Empire, but later Rome became Christian. Our country changed from having African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The big change in the future will happen in the Christian religion, going back to the start and making beliefs more the same. This process will happen by reading Jesus' words as symbols, not just as they are. What happened after Jesus' time? If we look back in history, we find Judaism, the start of the Christian religion. Belief in one God, the idea of a revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew writings were important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jewish people were not all the same. They were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally greedy and selfish. They care only about themselves and want to make their lives better. They do not care for others who are less fortunate. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The most obvious example is the owners and managers of the big factories. They want to make their companies and factories as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to show the damage caused by pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals hurt by the smoke or waste from the factories. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers who make them rich. They will do anything to make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force workers to work long hours and then fire them without notice or help. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers. This let managers and owners push workers hard and make them work in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but workers in Packingtown were expected to endure these terrible conditions both at work and at home. There were no groups to help or inform the workers. Some unions were formed, but they often took money from the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and trapped in the system that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe liked this poem a lot. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word comes from Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use this term. But there is another source that is important too. Poe liked German writers. \n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote a book called Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon. Arndt says Poe's poem is like Goethe's poem. He thinks Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was a famous writer. He wrote the poetic drama \"Faust.\" \"Faust\" was in two parts. The first was published in 1808. The second was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. \n\nIn the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries for her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both show loss and sadness. \"Faust\" was made into a play by H. P. Grattan in 1842. This was before Poe used \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He says \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it in \"Dream-Land\" twice, at the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king there loses his wife and feels lonely. He loses his will to rule or live. The poem sounds like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe knew about him, maybe because he respected Tennyson. Poe once said he admired Tennyson. Aside from Tennyson, Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after it was first published.",
            "In California, can a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra damages if the store manager acted with bad intent? The manager was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for thirty minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra damages. To ask for extra damages, a person must show that the other person acted with a willful disregard for likely harm, and that the behavior was very bad. Palmer can say Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning a spill because other customers had slipped in the past. Even with this knowledge, he did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong but still reasonable since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin still did not keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin said he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages related to her injury, and we are looking at whether to ask the judge to dismiss the claim for extra damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages for breaking an obligation if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone meant to cause harm, or if not, the action must be \"very bad\" and done with a \"willful disregard for the rights or safety of others.\" Courts say actions are malicious when done with disregard for the person's rights, when the other person \"was aware of the likely dangerous results of his actions, and still did not try to avoid them.\"",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that never went away. It started when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. At 17, she still felt it. She knew she wanted someone, not something. But she had no interest in boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but she did not like them back. She often asked herself why she felt this way. She thought about it for years but found no good answer. So she lived her life, always wondering about her wants.\n\nHer days at home were usually calm. Her parents were good, quiet people. They did not argue with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she was lively and fun. People liked her because she was nice.\n\nBut today was not calm. As she moved from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, feeling scared. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the floor, in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. The daughter ran to her mother and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother spoke with difficulty, and the daughter knew she was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help.\" Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she was strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice it. Her mind was focused on helping her mother. She carried her mother quickly and called for doctors. Some worried faces came over, and someone brought a rolling bed. They laid her mother on it and took her away to be checked. The daughter sat and waited, worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to reach a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), with a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as death from stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (instead of saturated fat), and fish. It includes fewer animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet was linked to a lower risk of death from all causes and heart-related causes. An intervention trial showed that the Med diet worked better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or death from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes. They are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake during the previous year. Over 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were classified as probable. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin use, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. From 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random changes for a person and better show long-term diet intake, average aMed scores from several FFQs were calculated. This included scores from two years before. Changes were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin use, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed group were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone at a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard over her head. The unsettling message is written with a Sharpie on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A military junta rules it. They took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests. These were the first public protests in ten years. A large number of Burmese monks led these protests. They were called \"The Saffron Revolution\" because of the color of the monks' robes. After the first few protests, more people in Burma became interested. At first, the government let the monks gather peacefully. But soon, violence grew. The military and monks clashed. The army even invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, at a protest. The official death toll says 13 people died. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the number of dead could be several thousand.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop dissent and keep control of people for a long time. Roman emperors said gods chose them to rule. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were said to lead people to prosperity. And the president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's rule. The death toll varies. Chinese government reports say 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu militia, helped by the government, started killing Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. It was a time when people of Jewish background were killed. This happened over several years and in many countries.",
            "Duke Ellington was important in jazz for many years. He was good at leading his band. Ellington played the piano in a quiet way in many songs. But he was great at writing music that showed the talents of his band members. He made songs where solo players could improvise. He also wrote music that fit the style of his band. This helped create a clear and new sound for each piece. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked together. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, Ellington used voice as a jazz instrument. This was one of the first times he used voice to add feeling and color without words. \"Creole Love Call\" also shows how Ellington worked well with his soloists. This song is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and reeds talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet plays a solo with a soft sound, adding blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays high notes with soft piano in the background.\nPart 4: The full band repeats the first part with brass and reeds talking to each other.\nPart 5: The reeds start high notes, with brass and rhythm sections playing in syncopated stop time.\nPart 6: Like the first part, with voice and reeds talking to each other. The voice uses a \"growl\" sound like an instrument.\nEnd: A short vocal run and a unique trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music often. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington used tight band play and a good ear for tone color. A trumpet and singing part talk to each other, using the voice of the trumpet and the trumpet sound of the voice. This made a rich and fitting sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" used these ideas too. Ellington used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time in the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusks form their shells over time. Our study looks at how using math models with study experiments can show how changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help us make models of shell shapes. These numbers were put into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shell shapes to understand how Prunum can change. We combine these results with other studies to better know big changes in this group.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls, and they go around an imaginary line called the columella. Whorls can grow at different speeds, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, or the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the end is the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different views: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual way to look at a shell is in the apertural view, with the opening facing you and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first suture starts. Draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening and its size.\n\nThis path can be shown with pictures and math. Once there is a math model, you can change numbers to see how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in some goals, like water and sanitation. But it is not doing well in child and mother health. It needs to do better to meet the goals by 2015. Many reasons explain why this is so. They show that Indonesia should make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in having skilled health workers at births. Now, 72% of births have skilled workers. But this number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if there are problems in pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, the numbers look better than they are. There is still much work to do. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea are treated by health workers. Information on care after birth is not complete. But it shows that this area also needs attention, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of c-section births are still lower than expected, about 4%. In cities, it is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare access is better in cities than in rural areas. Another issue is that poor people find it harder to get healthcare. There is a 27% difference in service use between the poorest and richest people. This is likely because of costs.\n\nTo improve care for babies and mothers, we need to ask how to best deal with the lack of service. Should Indonesia make specific programs, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Programs that focus on one area are appealing. They have clear goals and often show quick results. But there are problems. If we spend too much on one program, other areas may get less money. Workers may move to the area with more resources. Running many programs for the same area can lead to repeated and uncoordinated services. This means more forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past 100 years, Popular Music has grown to include many types. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups. One small group, Heavy Metal rock, has become very different and full of expression in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often dark ones. Heavy Metal is different because it can change. Soon after it started, people saw it could be flexible. They used it to make their own new kinds of Heavy Metal. This led to even more new kinds, and this continues today.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has so many small groups that it is hard to say what Heavy Metal is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, one must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement that shows darkness. It is music with more bass, more sound, more force, and more show. Metal musicians know how to play well, and you can hear it. Metal is also linked with drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange records. These records had qualities that were new to music because most popular music did not have dark emotions. Later metal got some ideas from the dark qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics in songs like Helter Skelter show this darkness.\n\nThe song Helter Skelter by the Beatles shows their darker side. It talks about ups and downs, like the effects of drugs. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made in response to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark and heavy. The Beatles wanted to show they could be heavy too, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting dreamlike pictures, the artist Henri Rousseau was making his own dreams. The Dream is a painting from 1910 by the famous Post-Impressionist artist. It shows a woman amazed by the wonders in a dream world. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted other artists and art lovers to recognize and praise his work. He had a hard time because he wanted to be accepted. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: to follow popular painting styles or to be different and unique.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one needs to know Rousseau's life story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau did not get formal art training. He worked for France as a municipal toll employee until he was forty. People mistakenly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one daughter, Julia, and much sadness. He then turned to painting for comfort and a new start. Unlike other artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau was a folk painter with the dreams of an average person in his class.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This is understandable because he had no formal art education and started painting later in life. He worked at the same time as many talented artists. Rousseau did not get much recognition until Matisse became known. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared painting in a common way, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a style that would let him join the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers say there is a close link between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn much in life from school or our experiences. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of right and wrong and beauty mostly try to explain why art or writing is beautiful or why an action is right. They are not rules for making good art or acting well.\n\nCriticism of art or morals never fully explains what is good or beautiful. Talking about da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might include ideas like foreground, background, or contrast, but these do not fully explain why it is good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or writing, people often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their features. Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we describe a piece of writing fully, there is always something beyond that. I think ethics has this same quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality, and that this special nature of both connects them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so close because we feel both deeply at a level we cannot fully explain. This link is stronger in the art of writing. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a special culture. This culture is found from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It is also in Köln near the Rhine, through the center of Germany, to Dresden on the Elbe. Germany’s culture comes from many different tribes and groups.\n\nGermania is the old land of the Germans. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians. They were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell apart the Gauls and the Germanic tribes. Some say the name comes from a Gaulish word for neighbor. Caesar wrote about the Germans and the Gauls fighting often. Others think the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the origins of Germans in AD 98. He said Germans were native to their land and not mixed with other races. He noted that people would not leave places like Asia or Africa for Germany unless it was their home.\n\nThe Romans did not move to Germania. They sent conquests for goods and sometimes led land campaigns. But they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" shows that while disguise is useful for deception, in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose themselves. Ending a deception can make someone feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping relationships. Some people will not mind being tricked, but others will be upset.\n\nThe topic of deception in changing gender roles is difficult. It raises questions, like why a person feels they need to pretend to be another gender. In Viola's case, it is to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a new place, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it separates her from other women, cutting her off from support. It gets worse when Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also struggles with her feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo some readers today, \"Twelfth Night\" shows how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario helps them face. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario seems to be a man, or does Olivia have feelings for women? It is likely not the case. Shakespeare’s Olivia might be mocking those who judge by looks.\n\nThis is clear when Olivia quickly shifts her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and sees Cesario/Viola as family, not a lover: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often very harsh. In German South West Africa, there was a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people. However, not all German colonies were the same. Each had different rules and ways of governing. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German education efforts in Kamerun were praised by writers at the time.\n\nSouth West Africa was different. In East Africa, the government made schools for native people. But in South West Africa, missionaries ran schools for natives with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on schools for Europeans in the colony. They set up state schools and supported missionary schools for Europeans.\n\nThese education policies had long-term effects. In South West Africa, most people stayed uneducated. Other colonies had more literate Africans. Various reasons caused this difference in South West Africa. This paper looks at these reasons and new research on how settlers and officials saw native Africans.\n\nThere is much writing about education in German colonies. Most of it is in German from the early 1900s. These works described the education systems. Later English works compared education in different colonies and looked at specific details. They showed big differences in education systems. Cohen’s study is a key work. It looks at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of its education system features.\n\nSouth West Africa had a somewhat mild climate, though much of it is desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. In East Africa, the next largest settler colony, only 5,336 Europeans lived.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once two nations with a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico. The U.S. gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other fights between the two nations, but they stopped just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans had different views on religion, culture, and other important issues.\n\nThis situation is similar to other countries that have long rivalries with neighbors. Countries that share borders often have conflicts of interest. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with border rivalries. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both countries are close to the U.S. and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created problems between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a common problem throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 20th century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Mexico had both ideological and interest-based struggles. But, their struggles were more about religion than political structures. The distrust between English and Spanish people carried over to the U.S. and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their rivalry. Most of these were about border issues, like raids from Mexico into the U.S. Border raids by bandits were a big problem. These raids continued until both countries used military force to control their borders. Schmitt says that the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the U.S. This happened because American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic activity in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I did not know about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted safety and security I did not have when I was a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, I was 46 years old and single, with no money saved, and I could not work. I am still disabled and have lived on Social Security Disability for 15 years. I have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is hard. Nothing in my life is sure now, but I know one thing is true. I could not have managed all these years without help from my family and a few good friends, even if I was strong. When real trouble comes, you do not feel strong. \n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big and small. There are no guarantees. No matter how well one prepares, some things are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that in the U.S., we should not rely only on big government. It is not working well. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help, instead of each person building a fallout shelter alone. \n\nIn the U.S., some people talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But really, what kept people going in hard times was compassion, respect, and sharing. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the coast alone. \n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and tape for the windows in case of a biological attack.

It is a good idea, as is a wood stove, if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would later be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world he knew and found wisdom. His ideas led to Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It has changed since Buddha lived. We can see this change in places like Sri Lanka. There, people take part in a special water-cutting ceremony each year. Both monks and regular people join in. This ceremony is important to them, even though Buddha did not teach about such events. These changes are in both the traditions people follow and the basic beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, including both monks and non-monks, has had to change its beliefs over time. This is because of many different reasons, both from within and from outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nWe will use some terms often in this discussion. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from outside the Buddhist group. A hostile force is something that harms or wants to harm Buddhism. A benign force does not want to harm or help Buddhism, but it might do so by accident. We will use these words a lot as we talk.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which is three parts of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper ideas of Buddhism. These deeper ideas include things like Anatta, which means no soul, Dukkha, which means life has suffering, and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. When this cycle stops, so does desire, hatred, and delusion, and one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for how to live. Regular people follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in relationships, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life has suffering. Second, that wanting things causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be ended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture is not always the same and can mean different things. It is not just one thing or idea. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly\" is too simple. It is good to know some general ideas about a culture. But it is better to understand how culture affects negotiation. When people meet a new culture, they see it compared to their own culture.\n\nTo understand a new culture, one might learn its history or know its likes and dislikes. Instead of judging or changing it, one should accept it and work within its limits, especially in negotiation. If a person is in a foreign place, respecting traditions and beliefs helps in overcoming cultural differences.\n\nCulture is not only about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can mean long work hours or a relaxed schedule. A company's culture can be seen in how employees dress or communicate. Some companies support employees helping in charity, others limit it to certain causes. American companies show different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures may seem the same on the outside, but looking closer shows differences.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or group harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company in public. If a culture values tough bargaining, a negotiator may not rush to agree. Knowing these things helps before negotiating. It is also good for a negotiator to learn about the other person to make talks better.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This line is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It starts St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas also seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, and we want to see whose argument is better. So, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This helps us compare their arguments because they defend the same idea of God. Even though both have good points, neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we look at St. Anselm’s argument. He says we understand through faith and look inside ourselves to find proof of God. He explains that God exists in our understanding, so we cannot imagine God not existing. This idea can be unclear, but it means we find proof of God in our minds. St. Anselm suggests we do not need outside proof to find truth about God. This belief in something without clear evidence is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas thinks differently. He says we can prove God exists through reason and evidence, without faith. This idea helps in bringing new people to Christianity because they do not need to believe without proof. They can be convinced by logic. St. Thomas gives five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that logic proves the need for God. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece, you can understand that piece’s features and existence without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward important subjects. Some of these ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit. This gives readers a certain feeling about a subject. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same reason. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives meaning to colors like white/gray and red/pink. He then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is a bit nicer and higher class. Gray is more old and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). In fact, everyone is often wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick notices Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further explains these two colors by using them for common, unimportant things: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—sameness (28). He also uses white or gray to describe plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something starts with Daisy. After a long time without any important use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform part, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this method around Daisy to give this idea of Daisy being a uniform part. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for growing food because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big demand for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists. People like organic eggs and milk too. Many organic farms give tours. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun things. This helps the landowner get help from government programs and improve the land. They can also make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming helps more kinds of plants and animals live on the land. This is because no chemicals are used in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to handle pests, weeds, and to make the soil good without chemicals. Losses can be higher than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as big farms. Other practices for helping wildlife also need more work. These include planting cover crops, moving animals to different grazing areas, removing unwanted plants, and managing plant growth for wildlife. Because of this, the landowner might need money or advice to make both money and a good environment.\n\nThe land in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in a special area that helps protect many plants and animals. Some of these are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, are becoming rare.\n\nNative Americans lived in this area for a long time. In the late 1800s, people started raising cattle and selling wood here. This land was part of an old homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website.

I found an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone might try to do on this land.",
            "There is a strong tie between brothers. It is a tie that cannot be broken. This tie has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. In hard times, the true nature of this tie shows, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother looks into another's eyes, he sees his own reflection. He sees himself as he truly is. His actions and the results of those actions show his true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a rich and colorful world. They go on a journey that will not succeed. Bitter disappointment meets strong pride in the end, and only one brother lives. This idea is shown through the main character, Doodle, and their actions, as well as through the story's view, which shows the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions come from one feeling: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to sit with in the tall pine tree behind the barn. But these things are impossible because of Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it hard for him to live. It was almost impossible for him to do hard physical activities. This was a big blow to the young main character, who had big dreams. All those dreams were crushed. He even feels some anger towards Doodle and thinks about killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would think about killing his brother? But his heart softens when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave him hope! This shows that his wish to hurt was not strong. Deep inside, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that handles information. As technology has changed, the ways we describe the brain have also changed. At first, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now, a computer. When you learn about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not always exact and can lead to wrong ideas.  \n\nInformation processing begins when the senses take in signals. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The senses change these things into signals the brain can use. The brain processes this information in simple steps and more complex steps. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the simple steps help decide where the edges are and that it is a box. The complex steps help you know it is a black box, not a hole.  \n\nOnce the brain processes some information, it decides how important it is. Your brain decides what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, you do not notice each blade. But you might hear your name in a loud room. The brain processes information in many steps, and attention changes how this works.  \n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is coded. Each sense has a special way to code information. For example, words can be coded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies show that working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds with a signal going through certain brain parts. Long-term memory might be kept in the structure of some proteins.  \n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from the study of the brain. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are points for concepts, and these points connect based on how related they are. For example, “chair” might connect to “table,” which connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States entered a deep financial crisis. Many people lost jobs, the housing market failed, and important companies were hurt. This problem continues today. We must ask: why did this happen and how can we stop it? The crisis was caused by poor political choices. These choices made banks and companies give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to support these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks lost money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe crisis started in 1999 when President Clinton wanted another term. He wanted to be more popular. His government made it easier for people to get loans. This led to problems years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times said, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.\" He warned this could lead to trouble. He was right. Bad loans led to economic problems.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new way of giving loans. People used adjustable-rate mortgages and complicated financial products. These tied the housing market to other parts of the economy. Many people and markets put too much money in housing. They were at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market did crash. The financial groups that owned these mortgage products suffered. The biggest five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for low prices. Lehman Brothers closed. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to change to regular banks with more rules. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story. It is when you write about the background of the story. Sometimes, it can make readers excited. Other times, it can make them bored. Some people, like Dr. Merlin, get upset when there is too much information that is not interesting.\n\nExposition can be hard to write well.\n\nMany writers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, writers like Dr. Merlin write long parts where nothing happens, or too much happens. Exposition can be the part of you that wants to tell all the history before the story gets good. \n\nExposition is telling the audience what happened. In movies, it happens when one character explains a lot to another, like in a story. In books, the author tells this information.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you might read that the heroine met a man, they got married, and then he was killed in front of her. You would not want this to take two pages with only a few lines of talking. You would expect the author to show how the husband loved his wife and how the heroine's life was better because of him. This would help you care about what happens to him and understand more about the heroine. You would feel sad when he dies and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more detail in the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details. Sometimes you want to move quickly past some parts. Maybe you introduce a new character. He used to be in the Air Force, is now a night manager at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. It was still developing. They said he stabbed her many times. He was arrested. I think the time spent on this story was right.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting early in the morning. A young man named Travis Buyers, 18, was shot. It happened in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly. No one was arrested, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short. I think this might be because the victim was a black man, or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have seen that news often does not give much attention to crimes against minorities. If a white person is a victim, the news talks a lot. If it is a minority person, it might not be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offers a reward of five thousand dollars for information that leads to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this was short. They wanted people to stay tuned.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug leader in Texas. He was convicted of sending large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They said he was sentenced to 300 months in prison. They did not say 25 years. I am not sure why they said it this way. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "An ETF is a security. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund, but it trades like a stock. An ETF gives you the spread of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as little as one part in any trade. These benefits are good, but the costs of ETFs are lower than most mutual funds. You must pay a fee for any trade with ETFs, like a stock trade. There are many kinds of ETFs. Even with these benefits, a smart investor should check if the benefits, like spread, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to use the same stocks for better returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we only look at the top ten stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their parts of the total.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks show the ETF IHF, use the current % of assets to find each stock's part in a portfolio's risk and return. The portfolio is made of these 10 stocks in the same way the ETF holds them. The risk and return numbers are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks gives a return 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% rise in returns. The risk (Beta) of the top ten stocks is .12 lower than the whole ETF. It seems a portfolio of the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with lower risk. But, these two portfolios might not be very different from each other.\n\nTo check if these portfolios are very different, find the usual change of each of the top 10 stocks. Make them total 100% to compare their usual change to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was sad, and it is hard to know why it happened. Winter started at the New England campus, and fewer people were commuting by bicycle or by foot. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget to fill out the commuter log. December also starts the busy holiday time. There is a month-long break for students and teachers, and many do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester. This might explain the low number of logs for that month too. But this does not explain the low number in February. Maybe projects like this have a lot of energy at first and then decline. To stop this, we created Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March. It helped increase log submissions that month. One problem we had was keeping the project going strong. This was hard because of the natural drop in interest and the holiday and semester breaks in schools. \n\nAnother problem for this project is that people like to drive their cars. They like the freedom and flexibility. This is a big part of our culture. So, we need to give reasons to try other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. Some were for larger chain stores too. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. We could have given a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The type of prizes did not change during the project. If the prizes grew in value, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had added a few bicycles in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, maybe more people would have joined instead of less.",
            "I looked at the early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I chose to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study focused on describing how most trick films were made and looking at some changes in a few later films. Most trick films at the turn of the century are set in one place. They are filmed like a stage play, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots and follow the rule of one shot equals one film. Some early twentieth-century films break these rules by using more than one shot. \n\nOne noticeable thing about these trick films is they are filmed inside a set that looks like a stage. The camera stays in one place and does not move to follow people or things. This style was common in early films and came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. Because of this, people in trick films usually move side-to-side, not toward or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth. Even when they leave the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe stage style also means shots are often long shots and sometimes medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like in theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees the whole performance framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not move toward the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one idea equals one film. This means most trick films are about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the story in trick films; most show short tricks like magic or switching acts with little story. In a trick film, one idea to the viewer does not mean one physical shot. One \"shot\" might be several joined together to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. If you look closely, you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange term, meaning \"Old-New.\" Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both liked and disliked the Gothic style. Some say it has no real depth, while others say it brings out a strong feeling. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make the first Gothic story. Walpole uses old play parts and new nature-like writing to tell \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style looks back at old plays, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto came out, \"gothic\" meant many things. It was seen as old-fashioned next to new ideas. The mix of old Gothic and the new novel style lets readers see the characters' minds. This keeps Gothic alive, even if it seems old and new at the same time.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. In the past, chivalry was how to train a knight. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is key for Gothic writers because knights were brave and honorable. Writers like Walpole thought society lacked these traits. They used chivalry to make the past seem better and to try to make the present better. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during hard political times. He was worried about the future. He might have felt that the goodness of the past was lost in his time. This idea is clear in the character Frederic. Before meeting him, we know Frederic shows many knightly traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of a \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is overdone, showing the Gothic love for excess.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained how to plan, carry out, and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. The production stage decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers need to know what customers want. To find out, they can look at the market. The market helps decide what customers need. After looking at the market, managers know what products to make and how many to make. They then choose where to produce these products and which plant is best for the amount and quality. They must keep customer satisfaction in mind. After choosing the location, managers plan work schedules and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail matters. If not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have clear plans for everything, from how uniforms look to getting shipments from trucks. Clear plans help a company work well without confusion.\n\nThe second main part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making key decisions about what a facility can do and who to partner with. A company may have different parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose the best part for each process. Managers might also decide to hire other companies to do the work. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps create speed. Speed means giving quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often focus a lot on detail and high society. But two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. This helps us understand why the characters act the way they do.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" mysterious events show what is happening inside Oliver's mind. These moments are like dreams. They show what hurts him and what he knows about the world around him. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers being shot. It feels like a dream. He tries to get help. This shows he had no control over what happened. Oliver's senses are numb, and he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that takes him away. The pain is always there, linked with fear. This makes us ask who caused Oliver's problems since it was not him. The shooting shows Oliver has no control. He does not try to change events, even when in danger. This passage hints that Oliver feels defeated, as if Fagin is breaking him. Oliver may be starting to accept despair, which affects how he reacts. If not, Oliver would try to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program helping young students. I tried my best to help them with any subject they found difficult, but I was best at English and reading. One of the teachers asked me to help a boy named Adrian. I think he was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had a lot of trouble reading. I noticed something strange; he had unusual problems. He could say some letters perfectly, but others not at all. It was very odd. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We worked together until I met his mother. I was watching a few students who did not go on a field trip when Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. With my poor Spanish, we could talk a little. Then I realized that Adrian could read fine; he just did not know the English alphabet well. I do not know if this helped Adrian, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI share this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even a child who speaks perfect English can have trouble reading it. We know this problem exists, so what can we do? For Adrian, the solution was simple: help with English reading, especially the alphabet and sounds. But for children who barely speak English, it is more complex. There is no one solution. We need to combine different ways: dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is a good idea. It helps not just children who speak Spanish first, but all children. Children in bilingual programs often do better in school. Some fear it is a waste of resources and helps few children. But that is not true. If we use these programs more, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, we hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions from their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they can see. We may follow one belief, then later change to another. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our view of spirituality. We look for a light to lead us from dark to sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoking. The rain came down, drowning plants by the porch. He looked at the rain, half searching and half remembering. He had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was less than I remembered. He looked at the rain, not at me. I felt alone and afraid. I could not tell my father how much I would miss him because that would make it real. I hugged him, sat again, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain but kept him alive longer than doctors thought. I did not know the value of that extra time. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone at night, I said no prayers. If God was there, he did not listen to me.\n\nI did not want to see him go from this life to another. So I did not. I could not watch him leave. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than others did. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days and waited.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. His work in farming and his time in politics made him known for caring a lot about personal freedom and government. His love for farming shaped almost all his ideas about government. He wanted to keep and grow what he thought was the best job. This influenced his views on who has power, what the Constitution means, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could make a perfect system. He thought this because there was no old way of doing things to stop the makers of the government from creating a system where people rule themselves. He strongly believed in the natural rights of people. He thought these rights depend on each other. If one right is taken away, all rights lose value. These rights should be safe from government control. He said that in a \"state of nature,\" those with strength and bad intentions would benefit. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be made that considers both the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong views on right and wrong. He said that since humans run the government, all its good and bad traits are human. He said good ideas in government protect private property, help farming, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government with good ideas would work fairly, even if its leaders were greedy. He thought self-interest was what drove people. But it was only bad when it harmed the public good. A good government was needed to control man's bad side, and it needed watching to avoid adding bad ideas.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be followed strictly. He wanted the Federal government to have only the powers clearly given to it in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become unfair. However, he thought a simple reading of the Constitution could be risky. Without thinking about what the writers meant, this way could easily go wrong. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the true guide for the United States. It showed the country as a group of free states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, trying to understand what was in front of me. My mind was calm and quiet. I watched without feeling, studying the view without thinking deeply. Thoughts came and went quickly. It was like I had no real thoughts, just an experience of what I saw.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six. The book teaches many things, from what a pencil is to how the brain sees lines. It says to use a square frame to look at pictures. This makes a detailed picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easier to understand by focusing on just the bowl of fruit.\n\nThat day, I looked at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist’s frame. I was amazed and could only look in wonder. Picasso had a blue period, Monet liked greenery, and Italian masters used many colors. If I wanted to call my view Artistic, this was the start of my story, my Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my chosen tool. My hand moved, and my mind’s idea took shape. Water swirled, clear and clean. Pieces broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package did not move, stuck at the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the Rite Aid bathroom. A few more flushes and quiet moments, then I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand like an oven mitt. Standing up, then bending down, my hand slowly went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons come together to make driving dangerous for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience causes more deadly accidents. It also leads to more rollovers, speeding, and going off the road.  \n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. Many people know that teens often drive with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.  \n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They require temporary licenses. These licenses limit the hours teens can drive. They also do not allow other young passengers.  \n\nBut I think these temporary licenses are only a short-term fix. The real problem is that young drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even 18 years old is too young for a regular license. USA Today says Zuckerman did research that shows young people like to take risks for fun. It makes sense to wait until this risk-taking slows down before allowing teens to drive. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly accidents. By 2010, many more teens will be old enough to drive.  \n\nMaking laws to fix this problem would be simple. Schools could still teach driving classes to help future drivers learn. But no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could still be given before a full license. Teens should also have to complete a certain number of training hours. This could be based on what most states require now. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of training with an instructor and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  \n\nThe bad statistics for teen drivers come from all states. So, national laws on this issue would protect teens across the country. I think this would be effective. The idea I suggest is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose it, with common signs. Finally, it tells how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses sound information. It means the brain cannot process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear fine, but their brain does not understand sounds well, like separating words from noise.\n\nThe first talk about CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with communication problems. An Italian team made tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to study how the brain hears sounds. A conference in 1977 helped more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows in many ways. A person may not know where a sound comes from. They may have trouble telling sounds apart. They may not notice sound patterns or changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound may cover another. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, experts watch how they listen and respond to sounds. Audiologists and others use different tests. This may include questions and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that works best, and the cause is not known. Tests often have many sounds at once, asking the person to pick out words or numbers. Some tests record ear signals and check responses.",
            "I want to study social work. I hope to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are abused or neglected. I also want to help families in trouble. I have values that I can bring to social work. These values are service, respect, ethics, and a desire to help others improve their relationships. I also want to improve myself to stay good at my work. These values are important to me, not just to social workers.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was not sure which job to choose. In high school and college, I saw many people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of this, I decided to study Psychology. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. After that, I took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he called the police to his parents' home. I went there to see if I could help. I told the police about my concerns. I also said I had a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents since they could not help the boy. The parents seemed nervous. They made excuses for their son’s actions. They called his behavior “manipulative.” This experience made me think about becoming a social worker to help children.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say the individual is important and mourn lost ones. Yet, we often follow old ways instead of being unique. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I am an individual. I do not want to limit myself to be like others. In high school and college, I fought against social injustice. I colored my hair, wore clothes that showed who I am, and pierced my ears more than usual. I joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice and will keep fighting against social injustice.",
            "This paper talks about two ways to understand insomnia: the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model looks at genes and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects race, ethnicity, age, and money. This paper explains research about insomnia and shows how it helps us understand these models. It also talks about what is good and bad about the research.\n\nSleep problems can be main sleep problems, sleep problems linked to other mental problems, or sleep problems linked to other issues. Main sleep problems are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental issues. Other sleep problems can be due to health issues or drugs. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is trouble sleeping well for at least one month. Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake for the same time. Narcolepsy includes sudden muscle weakness or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias are about starting and staying asleep. Parasomnias are about strange behaviors or body functions in sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems linked to other mental problems involve trouble sleeping because of Axis I (like depression) or Axis II (like personality problems). This paper talks mostly about insomnia and some about main sleep problems with the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at genes, things inherited, and body issues. Neurons in the brain with orexin help control sleep and waking up. A study used mice and found GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that control sleep and wake states. The GABAA receptor helps sleep when it is active. When it is stopped, it can lower anxiety and help sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) made mice sleep more (Matsuki et al., 2009). This means mice studies might help understand humans. There is a genetic and environmental reason for the GABAB receptor in people. A problem with this receptor can make sleep hard without medicine. If genes affect this receptor, it might change sleep naturally. This can hurt life areas like school, work, and tasks that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be hard for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far east on campus. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in far places like Willard building near the center of campus could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which often happens in State College. I talked to a former student who said that East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by large empty lands. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus grows, moving around becomes harder. What is the best way to get around? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus needs to be friendly for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who recently started biking again. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus; as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the quickest route to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only way to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In this story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from birth to seek happiness above all. The people are like pieces in a big game, controlled by the World Controller. If you look at the book using Marxist ideas, you see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism, such as sameness and making people into things, show that Huxley talks about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked in the book through the idea called false consciousness. This means that people do not see their true place in the economy because they only think about their own gain. This is because they are controlled by ideas like those in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own will. They are taught to buy, to spend, and to enjoy things above all. The World Controller manages this. The idea of hegemony, where one group controls others, is clear here. The lower classes do not know they are controlled and believe in an idea that keeps capitalism and buying strong. The upper classes know about it but do nothing. Only a few, like Bernard, question their role. The social class interactions show how capitalism oppresses people.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships between people. Characters are not very deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about others in a shallow way, focusing on looks and encounters. Each class is happy with its place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in the group shows Marxist ideas. The working class is made to feel superior as long as they keep buying, obeying, and fitting in with others.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a class on Islam at CBC. One big topic we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important now. After 9/11, I saw the media change from having a hostile view of Islam and extremists to being very tolerant of Islam in America. I do not think in 2001 we could have had a president with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me because what I know about Muhammad seems different from his biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would take over tribes and make them follow Islam. But in the biography, Muhammad is shown as a kind of martyr, who was misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are also some interesting similarities between Jesus and the “miracles” of Muhammad. One is when he made food for forty men from little food. This writing makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This bothers me because it seems to take away from the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It feels like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also many stories in the biography that try to show proof of people choosing Islam by themselves. But many of these stories are from third-party sources. The author says he heard it from someone who heard it from someone else. I did not like this because it made the stories seem less true and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that they try to show Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, kind, wise, and gentle. But history shows that Muhammad was not always gentle and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life were left behind as Christian thought developed after him. If we look at this history in general, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people stay with traditional beliefs and do not accept new ideas, but they may not be strong enough to change everything. Among Christians, understanding of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what parts of Christianity came from Jesus and what was added later. It may take a long time, but it will happen: Christianity will return to its original form. A movement will grow that will take away added teachings, one by one, as if time is moving backward, until only what Jesus taught is left. When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will start to worship like in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas. The church will still be strong to lead. But because beliefs will go back in time, the many different kinds of Christian beliefs today will become more and more the same. Between regions, between different kinds of churches, we will see more similarities instead of differences. History has many examples of big changes. One example is how Christians were once harmed by the Roman Empire, but later Rome became Christian. Our country changed from having African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The big change in the future will happen in the Christian religion, going back to the start and making beliefs more the same. This process will happen by reading Jesus' words as symbols, not just as they are. What happened after Jesus' time? If we look back in history, we find Judaism, the start of the Christian religion. Belief in one God, the idea of a revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew writings were important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jewish people were not all the same. They were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally greedy and selfish. They care only about themselves and want to make their lives better. They do not care for others who are less fortunate. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The most obvious example is the owners and managers of the big factories. They want to make their companies and factories as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to show the damage caused by pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals hurt by the smoke or waste from the factories. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers who make them rich. They will do anything to make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force workers to work long hours and then fire them without notice or help. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers. This let managers and owners push workers hard and make them work in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but workers in Packingtown were expected to endure these terrible conditions both at work and at home. There were no groups to help or inform the workers. Some unions were formed, but they often took money from the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and trapped in the system that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe liked this poem a lot. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word comes from Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use this term. But there is another source that is important too. Poe liked German writers. \n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote a book called Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon. Arndt says Poe's poem is like Goethe's poem. He thinks Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was a famous writer. He wrote the poetic drama \"Faust.\" \"Faust\" was in two parts. The first was published in 1808. The second was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. \n\nIn the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries for her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both show loss and sadness. \"Faust\" was made into a play by H. P. Grattan in 1842. This was before Poe used \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He says \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it in \"Dream-Land\" twice, at the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king there loses his wife and feels lonely. He loses his will to rule or live. The poem sounds like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe knew about him, maybe because he respected Tennyson. Poe once said he admired Tennyson. Aside from Tennyson, Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after it was first published.",
            "In California, can a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra damages if the store manager acted with bad intent? The manager was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for thirty minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra damages. To ask for extra damages, a person must show that the other person acted with a willful disregard for likely harm, and that the behavior was very bad. Palmer can say Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning a spill because other customers had slipped in the past. Even with this knowledge, he did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong but still reasonable since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin still did not keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin said he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Mr. Martin about the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages related to her injury, and we are looking at whether to ask the judge to dismiss the claim for extra damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages for breaking an obligation if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone meant to cause harm, or if not, the action must be \"very bad\" and done with a \"willful disregard for the rights or safety of others.\" Courts say actions are malicious when done with disregard for the person's rights, when the other person \"was aware of the likely dangerous results of his actions, and still did not try to avoid them.\"",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that never went away. It started when she was 14, just entering her teenage years. At 17, she still felt it. She knew she wanted someone, not something. But she had no interest in boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but she did not like them back. She often asked herself why she felt this way. She thought about it for years but found no good answer. So she lived her life, always wondering about her wants.\n\nHer days at home were usually calm. Her parents were good, quiet people. They did not argue with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she was lively and fun. People liked her because she was nice.\n\nBut today was not calm. As she moved from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, feeling scared. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the floor, in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. The daughter ran to her mother and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother spoke with difficulty, and the daughter knew she was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help.\" Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she was strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital smelled of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice it. Her mind was focused on helping her mother. She carried her mother quickly and called for doctors. Some worried faces came over, and someone brought a rolling bed. They laid her mother on it and took her away to be checked. The daughter sat and waited, worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to reach a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), with a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as death from stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (instead of saturated fat), and fish. It includes fewer animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet was linked to a lower risk of death from all causes and heart-related causes. An intervention trial showed that the Med diet worked better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or death from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes. They are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake during the previous year. Over 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were classified as probable. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin use, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. From 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random changes for a person and better show long-term diet intake, average aMed scores from several FFQs were calculated. This included scores from two years before. Changes were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin use, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed group were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone at a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard over her head. The unsettling message is written with a Sharpie on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A military junta rules it. They took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests. These were the first public protests in ten years. A large number of Burmese monks led these protests. They were called \"The Saffron Revolution\" because of the color of the monks' robes. After the first few protests, more people in Burma became interested. At first, the government let the monks gather peacefully. But soon, violence grew. The military and monks clashed. The army even invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, at a protest. The official death toll says 13 people died. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the number of dead could be several thousand.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop dissent and keep control of people for a long time. Roman emperors said gods chose them to rule. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were said to lead people to prosperity. And the president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's rule. The death toll varies. Chinese government reports say 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu militia, helped by the government, started killing Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. It was a time when people of Jewish background were killed. This happened over several years and in many countries.",
            "Duke Ellington was important in jazz for many years. He was good at leading his band. Ellington played the piano in a quiet way in many songs. But he was great at writing music that showed the talents of his band members. He made songs where solo players could improvise. He also wrote music that fit the style of his band. This helped create a clear and new sound for each piece. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked together. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, Ellington used voice as a jazz instrument. This was one of the first times he used voice to add feeling and color without words. \"Creole Love Call\" also shows how Ellington worked well with his soloists. This song is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and reeds talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet plays a solo with a soft sound, adding blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays high notes with soft piano in the background.\nPart 4: The full band repeats the first part with brass and reeds talking to each other.\nPart 5: The reeds start high notes, with brass and rhythm sections playing in syncopated stop time.\nPart 6: Like the first part, with voice and reeds talking to each other. The voice uses a \"growl\" sound like an instrument.\nEnd: A short vocal run and a unique trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music often. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington used tight band play and a good ear for tone color. A trumpet and singing part talk to each other, using the voice of the trumpet and the trumpet sound of the voice. This made a rich and fitting sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" used these ideas too. Ellington used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time in the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusks form their shells over time. Our study looks at how using math models with study experiments can show how changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help us make models of shell shapes. These numbers were put into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shell shapes to understand how Prunum can change. We combine these results with other studies to better know big changes in this group.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls, and they go around an imaginary line called the columella. Whorls can grow at different speeds, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, or the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the end is the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different views: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual way to look at a shell is in the apertural view, with the opening facing you and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first suture starts. Draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening and its size.\n\nThis path can be shown with pictures and math. Once there is a math model, you can change numbers to see how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in some goals, like water and sanitation. But it is not doing well in child and mother health. It needs to do better to meet the goals by 2015. Many reasons explain why this is so. They show that Indonesia should make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in having skilled health workers at births. Now, 72% of births have skilled workers. But this number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if there are problems in pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, the numbers look better than they are. There is still much work to do. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea are treated by health workers. Information on care after birth is not complete. But it shows that this area also needs attention, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of c-section births are still lower than expected, about 4%. In cities, it is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare access is better in cities than in rural areas. Another issue is that poor people find it harder to get healthcare. There is a 27% difference in service use between the poorest and richest people. This is likely because of costs.\n\nTo improve care for babies and mothers, we need to ask how to best deal with the lack of service. Should Indonesia make specific programs, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Programs that focus on one area are appealing. They have clear goals and often show quick results. But there are problems. If we spend too much on one program, other areas may get less money. Workers may move to the area with more resources. Running many programs for the same area can lead to repeated and uncoordinated services. This means more forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past 100 years, Popular Music has grown to include many types. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups. One small group, Heavy Metal rock, has become very different and full of expression in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often dark ones. Heavy Metal is different because it can change. Soon after it started, people saw it could be flexible. They used it to make their own new kinds of Heavy Metal. This led to even more new kinds, and this continues today.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has so many small groups that it is hard to say what Heavy Metal is. It has taken ideas from many other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, one must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement that shows darkness. It is music with more bass, more sound, more force, and more show. Metal musicians know how to play well, and you can hear it. Metal is also linked with drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange records. These records had qualities that were new to music because most popular music did not have dark emotions. Later metal got some ideas from the dark qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics in songs like Helter Skelter show this darkness.\n\nThe song Helter Skelter by the Beatles shows their darker side. It talks about ups and downs, like the effects of drugs. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made in response to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark and heavy. The Beatles wanted to show they could be heavy too, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting dreamlike pictures, the artist Henri Rousseau was making his own dreams. The Dream is a painting from 1910 by the famous Post-Impressionist artist. It shows a woman amazed by the wonders in a dream world. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted other artists and art lovers to recognize and praise his work. He had a hard time because he wanted to be accepted. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: to follow popular painting styles or to be different and unique.\n\nTo understand The Dream, one needs to know Rousseau's life story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau did not get formal art training. He worked for France as a municipal toll employee until he was forty. People mistakenly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one daughter, Julia, and much sadness. He then turned to painting for comfort and a new start. Unlike other artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau was a folk painter with the dreams of an average person in his class.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This is understandable because he had no formal art education and started painting later in life. He worked at the same time as many talented artists. Rousseau did not get much recognition until Matisse became known. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared painting in a common way, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a style that would let him join the Artiste Français.",
            "Many great thinkers say there is a close link between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn much in life from school or our experiences. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of right and wrong and beauty mostly try to explain why art or writing is beautiful or why an action is right. They are not rules for making good art or acting well.\n\nCriticism of art or morals never fully explains what is good or beautiful. Talking about da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might include ideas like foreground, background, or contrast, but these do not fully explain why it is good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or writing, people often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their features. Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we describe a piece of writing fully, there is always something beyond that. I think ethics has this same quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality, and that this special nature of both connects them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so close because we feel both deeply at a level we cannot fully explain. This link is stronger in the art of writing. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a special culture. This culture is found from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It is also in Köln near the Rhine, through the center of Germany, to Dresden on the Elbe. Germany’s culture comes from many different tribes and groups.\n\nGermania is the old land of the Germans. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians. They were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell apart the Gauls and the Germanic tribes. Some say the name comes from a Gaulish word for neighbor. Caesar wrote about the Germans and the Gauls fighting often. Others think the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the origins of Germans in AD 98. He said Germans were native to their land and not mixed with other races. He noted that people would not leave places like Asia or Africa for Germany unless it was their home.\n\nThe Romans did not move to Germania. They sent conquests for goods and sometimes led land campaigns. But they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" shows that while disguise is useful for deception, in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose themselves. Ending a deception can make someone feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping relationships. Some people will not mind being tricked, but others will be upset.\n\nThe topic of deception in changing gender roles is difficult. It raises questions, like why a person feels they need to pretend to be another gender. In Viola's case, it is to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nIn a new place, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it separates her from other women, cutting her off from support. It gets worse when Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also struggles with her feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo some readers today, \"Twelfth Night\" shows how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario helps them face. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario seems to be a man, or does Olivia have feelings for women? It is likely not the case. Shakespeare’s Olivia might be mocking those who judge by looks.\n\nThis is clear when Olivia quickly shifts her love from Cesario to Sebastian, and sees Cesario/Viola as family, not a lover: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often very harsh. In German South West Africa, there was a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama people. However, not all German colonies were the same. Each had different rules and ways of governing. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German education efforts in Kamerun were praised by writers at the time.\n\nSouth West Africa was different. In East Africa, the government made schools for native people. But in South West Africa, missionaries ran schools for natives with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on schools for Europeans in the colony. They set up state schools and supported missionary schools for Europeans.\n\nThese education policies had long-term effects. In South West Africa, most people stayed uneducated. Other colonies had more literate Africans. Various reasons caused this difference in South West Africa. This paper looks at these reasons and new research on how settlers and officials saw native Africans.\n\nThere is much writing about education in German colonies. Most of it is in German from the early 1900s. These works described the education systems. Later English works compared education in different colonies and looked at specific details. They showed big differences in education systems. Cohen’s study is a key work. It looks at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of its education system features.\n\nSouth West Africa had a somewhat mild climate, though much of it is desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. In East Africa, the next largest settler colony, only 5,336 Europeans lived.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once two nations with a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The biggest event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico. The U.S. gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other fights between the two nations, but they stopped just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans had different views on religion, culture, and other important issues.\n\nThis situation is similar to other countries that have long rivalries with neighbors. Countries that share borders often have conflicts of interest. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with border rivalries. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both countries are close to the U.S. and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created problems between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a common problem throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 20th century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Mexico had both ideological and interest-based struggles. But, their struggles were more about religion than political structures. The distrust between English and Spanish people carried over to the U.S. and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their rivalry. Most of these were about border issues, like raids from Mexico into the U.S. Border raids by bandits were a big problem. These raids continued until both countries used military force to control their borders. Schmitt says that the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the U.S. This happened because American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic activity in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I did not know about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I wanted safety and security I did not have when I was a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, I was 46 years old and single, with no money saved, and I could not work. I am still disabled and have lived on Social Security Disability for 15 years. I have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is hard. Nothing in my life is sure now, but I know one thing is true. I could not have managed all these years without help from my family and a few good friends, even if I was strong. When real trouble comes, you do not feel strong. \n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big and small. There are no guarantees. No matter how well one prepares, some things are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that in the U.S., we should not rely only on big government. It is not working well. But I would rather see Americans learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help, instead of each person building a fallout shelter alone. \n\nIn the U.S., some people talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But really, what kept people going in hard times was compassion, respect, and sharing. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the coast alone. \n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm, and can preserve your own food, do it. It is a good idea, as is a wood stove, if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would later be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world he knew and found wisdom. His ideas led to Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It has changed since Buddha lived. We can see this change in places like Sri Lanka. There, people take part in a special water-cutting ceremony each year. Both monks and regular people join in. This ceremony is important to them, even though Buddha did not teach about such events. These changes are in both the traditions people follow and the basic beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, including both monks and non-monks, has had to change its beliefs over time. This is because of many different reasons, both from within and from outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nWe will use some terms often in this discussion. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from outside the Buddhist group. A hostile force is something that harms or wants to harm Buddhism. A benign force does not want to harm or help Buddhism, but it might do so by accident. We will use these words a lot as we talk.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which is three parts of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper ideas of Buddhism. These deeper ideas include things like Anatta, which means no soul, Dukkha, which means life has suffering, and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. When this cycle stops, so does desire, hatred, and delusion, and one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for how to live. Regular people follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in relationships, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life has suffering. Second, that wanting things causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be ended."
