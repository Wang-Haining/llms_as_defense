            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is very important in negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is and what it is not. Culture is not all the same, and it is not one thing. It is not simple or uniform. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too general. It is good to know about a culture, but it is better for a negotiator to know what culture means for the negotiation. It is important to understand how a culture's way of thinking can change talks. When you meet a new culture, you see it through your own culture, and you compare them.\n\nTo understand a different culture, you can study its history or learn about its views. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, accept it as it is. Work within its limits, especially in negotiation. This is very important if you are in a weak position. Also, if you are in a different place, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and help move talks forward.\n\nCulture is not only about nations. Companies in a country have their own culture too. A company might expect long work hours or have a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in uniforms, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies let workers help any charity. Others only allow company-approved charities. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company. This shows there is much diversity in a society's culture. Some cultures are not as divided as American culture, and may seem the same to outsiders. But this is a sign to look closer.\n\nValues are important to understand because they explain why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or boss to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values tough bargaining will not rush to settle early. It is important to think about these things before negotiation. Also, it helps if a negotiator learns about the other person to make talks more effective.",
            "The saying \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'\" comes from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It begins St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will discuss, seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, so we will compare them to see whose argument is stronger. For now, let's assume both believe in the God of the Bible. Comparing their arguments about a different type of God would not work because they focus on one specific idea of God. I think both make good points, but neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, let's look at St. Anselm's basic argument. He says we understand God through faith, by looking inside ourselves. Anselm explains that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot think of him as not existing. This idea is a bit tricky, but it means that proof of God is in our own mind. According to St. Anselm, we do not need outside evidence to find truth about God. The existence of God is true by looking at what we know inside our minds. This idea of believing without solid evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God's existence through reason and evidence, without needing faith. This approach helps in spreading Christianity because it can attract new believers using only logic. St. Thomas uses five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, possibility, levels of goodness, and order. He shows that proof of God is in the logical need for God. Like if you know one puzzle piece is missing and you put together the rest, logic helps you know about the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually go together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he uses symbols to create meaning. He does this with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors, such as white/gray and red/pink, to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald uses white/gray to show sameness, with white being nicer and higher class, and gray being older and faded. He starts this in the beginning of the book by using these colors a lot. Daisy and Jordan are always “in white”—in fact, everyone is wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white.” The only time people do not wear white is when Nick sees Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.” Fitzgerald uses white and gray for many common things: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York,” the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” on Nick’s list, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray,” and the dog-seller is “a gray old man.”\n\nAfter Fitzgerald adds meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness. He first uses this with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers start to see Daisy as less of a character and more like something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses more of this around Daisy to give this feeling of her being a uniform addition, like the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,” and she is again in a “white” dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for farming because of its mild, sunny weather. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a large market for organic farm products in the San Diego area. Many local groups have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms give tours of their farms. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun activities. This can help the landowner get benefits from government programs. It also helps the habitat. This way, the land can be used for fun and farm tours. It can help make money or be used to teach people.\n\nOrganic farming can fill a special market. It often helps more plants and animals live in the area because there are no chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming in some ways. It needs more work and management to keep away pests and weeds and to fertilize the soil without chemicals. Losses are often greater than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as large ones. Other practices that help wildlife can also cost more work, like planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth. This can create special conditions like edge habitat or open ground. So, there are many reasons why the landowner might look for financial help or advice to make both profit and good habitat.\n\nThe land chosen in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres with chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It is in the East County Southern Foothills area of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, some butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers came in the late 1800s. This land was part of a homestead and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. I chose a piece of property from a real estate website. I looked into government programs to see what options a small farmer might have to lower costs and keep wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "There is a special link between brothers. This link cannot be broken. In this link are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other well. They often see themselves in each other. In hard times, the true nature of this link shows, whether good or bad. These feelings can cost a lot. To understand them, one must face what they bring. When a brother looks at his brother, he may see his own self. He sees himself as he truly is. Actions and their results show true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers look at this idea and the strong feelings that come with it. They travel through a vibrant world. They go on a journey that is doomed to fail. Sadness fights with pride in the end, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, Doodle, is described and their interactions. The narrator explains the complex feelings and how these affect the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions come from one feeling: pride. From when he and Doodle first go out, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach things like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother to “…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” These things are impossible because of Doodle’s weak heart. It is unlikely Doodle would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was hard for the young protagonist, whose dreams were quickly crushed. He even thought of hurting Doodle, though his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave him hope. It shows his deep love for his brother was there all along.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system that processes information. As technology has improved over time, the way we talk about the brain has also changed. Long ago, people compared the brain to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, later a book, and now to a computer. When learning about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the senses. These senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals that the brain can understand. The brain processes this sensory information in different steps. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain first uses simple information like color and shape to recognize the box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, top-down processing helps you quickly understand that it is a black box and not a hole in the white background.\n\nAfter some processing, attention decides which information is important. For example, your brain sees every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but attention helps you not notice each one. Yet, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing happens in many stages, and attention helps decide what you notice at each stage.\n\nTo process information, the brain first needs to store it. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded or changed into a form the brain can keep. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies say that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is kept by an electrical signal in a loop of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory might be kept in the way certain proteins are structured.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. This means there are nodes for ideas, and these nodes are linked based on how they relate. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which then connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost jobs, house prices dropped, and large companies suffered. This problem still affects us today. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of bad political choices. These choices made banks give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also dealt with these loans. When people could not pay back, banks did not have enough money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular to win another term. He made it easier to get loans, which later caused the crisis. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and middle income and to keep making money.” Holmes warned this could cause trouble if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad loans led to the economy's fall.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new and complex way loans were made. Loans with changing rates and mortgage-backed securities connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made families and markets borrow too much and become at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market went bad, and financial institutions with these securities lost money. The top five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers closed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks with strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and came under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. This is the part of your story where you show your writing skills and amaze everyone with your words. Or it is the part where readers get bored and stop reading. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information.\n\nExposition is not helpful.\n\nMy readers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still writes long parts where nothing happens, or too much happens. Exposition makes you want to tell all the history before the interesting parts (not like the other side, which wants to tell every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, usually in simple words. In movies, exposition is when one character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author does the telling.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got married in a big way, and her husband was killed in front of her. You would not expect all this to take two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to show the husband's character by his words and actions, showing how much he loves his wife. You also expect the heroine to show in many ways how his life changed hers. This would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their deep bond, and clues about her thoughts and dreams. You would mourn his death with her and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more than just the simple story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more detail. Sometimes it is tempting to move quickly past certain things. Maybe you are introducing a new character. You know he used to be in the Air Force, now he manages a gas station at night, was married twice, no kids, likes fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and said he looked very bad. They spent about two minutes on this story because it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it might be because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed for years that stories about crime victims who are minorities do not get much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of coverage. But if it is a minority person, it may not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They told where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this story was short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark his skin was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug leader. He was found guilty of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noticed was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I am not sure why they said it that way, maybe to make it sound worse. They also said he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock. An ETF gives you diversity like an index fund. It also has benefits of a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. These benefits are good, and ETFs cost less than most mutual funds. But you must pay a commission when you trade ETFs, like with a stock. ETFs come in many types. Even with these benefits, smart investors should check if the benefits, like diversity, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to see if one ETF is as good as owning the 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to hold these stocks for good returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we will look at only the top 10 holdings. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percent of the total assets.\n\nWe will check how well these 10 stocks show the whole ETF IHF. We use their percent of assets, making it 100%, to find what each stock gives to a portfolio’s Beta and Return. If a portfolio was just these 10 stocks in their ETF amounts, we can see their Beta and return in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows a portfolio with only the top 10 holdings gives a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% better return. The Beta of the top 10 is 0.12 lower than the whole ETF. So far, a portfolio with the top 10 might give more return with less Beta. But they may not be very different. \n\nTo find if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We make it 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit sad, and it is not easy to know why it happened. When winter starts at a New England campus, fewer people come by bicycle or walking. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. Everyone is busy finishing schoolwork and grading. Many people might have forgotten to fill out the commuter log. December is also a busy holiday time, and students and teachers have a long break. Many do not need to come to campus then. Classes start again in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. But this does not explain the low number of logs in February. One might think that projects like this have a lot of energy at the start, which then falls. To stop this, we made the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March to bring back interest. It did increase log submissions for that month. So, one challenge was keeping the project going when people lost interest and during breaks in school.\n\nAnother challenge for this project is that people like the freedom and ease of driving cars. This is a big part of our culture. So, it is important to give reasons for using other ways to commute. We gave many prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have changed participation, like giving away a bicycle or a hybrid or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The prizes did not change much during the project. If the prizes got bigger over time, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had said in December that we would add a few bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, more people might have joined instead of losing interest.",
            "I looked at early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style and to see new features in some later ones. Most trick films from this time are filmed on a set. They are filmed from the front, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots. Each film is usually one shot. But, some films at the start of the 1900s use more than one shot.\n\nA common thing in trick films is filming on an indoor set. The camera does not move to follow people or things. This style comes from theatre, vaudeville, and magic shows. Because of the stage, people in the films mostly move side to side. They do not move closer to or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move side to side. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style means shots are usually long or medium. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees everything framed by the stage. Actors do not move close to the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films use one shot for the whole film. This makes most trick films about a minute long or less, based on frames per second. It also limits the story of these films. They focus on short tricks like magic or disappearing acts. But in a trick film, one shot in the viewer's eyes may be made of several shots. These are joined to show things like appearing or disappearing. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), look closely to see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though it seems like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Some people do not like the Gothic style, while others praise it. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make a new kind of story. Walpole uses old theatre ideas and new ways to show nature in his story. The Gothic style looks back at old theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used for many different things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style mixes old drama with new story forms, which lets readers see into the characters' minds. This mix helps the Gothic style stay around for a long time. It feels both old and new to readers today.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic stories is Chivalry. Chivalry is about training knights to be brave and good. This idea is in The Castle of Otranto. Writers like Walpole thought Chivalry was missing in their time. They used old chivalric manners to show a better past and make people think about improving the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tough political time. He worried about the future. He thought that people in his time were not as good as people in the past. This idea shows up in his characters, like Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, we learn he has many chivalric traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought dead. He is like a brave knight, which is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the making of the product and then to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, created the term supply chain management in 1982. He talked about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nMaking is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. This step shows when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can look at the market to find out. The market helps decide what customers want. After understanding what customers ask for, managers decide what to make and how much. They also decide where to make the products and which plant is best for amount and quality. They need to keep customer needs and happiness in mind. After choosing the place to make products, managers set work times and care for equipment. Making is very important in the supply chain. Every detail matters. If it is not planned well, it can cost the company time and money later. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have plans for everything, like how workers dress and how to get goods from trucks. Having plans helps a company work well without problems.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making good choices about what a facility can do and deciding on outside help based on these choices. A company might have many parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose which part fits best for the different jobs of the product. Management might also choose to have other companies do some work. They do this to move fast. Moving fast means giving good quality and being flexible while keeping costs low.",

It helps us understand their reasons and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen like a dream. These reveal Oliver’s deep feelings and what he knows. In one part, Oliver remembers being shot. He feels as if it is a dream. He cannot control what happens. He sees people like Sikes and Crackit in his mind. An unseen hand takes him away. He feels pain but also fear. Oliver cannot control his bad luck. This shows he feels he has no power, even in danger. It seems like Fagin is breaking him. Oliver might be losing hope and cannot react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, time feels strange. Day and night pass quickly and slowly. The silence is long and the hours are short.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in a program after school. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had many problems with reading. It seemed strange to me. Some letters he could say well. Others he could not. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few students while others went on a trip. Then his mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I spoke a little Spanish, but we could talk. I realized Adrian read fine. He just did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows the problem is not always clear. Even a child who speaks English well can have trouble reading it. Many agree this problem is real. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading English, the alphabet, and saying words. But for children who do not speak English well, the answer is not easy. We need to use many ways to help.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is good for all children, not just those who speak Spanish first. Children in two-way programs do better in school. Some fear it costs too much, or not all children will benefit. But that is not true. If we make these programs common, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers learn two languages? No, that is not easy or fair. But we can have helpers or tutors who speak two languages.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look within for answers. Many accept the religions of their parents. But some do not believe in them at all. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. People may change their beliefs over time. Whatever path we take, we try to understand ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. We listened to the rain on the tin roof and smoked our cigarettes. The rain came down hard, drowning the plants by the porch. He looked out at the rain, as if searching or remembering. He had become thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was less than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes. I felt alone and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation did not ease his pain, but kept him alive a few more months. I could not see the value in his longer suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him die. So I did not. I could not watch the life that created me end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than others did. Dad would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for his strong views on freedom and government. He believed in a farming system, and this belief shaped his thoughts on government. Taylor thought the United States could create a perfect system because there was no old tradition to stop them. He valued the natural rights of people and said if one right is denied, they all fail. These rights should be safe from government control. Taylor said in a natural state, strong and smart people win, but in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make an ideal society, Taylor thought the government must consider the good and bad in people. He had firm ideas about right and wrong. He said government actions must be human because people run it. He defined good rules as those that protect private property, help farming, and stop capitalism. He believed a government with good rules would be fair, even if leaders were selfish. He thought self-interest drove people, but it was bad when it hurt society. A good government was needed to control man's bad side and must be watched to avoid bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted a strict reading of the Constitution. He wanted a small Federal government with only the rights and powers clearly stated in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become controlling. But he also thought a simple reading was risky and could lead to problems without understanding the writers' intent. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide for the United States because it described the country as a group of separate states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, not thinking about what I saw. I quietly studied the view in front of me. My mind looked at the picture with no feelings. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts of my own. I just saw what was there.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book. The book was called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to put a square frame around a picture. This makes a complex picture, like fruit in a kitchen, easier to see. You just see the fruit.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl before me, I could not imagine this frame. I was amazed and could only stand and look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet liked green, and Italian artists used many colors. If I thought of myself as an artist, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my tool for art. My hand moved, and I thought this could be my most creative moment. Water moved smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My hand hit the toilet handle again, trying to flush away the brown mess in the toilet. It stayed stuck.\n\nWith a mop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the toilet. I flushed a few more times, thinking quietly. Then I reached for toilet paper and wrapped my hand like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, bent down, and put my hand into the bowl, like taking a turkey from the oven on Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons cause this problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that part of the problem is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents. It also causes more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens drive worse when they travel with friends. This is something everyone knows. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study about this. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They have temporary licenses that limit when teens can drive. These licenses also stop teens from driving with other minors as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers cannot handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even age 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today says Zuckerman has done research. It shows that people under age 19-20 like to take risks for excitement. It is better to delay driving until this risk-taking goes down. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, deadly accidents will continue. By 2010, many more teens will be ready to drive.\n\nLaws to address this issue could be simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education. But no one under age 18 could drive a car. A provisional permit could be given before a full driver’s license. Teens would still need to complete a certain number of driving practice hours. The number of hours could be like what most states require now. In California, teens need 6 hours of driving with a teacher and 50 hours with an adult. Because the problem is in all states, a national law could protect teens everywhere.\n\nThe law I suggest is not a new idea.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose CAPD, with common signs. At the end, it talks about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses information from hearing. It means the brain does not process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But the brain part that helps understand sounds, like words or talking in a noisy place, does not work right.\n\nThe disorder called CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” when researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made dichotic tests to study how the brain understands different sounds. In 1977, a national meeting helped more research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can show in different ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They might find it hard to tell apart different sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or detect changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound might block another sound. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts watch how a person listens and performs on hearing tests. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. They use different tools to check hearing-related skills. This includes questionnaires and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that always works well for diagnosing CAPD, and the cause is not known. Many tests give the person many sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, like words or numbers. More advanced tests record signals in the ear and measure how the ear responds.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are hurt or not cared for. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring values to social work. These values are service, respect, being honest, and helping people get along better. I also want to improve in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job to choose. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. I saw this happen, so I chose to study Psychology. I was still unsure about my career. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009 and took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He wanted to leave his abusive parents. The next day, the boy called the police about his parents. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police about my concerns. I told them I graduated in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents. The parents made excuses. They said their son was causing trouble. After this, I thought about becoming a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is important in social work. Society says the individual is important. We feel sad when we lose someone. But society wants us to be the same as others. I am an individual. I do not want to be like everyone else.

The Sociocultural model examines how environment affects race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia explains these models and the studies chosen to help understand them. It also discusses the strong and weak points of these studies.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, related to another mental disorder, or due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories can come from medical problems or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia means trouble with sleep, and Primary Hypersomnia means trouble staying awake for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep (cataplexy) and automatic REM. Dyssomnias deal with trouble starting and keeping sleep, while Parasomnias are about unusual behaviors during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems related to another mental disorder are due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly talks about insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders looks at genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and being awake. A study with mice found GABAB receptors on these neurons affect sleep. Activating the GABAA receptor helps with sleep. If blocked, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that what happens in mice can apply to humans. It shows genes and environment affect the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could change sleep without medicine. The sociocultural side of this study is if this trait is inherited, it could affect sleep and, in turn, school, work, and daily tasks needing focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Many people, including me, find it hard to move around on campus. In my first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. This is almost the farthest east part of campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather is bad, which happens often in State College. An older alum told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and new health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another gets harder. What is the best way to fix this problem? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be built to meet bicyclists' needs.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after a few years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.” Biking is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is Pollock Road is the straightest way to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its good points, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only good option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 more minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours each week. Adding all the other walking time for classes and appointments would take more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from the start to seek happiness above everything else. The people are like pieces in a big game, following one idea given by the World Controller. If you look at the book with Marxist ideas, you see Huxley is worried about these systems. Words from Marxism like homogeny and reification show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of through the idea of false consciousness. This means normal people do not understand their real economic status. They only care about their own benefit. This happens because the ruling class controls the workers’ thoughts. In Brave New World, common people like Deltas and Gammas have no real choice. They learn to consume and spend through sleep teaching. The World Controller uses this control. Hegemony means one group rules over others, and this is clear in the story. Lower classes do not see the control. They believe in an idea that helps capitalism. Upper classes know more but do nothing; few like Bernard question their role. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships. The characters are not deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about women’s looks and women talk openly about their meetings. Each class is happy with their place, showing capitalism’s effect. They follow their role in society, which is like Marxist ideas about workers. They are made to think they are better as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. We often talked about if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is very important today. After 9/11, I saw media change from a hostile view of Islam to being more tolerant of Islam in America. In 2001, I do not think we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet interests me. I learned in the past that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography says Muhammad was misunderstood and humble. People then came to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. One is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men. The writers seem to want Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This writing makes it seem like they are taking ideas from Jesus and giving them to Muhammad.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that show how people became Muslims. But many stories come from third parties. The writer heard from someone who heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly man who was wise and gentle. But history shows a different side of Muhammad. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were left behind as Christian thought grew after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a trend toward progress. Some traditional people will not change their thinking, but they may not have enough influence. Among Christians, there will be more awareness of history. People will want to know what was added to Christianity after Jesus. It may take a long time, but there will be a change back to the original ideas. A movement will grow to remove added doctrines, like turning back time, until only Jesus' original ideas remain. This trend will spread in the United States and Europe, leading people to follow only Jesus' ideas. Churches will still be strong to guide. As beliefs become more uniform, there will be fewer differences between regions, denominations, and groups. History has many reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. Our country changed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. A future reversion will happen in the Christian religion, searching for the source and reducing diversity. This will be possible by reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not literal. \n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the start of Christian religion. Monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the Hebrew scriptures were core to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care about their own lives and do not care for those below them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The owners and managers of big factories only want to make their companies grow. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this. He says the buildings stand tall and black against the sky, with smoke rising high. This shows the damage from pollution. The owners do not care about the smoke or the waste from the pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers do not care about workers who make them rich. They want to save money. Sinclair says the place is full of jealousy and hate. There is no loyalty or decency. A man does not matter against a dollar. Workers must work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. At that time, there were few laws to protect workers.\n\nThis let managers and owners force workers to work faster in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but people living and working in Packingtown had to face these terrible conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions existed, but they often made things worse. Workers were treated badly and could not escape. They were like slaves. They were poor and depended on men as harsh as old slave drivers. Under these conditions, bad behavior was common, like under slavery.",
            "Dream-land is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this goes back to Virgil. Virgil talked about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use the word, but there is another source to consider. Poe liked German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, notes that their poems are similar. He thinks Poe copied Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for his drama Faust. Faust was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808. The second part came out in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries. He remembers his wife. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. But he keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both are about loss and drinking. Faust was made into a romantic drama in 1842 by H. P. Grattan. This was just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe talks about Thulé twice in his works. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thulé. He says it is dark and lonely. Dead friends haunt him. He sees a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king has lost his wife and feels lonely. He has no will to rule or live. The poem seems like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe would have known his work. Poe respected Tennyson, and there is a link to Goethe through Tennyson. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after the original.",
            "Under California law, if a person is hurt by slipping on applesauce in a store, they might get extra money as punishment for the store. This can happen if the manager knew about the spill and did nothing because he was having dinner. A judge might not dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money easily. To get this money, she must show the manager ignored the danger of the spill and acted badly. Palmer can say Martin should have known not cleaning the spill could harm people because other people were hurt in the store before her accident. Even if Martin’s actions do not seem very bad, it is still reasonable because six people fell in 2009 and he did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, a worker named Rich Wayne told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and could not handle it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer’s fall, five other people had fallen in the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for money for her injury and for punishment. We are thinking about trying to stop her claim for punishment money.\n\nIn California, a person can get punishment money if the other person acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Malice means trying to cause harm or acting very badly without caring for others’ safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the person knew their actions could be dangerous and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that could not be filled. This started when she was 14, just becoming a teenager. It was still there when she was 17. By then, she knew she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but no one caught her interest. She often asked herself why this happened. She thought about what could make a teenage girl feel this way. Over the years, she had ideas, but none seemed right. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and good people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she had a fun and lively personality. This made her very likable, and she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter went to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in a rushed voice. The daughter knew her mother was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she said. Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she had learned how to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital had the smell of cleaning and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice, as she was busy helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and called for help. Some worried faces gathered, and someone brought a rolling bed for her mother. They took her mother away to be looked at, while the daughter sat and worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study shows that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), with a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is linked to lower risk of long-term heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed form of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes plant proteins and uses monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat. Fish is part of the diet, with less animal products and saturated fats. Alcohol in small amounts is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet is linked to lower risk of death from all causes and heart problems. One study found the Med diet better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol in overweight people. Past studies did not focus on stroke.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63. These women had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which includes 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors looked at aMed diet scores using food reports given by the nurses. Reports were checked for accuracy. Health records or death certificates confirmed heart disease and stroke cases. If records were missing, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were in this group. Body weight, smoking habits, aspirin use, vitamin use, menopause status, and hormone use were noted. From 1986, physical exercise was also noted.\n\nTo show long-term eating patterns, average aMed scores from reports over two years were used. Changes were made for factors like age, smoking, body weight, menopause status, hormone use, vitamin use, alcohol use, exercise, and aspirin use.\n\nResearchers used a model to study the link between aMed scores and risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke separately.\n\nWomen who followed the Mediterranean diet more closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In 20 years, there were 2391 new heart disease cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke than those with the lowest scores. Their risk was 0.71 times that of women in the lowest group.",
            "The sign says Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strict military group. This group took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, people protested in the streets for the first time in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. The protests were called “The Saffron Revolution” because of the color of the monks' robes. At first, the government let the monks protest peacefully. But soon, violence broke out. The military attacked and damaged monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a protest. The government said 13 people were killed. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the bodies could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have always tried to stop protests and keep control. Long ago, Roman emperors said they were chosen by gods to rule everything. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were meant to lead their people to success. Our president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, who leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome famous examples of these actions include the protest at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Students, workers, and thinkers protested against the government. The number of dead people differs. The Chinese government said 200-300 people died. But the Chinese Red Cross said 2,000-3,000 people died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, helped by the Rwandan government, killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another example. During this time, people of Jewish background were killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington is famous in jazz for his long career and his skill in leading his band. He played piano quietly in many songs, but he was a great composer. Ellington wrote music that showed off the talents of his band members. He made music where soloists could play freely and wrote parts that fit the style of each musician. This made the whole band sound unique and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they fit together, which helped him create some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice as a jazz instrument. This song shows Ellington's skill in adding sound and color without words. It also shows how he worked with soloists. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet plays the melody with special blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high clarinet solo with a soft piano in the background.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with brass and reeds.\nChorus 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high pitch, with the brass and rhythm sections adding stops.\nChorus 6: Like the first chorus, with the voice using a \"growl\" sound as an instrument.\nTag: A short vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add sound color is a key part of his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington mixes tight band writing with sound color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox with scat singing create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas too. Here, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton plays the melody on trombone in a great way.",
            "Why do living things change over time the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, people have used math models to study how mollusks make their shells over time. Our study looks at how math models and experiments can help us understand changes in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers we could use to make models of their shells. These numbers went into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shells to see how much they can change. We combine these models with other studies to understand big changes in this group of animals.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls. They go around a line called the columella in the middle of the shell. Whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. The spire is all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds it. You can track the path of these openings using points for the center of each whorl's opening, and the size of the opening from side to side and top to bottom.\n\nYou can show this path on a graph and with math. Once you have a math formula, you can change how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. Indonesia is making progress on some goals like clean water and sanitation. But, child and mother health is not improving fast enough to meet the goals by 2015. The reasons for this will be explained below. The country needs to make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has improved the number of births with a skilled health worker. Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker. But this includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems in the pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, even though the numbers look better, more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five are getting treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea. The data on care after birth is not complete, but this is also a concern. The rates are low across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are about 4%, which is low. In cities, the rate is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare is more available in cities. There is also a big gap between rich and poor. The poor have a harder time getting healthcare because of high costs.\n\nTo improve care for mothers and newborns, we need to decide how to fix the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs, or make the whole health system better? Focusing on specific programs is attractive because it is easier to manage and gives quick results. But there are problems. Putting too much money into one area can take resources away from others. For example, more money for HIV/AIDS affects family planning. Also, running many separate programs can lead to extra paperwork and problems with organization.",
            "Popular Music has many types. Over the past 100 years, it has grown to include many different kinds. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has smaller types within it. Heavy Metal rock is one type. It has become very diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. It shows many emotions, though often they are dark. It is diverse because it can change a lot. People saw this early on and made their own new types. This led to even more smaller types, and it keeps growing.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is exactly. It includes many ideas from other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is more than just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement with a lot of darkness. It is \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more show. Less simple, more skill. People in metal bands are very good at playing music. Metal is also linked to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange music. These drugs were often blamed for this music. Metal has many dark, strong qualities. This was new because much popular music was not this dark. Later metal got ideas from dark things in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from that time show this darkness. \n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is up and down, like drugs. Some say it was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a reply to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark. The Beatles wanted to show they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "Before Surrealist artists made dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau was making his own dream art. He did this both in real life and in his mind. In 1910, Rousseau painted The Dream. This painting shows a woman amazed by the dream world she visits. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and hopes as an artist. Since he started painting, Rousseau wanted other artists and art lovers to notice and praise him. But he faced a hard choice. He had to decide if he should follow common art styles to be accepted or be different and create his own style.  \n\nTo understand The Dream, it helps to know about Rousseau's life. Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau did not learn art in school. Instead, he worked for the French toll service until he was forty. People wrongly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their children, Rousseau was left with one child, Julia, and much sadness. He wanted a new life and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was a folk painter who had the dreams of a common man.  \n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This makes sense because he did not have formal art training and started late. He painted at the same time as many famous artists. Though he worked for many years, people only noticed his art when Matisse became well-known. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that even though Matisse and Rousseau both painted, they were different. Matisse feared painting in a boring way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a traditional way to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested there is a connection between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a good reason for this. As John Keats writes in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We learn much in life through education or experience. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe rather than give rules. We try to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, instead of making rules for good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. A talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on foreground, background, contrast, or culture, but these do not explain why it is good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, “There's just something about it” before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe a work of literature, something beyond the words remains. I think ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This “something”, this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality. This special quality connects ethics and beauty.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we feel both deeply, even if we cannot explain them fully. This link is stronger in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today, Germany is a strong, united country. It has its own culture from München in the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. This culture is also in Köln on the Rhine River and in Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture is unique and comes from many sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is where the Germans come from. The name's origin is debated by experts. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, who were once called Germans. They crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He got this word from the Gauls to tell apart the Gauls he conquered from the tribes he did not. Some think it means a neighbor in the Gaulish language. Others think it comes from the spear called \"ger\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 about the Germans' origins. He said Germans were original and not mixed with other races. He wondered why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its wild lands and bad weather, unless it was home.\n\nRomans did not want to move to Germania. They explored it for goods and sometimes led campaigns there, but they mostly returned to Rome. By the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire's borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help someone trick others for a long time. But in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose who they really are. The problem with ending a trick is that it can make people feel alone. So, a person must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others will be upset and feel hurt by it.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be a different gender is especially difficult. It makes us ask why someone would hide their true identity. In Viola's case, she dresses as a man to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nViola is in a new land and thinks she must look like a man to be safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel separate from the women around her. This cuts her off from friends. Things become more complicated when Olivia falls in love with her because Olivia thinks she is a man: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has hidden feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern reader, Twelfth Night might show how pretending can reveal hidden feelings. This happens with Olivia and Orsino. Some parts of the play hint that they might have unspoken desires that Viola's disguise makes them face. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems likely that Olivia is making fun of people who only care about looks. This is clear when Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often harsh. This was clear in German South West Africa, now Namibia. There, the Germans killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But not all German colonies were the same. They had different rules and ways of leading. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also well regarded. South West Africa was different. There, the government did not set up many schools for local people. Instead, missionary groups ran most schools with little help from the government. The government spent more on schools for Europeans. These choices affected South West Africa for a long time. Most local people did not get an education and could not read or write. Many reasons led to these differences. This paper will explore these reasons and look at new studies on how settlers and leaders treated local Africans.\n\nThere are many writings about education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mostly describe schools in the colonies. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies. These studies showed big differences in colonial schools. Cohen wrote about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and explained why they were different. He said many settlers in South West Africa affected its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, unlike some other German colonies. Much of it was desert. Because of this climate, many Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In East Africa, another colony, there were only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico, taking Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other conflicts between these two countries until just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and other important matters.\n\nThis situation is similar to many countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. Countries that share a border often have conflicts. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher says that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries with long-lasting diplomatic problems with the United States. Both are close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues caused a problem between the United States and Mexico, as they have in many places throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 1800s, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy, much like they were against fascism and communism in the 1900s. The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was both about ideas and important interests. But in the case of the United States and Mexico, the struggle was about religion, not politics. This distrust came from past tensions between English and Spanish people. These feelings made it hard for the United States and Mexico to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about border issues and raids from Mexico. There were also problems with bandits and outlaws in American border towns. These issues continued until both countries used military force at their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. It finally ended when American goals changed from taking land to having economic influence in Mexico in the late 1800s.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick and disabled by an illness I did not know about before.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I needed safety and security. I did not have these when I was a child. People said, \"You will always find work; people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew older. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nBut then I was 46 years old, single, with no money and unable to work. Today, I am still disabled. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left to call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is hard. It hurts my sense of safety and self-worth. Nothing is certain. But I know one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and a few good friends. Even if I was strong, real problems can make you feel weak.\n\nEmergencies happen in life, both big and small. We cannot always be prepared. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nIn the U.S., we need to stop relying only on big government. It is not strong and is falling apart. Instead, I hope Americans learn to trust and help each other. It is better than each person building a shelter alone.\n\nSome talk about \"rugged individualism\" in the U.S. But what helped people in the past was kindness, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit: first aid supplies, water tablets, plastic for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned food. If you have land for a small farm and can preserve food, do it. It is a good idea, and so is a wood stove if you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he gave up the world and became wise. His teachings started a religion called Buddhism. The oldest group of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different today than when Buddha was alive. For example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people take part in this event. It is important to them, even though Buddha never talked about such a celebration. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and big ideas of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, both monks and regular people, had to change their beliefs over time. This is because of different forces, both from inside and outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nThere are some important ideas in this discussion. One idea is internal versus external. An internal force comes from members of the Buddhist community, whether they are monks or not. An external force comes from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force tries to harm the Buddhist community. A benign force does not try to help or hurt the community, but it might do one or the other by chance. These ideas will be used a lot in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the main ideas of the religion. Buddhists find safety in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts of Buddhist text, called the Tripitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for behavior. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep ideas of Buddhism. These ideas include Anatta, which means no soul; Dukkha, which means life is full of suffering; and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. With Sansara, desire, hatred, and wrong beliefs will also end when someone becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for life. Regular people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave sexually, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, being attached causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.

            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is very important in negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is and what it is not. Culture is not all the same, and it is not one thing. It is not simple or uniform. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too general. It is good to know about a culture, but it is better for a negotiator to know what culture means for the negotiation. It is important to understand how a culture's way of thinking can change talks. When you meet a new culture, you see it through your own culture, and you compare them.\n\nTo understand a different culture, you can study its history or learn about its views. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, accept it as it is. Work within its limits, especially in negotiation. This is very important if you are in a weak position. Also, if you are in a different place, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and help move talks forward.\n\nCulture is not only about nations. Companies in a country have their own culture too. A company might expect long work hours or have a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in uniforms, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies let workers help any charity. Others only allow company-approved charities. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company. This shows there is much diversity in a society's culture. Some cultures are not as divided as American culture, and may seem the same to outsiders. But this is a sign to look closer.\n\nValues are important to understand because they explain why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or boss to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values tough bargaining will not rush to settle early. It is important to think about these things before negotiation. Also, it helps if a negotiator learns about the other person to make talks more effective.",
            "The saying \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'\" comes from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It begins St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will discuss, seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, so we will compare them to see whose argument is stronger. For now, let's assume both believe in the God of the Bible. Comparing their arguments about a different type of God would not work because they focus on one specific idea of God. I think both make good points, but neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, let's look at St. Anselm's basic argument. He says we understand God through faith, by looking inside ourselves. Anselm explains that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot think of him as not existing. This idea is a bit tricky, but it means that proof of God is in our own mind. According to St. Anselm, we do not need outside evidence to find truth about God. The existence of God is true by looking at what we know inside our minds. This idea of believing without solid evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God's existence through reason and evidence, without needing faith. This approach helps in spreading Christianity because it can attract new believers using only logic. St. Thomas uses five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, possibility, levels of goodness, and order. He shows that proof of God is in the logical need for God. Like if you know one puzzle piece is missing and you put together the rest, logic helps you know about the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually go together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he uses symbols to create meaning. He does this with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors, such as white/gray and red/pink, to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald uses white/gray to show sameness, with white being nicer and higher class, and gray being older and faded. He starts this in the beginning of the book by using these colors a lot. Daisy and Jordan are always “in white”—in fact, everyone is wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white.” The only time people do not wear white is when Nick sees Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.” Fitzgerald uses white and gray for many common things: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York,” the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” on Nick’s list, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray,” and the dog-seller is “a gray old man.”\n\nAfter Fitzgerald adds meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness. He first uses this with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers start to see Daisy as less of a character and more like something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses more of this around Daisy to give this feeling of her being a uniform addition, like the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,” and she is again in a “white” dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for farming because of its mild, sunny weather. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a large market for organic farm products in the San Diego area. Many local groups have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms give tours of their farms. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun activities. This can help the landowner get benefits from government programs. It also helps the habitat. This way, the land can be used for fun and farm tours. It can help make money or be used to teach people.\n\nOrganic farming can fill a special market. It often helps more plants and animals live in the area because there are no chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming in some ways. It needs more work and management to keep away pests and weeds and to fertilize the soil without chemicals. Losses are often greater than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as large ones. Other practices that help wildlife can also cost more work, like planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth. This can create special conditions like edge habitat or open ground. So, there are many reasons why the landowner might look for financial help or advice to make both profit and good habitat.\n\nThe land chosen in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres with chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It is in the East County Southern Foothills area of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, some butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers came in the late 1800s. This land was part of a homestead and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. I chose a piece of property from a real estate website. I looked into government programs to see what options a small farmer might have to lower costs and keep wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "There is a special link between brothers. This link cannot be broken. In this link are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other well. They often see themselves in each other. In hard times, the true nature of this link shows, whether good or bad. These feelings can cost a lot. To understand them, one must face what they bring. When a brother looks at his brother, he may see his own self. He sees himself as he truly is. Actions and their results show true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers look at this idea and the strong feelings that come with it. They travel through a vibrant world. They go on a journey that is doomed to fail. Sadness fights with pride in the end, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, Doodle, is described and their interactions. The narrator explains the complex feelings and how these affect the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions come from one feeling: pride. From when he and Doodle first go out, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach things like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother to “…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” These things are impossible because of Doodle’s weak heart. It is unlikely Doodle would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was hard for the young protagonist, whose dreams were quickly crushed. He even thought of hurting Doodle, though his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave him hope. It shows his deep love for his brother was there all along.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system that processes information. As technology has improved over time, the way we talk about the brain has also changed. Long ago, people compared the brain to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, later a book, and now to a computer. When learning about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the senses. These senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals that the brain can understand. The brain processes this sensory information in different steps. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain first uses simple information like color and shape to recognize the box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, top-down processing helps you quickly understand that it is a black box and not a hole in the white background.\n\nAfter some processing, attention decides which information is important. For example, your brain sees every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but attention helps you not notice each one. Yet, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing happens in many stages, and attention helps decide what you notice at each stage.\n\nTo process information, the brain first needs to store it. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded or changed into a form the brain can keep. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies say that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is kept by an electrical signal in a loop of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory might be kept in the way certain proteins are structured.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. This means there are nodes for ideas, and these nodes are linked based on how they relate. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which then connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost jobs, house prices dropped, and large companies suffered. This problem still affects us today. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of bad political choices. These choices made banks give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also dealt with these loans. When people could not pay back, banks did not have enough money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular to win another term. He made it easier to get loans, which later caused the crisis. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and middle income and to keep making money.” Holmes warned this could cause trouble if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad loans led to the economy's fall.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new and complex way loans were made. Loans with changing rates and mortgage-backed securities connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made families and markets borrow too much and become at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market went bad, and financial institutions with these securities lost money. The top five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers closed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks with strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and came under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. This is the part of your story where you show your writing skills and amaze everyone with your words. Or it is the part where readers get bored and stop reading. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information.\n\nExposition is not helpful.\n\nMy readers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still writes long parts where nothing happens, or too much happens. Exposition makes you want to tell all the history before the interesting parts (not like the other side, which wants to tell every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, usually in simple words. In movies, exposition is when one character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author does the telling.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got married in a big way, and her husband was killed in front of her. You would not expect all this to take two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to show the husband's character by his words and actions, showing how much he loves his wife. You also expect the heroine to show in many ways how his life changed hers. This would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their deep bond, and clues about her thoughts and dreams. You would mourn his death with her and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more than just the simple story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more detail. Sometimes it is tempting to move quickly past certain things. Maybe you are introducing a new character. You know he used to be in the Air Force, now he manages a gas station at night, was married twice, no kids, likes fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and said he looked very bad. They spent about two minutes on this story because it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it might be because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed for years that stories about crime victims who are minorities do not get much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of coverage. But if it is a minority person, it may not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They told where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this story was short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark his skin was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug leader. He was found guilty of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noticed was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I am not sure why they said it that way, maybe to make it sound worse. They also said he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock. An ETF gives you diversity like an index fund. It also has benefits of a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. These benefits are good, and ETFs cost less than most mutual funds. But you must pay a commission when you trade ETFs, like with a stock. ETFs come in many types. Even with these benefits, smart investors should check if the benefits, like diversity, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to see if one ETF is as good as owning the 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to hold these stocks for good returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we will look at only the top 10 holdings. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percent of the total assets.\n\nWe will check how well these 10 stocks show the whole ETF IHF. We use their percent of assets, making it 100%, to find what each stock gives to a portfolio’s Beta and Return. If a portfolio was just these 10 stocks in their ETF amounts, we can see their Beta and return in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows a portfolio with only the top 10 holdings gives a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% better return. The Beta of the top 10 is 0.12 lower than the whole ETF. So far, a portfolio with the top 10 might give more return with less Beta. But they may not be very different. \n\nTo find if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We make it 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit sad, and it is not easy to know why it happened. When winter starts at a New England campus, fewer people come by bicycle or walking. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. Everyone is busy finishing schoolwork and grading. Many people might have forgotten to fill out the commuter log. December is also a busy holiday time, and students and teachers have a long break. Many do not need to come to campus then. Classes start again in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. But this does not explain the low number of logs in February. One might think that projects like this have a lot of energy at the start, which then falls. To stop this, we made the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March to bring back interest. It did increase log submissions for that month. So, one challenge was keeping the project going when people lost interest and during breaks in school.\n\nAnother challenge for this project is that people like the freedom and ease of driving cars. This is a big part of our culture. So, it is important to give reasons for using other ways to commute. We gave many prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have changed participation, like giving away a bicycle or a hybrid or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The prizes did not change much during the project. If the prizes got bigger over time, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had said in December that we would add a few bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, more people might have joined instead of losing interest.",
            "I looked at early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style and to see new features in some later ones. Most trick films from this time are filmed on a set. They are filmed from the front, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots. Each film is usually one shot. But, some films at the start of the 1900s use more than one shot.\n\nA common thing in trick films is filming on an indoor set. The camera does not move to follow people or things. This style comes from theatre, vaudeville, and magic shows. Because of the stage, people in the films mostly move side to side. They do not move closer to or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move side to side. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style means shots are usually long or medium. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees everything framed by the stage. Actors do not move close to the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films use one shot for the whole film. This makes most trick films about a minute long or less, based on frames per second. It also limits the story of these films. They focus on short tricks like magic or disappearing acts. But in a trick film, one shot in the viewer's eyes may be made of several shots. These are joined to show things like appearing or disappearing. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), look closely to see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though it seems like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Some people do not like the Gothic style, while others praise it. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make a new kind of story. Walpole uses old theatre ideas and new ways to show nature in his story. The Gothic style looks back at old theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used for many different things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style mixes old drama with new story forms, which lets readers see into the characters' minds. This mix helps the Gothic style stay around for a long time. It feels both old and new to readers today.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic stories is Chivalry. Chivalry is about training knights to be brave and good. This idea is in The Castle of Otranto. Writers like Walpole thought Chivalry was missing in their time. They used old chivalric manners to show a better past and make people think about improving the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tough political time. He worried about the future. He thought that people in his time were not as good as people in the past. This idea shows up in his characters, like Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, we learn he has many chivalric traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought dead. He is like a brave knight, which is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the making of the product and then to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, created the term supply chain management in 1982. He talked about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nMaking is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. This step shows when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can look at the market to find out. The market helps decide what customers want. After understanding what customers ask for, managers decide what to make and how much. They also decide where to make the products and which plant is best for amount and quality. They need to keep customer needs and happiness in mind. After choosing the place to make products, managers set work times and care for equipment. Making is very important in the supply chain. Every detail matters. If it is not planned well, it can cost the company time and money later. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have plans for everything, like how workers dress and how to get goods from trucks. Having plans helps a company work well without problems.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making good choices about what a facility can do and deciding on outside help based on these choices. A company might have many parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose which part fits best for the different jobs of the product. Management might also choose to have other companies do some work. They do this to move fast. Moving fast means giving good quality and being flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels focus on detail and the upper class. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are different. They use mystery and strange events. This makes the characters more interesting. It helps us understand their reasons and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen like a dream. These reveal Oliver’s deep feelings and what he knows. In one part, Oliver remembers being shot. He feels as if it is a dream. He cannot control what happens. He sees people like Sikes and Crackit in his mind. An unseen hand takes him away. He feels pain but also fear. Oliver cannot control his bad luck. This shows he feels he has no power, even in danger. It seems like Fagin is breaking him. Oliver might be losing hope and cannot react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, time feels strange. Day and night pass quickly and slowly. The silence is long and the hours are short.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in a program after school. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had many problems with reading. It seemed strange to me. Some letters he could say well. Others he could not. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few students while others went on a trip. Then his mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I spoke a little Spanish, but we could talk. I realized Adrian read fine. He just did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows the problem is not always clear. Even a child who speaks English well can have trouble reading it. Many agree this problem is real. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading English, the alphabet, and saying words. But for children who do not speak English well, the answer is not easy. We need to use many ways to help.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is good for all children, not just those who speak Spanish first. Children in two-way programs do better in school. Some fear it costs too much, or not all children will benefit. But that is not true. If we make these programs common, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers learn two languages? No, that is not easy or fair. But we can have helpers or tutors who speak two languages.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look within for answers. Many accept the religions of their parents. But some do not believe in them at all. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. People may change their beliefs over time. Whatever path we take, we try to understand ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. We listened to the rain on the tin roof and smoked our cigarettes. The rain came down hard, drowning the plants by the porch. He looked out at the rain, as if searching or remembering. He had become thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was less than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes. I felt alone and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation did not ease his pain, but kept him alive a few more months. I could not see the value in his longer suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him die. So I did not. I could not watch the life that created me end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than others did. Dad would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for his strong views on freedom and government. He believed in a farming system, and this belief shaped his thoughts on government. Taylor thought the United States could create a perfect system because there was no old tradition to stop them. He valued the natural rights of people and said if one right is denied, they all fail. These rights should be safe from government control. Taylor said in a natural state, strong and smart people win, but in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make an ideal society, Taylor thought the government must consider the good and bad in people. He had firm ideas about right and wrong. He said government actions must be human because people run it. He defined good rules as those that protect private property, help farming, and stop capitalism. He believed a government with good rules would be fair, even if leaders were selfish. He thought self-interest drove people, but it was bad when it hurt society. A good government was needed to control man's bad side and must be watched to avoid bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted a strict reading of the Constitution. He wanted a small Federal government with only the rights and powers clearly stated in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become controlling. But he also thought a simple reading was risky and could lead to problems without understanding the writers' intent. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide for the United States because it described the country as a group of separate states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, not thinking about what I saw. I quietly studied the view in front of me. My mind looked at the picture with no feelings. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts of my own. I just saw what was there.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book. The book was called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to put a square frame around a picture. This makes a complex picture, like fruit in a kitchen, easier to see. You just see the fruit.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl before me, I could not imagine this frame. I was amazed and could only stand and look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet liked green, and Italian artists used many colors. If I thought of myself as an artist, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my tool for art. My hand moved, and I thought this could be my most creative moment. Water moved smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My hand hit the toilet handle again, trying to flush away the brown mess in the toilet. It stayed stuck.\n\nWith a mop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the toilet. I flushed a few more times, thinking quietly. Then I reached for toilet paper and wrapped my hand like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, bent down, and put my hand into the bowl, like taking a turkey from the oven on Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons cause this problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that part of the problem is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents. It also causes more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens drive worse when they travel with friends. This is something everyone knows. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study about this. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They have temporary licenses that limit when teens can drive. These licenses also stop teens from driving with other minors as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers cannot handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even age 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today says Zuckerman has done research. It shows that people under age 19-20 like to take risks for excitement. It is better to delay driving until this risk-taking goes down. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, deadly accidents will continue. By 2010, many more teens will be ready to drive.\n\nLaws to address this issue could be simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education. But no one under age 18 could drive a car. A provisional permit could be given before a full driver’s license. Teens would still need to complete a certain number of driving practice hours. The number of hours could be like what most states require now. In California, teens need 6 hours of driving with a teacher and 50 hours with an adult. Because the problem is in all states, a national law could protect teens everywhere.\n\nThe law I suggest is not a new idea.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose CAPD, with common signs. At the end, it talks about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses information from hearing. It means the brain does not process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But the brain part that helps understand sounds, like words or talking in a noisy place, does not work right.\n\nThe disorder called CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” when researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made dichotic tests to study how the brain understands different sounds. In 1977, a national meeting helped more research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can show in different ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They might find it hard to tell apart different sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or detect changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound might block another sound. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts watch how a person listens and performs on hearing tests. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. They use different tools to check hearing-related skills. This includes questionnaires and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that always works well for diagnosing CAPD, and the cause is not known. Many tests give the person many sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, like words or numbers. More advanced tests record signals in the ear and measure how the ear responds.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are hurt or not cared for. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring values to social work. These values are service, respect, being honest, and helping people get along better. I also want to improve in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job to choose. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. I saw this happen, so I chose to study Psychology. I was still unsure about my career. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009 and took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He wanted to leave his abusive parents. The next day, the boy called the police about his parents. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police about my concerns. I told them I graduated in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents. The parents made excuses. They said their son was causing trouble. After this, I thought about becoming a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is important in social work. Society says the individual is important. We feel sad when we lose someone. But society wants us to be the same as others. I am an individual. I do not want to be like everyone else. In high school and college, I stood against social injustice. I did this in many ways. I colored my hair, wore clothes I liked, pierced my ears, and joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will keep fighting against injustice.",
            "This paper talks about the Biological and Sociocultural models related to insomnia. The biological model looks at genes and medical facts about health. The Sociocultural model examines how environment affects race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia explains these models and the studies chosen to help understand them. It also discusses the strong and weak points of these studies.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, related to another mental disorder, or due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories can come from medical problems or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia means trouble with sleep, and Primary Hypersomnia means trouble staying awake for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep (cataplexy) and automatic REM. Dyssomnias deal with trouble starting and keeping sleep, while Parasomnias are about unusual behaviors during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems related to another mental disorder are due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly talks about insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders looks at genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and being awake. A study with mice found GABAB receptors on these neurons affect sleep. Activating the GABAA receptor helps with sleep. If blocked, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that what happens in mice can apply to humans. It shows genes and environment affect the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could change sleep without medicine. The sociocultural side of this study is if this trait is inherited, it could affect sleep and, in turn, school, work, and daily tasks needing focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Many people, including me, find it hard to move around on campus. In my first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. This is almost the farthest east part of campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather is bad, which happens often in State College. An older alum told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and new health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another gets harder. What is the best way to fix this problem? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be built to meet bicyclists' needs.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after a few years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.” Biking is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is Pollock Road is the straightest way to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its good points, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only good option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 more minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours each week. Adding all the other walking time for classes and appointments would take more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from the start to seek happiness above everything else. The people are like pieces in a big game, following one idea given by the World Controller. If you look at the book with Marxist ideas, you see Huxley is worried about these systems. Words from Marxism like homogeny and reification show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of through the idea of false consciousness. This means normal people do not understand their real economic status. They only care about their own benefit. This happens because the ruling class controls the workers’ thoughts. In Brave New World, common people like Deltas and Gammas have no real choice. They learn to consume and spend through sleep teaching. The World Controller uses this control. Hegemony means one group rules over others, and this is clear in the story. Lower classes do not see the control. They believe in an idea that helps capitalism. Upper classes know more but do nothing; few like Bernard question their role. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships. The characters are not deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about women’s looks and women talk openly about their meetings. Each class is happy with their place, showing capitalism’s effect. They follow their role in society, which is like Marxist ideas about workers. They are made to think they are better as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. We often talked about if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is very important today. After 9/11, I saw media change from a hostile view of Islam to being more tolerant of Islam in America. In 2001, I do not think we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet interests me. I learned in the past that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography says Muhammad was misunderstood and humble. People then came to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. One is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men. The writers seem to want Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This writing makes it seem like they are taking ideas from Jesus and giving them to Muhammad.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that show how people became Muslims. But many stories come from third parties. The writer heard from someone who heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly man who was wise and gentle. But history shows a different side of Muhammad. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were left behind as Christian thought grew after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a trend toward progress. Some traditional people will not change their thinking, but they may not have enough influence. Among Christians, there will be more awareness of history. People will want to know what was added to Christianity after Jesus. It may take a long time, but there will be a change back to the original ideas. A movement will grow to remove added doctrines, like turning back time, until only Jesus' original ideas remain. This trend will spread in the United States and Europe, leading people to follow only Jesus' ideas. Churches will still be strong to guide. As beliefs become more uniform, there will be fewer differences between regions, denominations, and groups. History has many reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. Our country changed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. A future reversion will happen in the Christian religion, searching for the source and reducing diversity. This will be possible by reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not literal. \n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the start of Christian religion. Monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the Hebrew scriptures were core to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care about their own lives and do not care for those below them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The owners and managers of big factories only want to make their companies grow. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this. He says the buildings stand tall and black against the sky, with smoke rising high. This shows the damage from pollution. The owners do not care about the smoke or the waste from the pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers do not care about workers who make them rich. They want to save money. Sinclair says the place is full of jealousy and hate. There is no loyalty or decency. A man does not matter against a dollar. Workers must work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. At that time, there were few laws to protect workers.\n\nThis let managers and owners force workers to work faster in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but people living and working in Packingtown had to face these terrible conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions existed, but they often made things worse. Workers were treated badly and could not escape. They were like slaves. They were poor and depended on men as harsh as old slave drivers. Under these conditions, bad behavior was common, like under slavery.",
            "Dream-land is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this goes back to Virgil. Virgil talked about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use the word, but there is another source to consider. Poe liked German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, notes that their poems are similar. He thinks Poe copied Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for his drama Faust. Faust was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808. The second part came out in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries. He remembers his wife. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. But he keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both are about loss and drinking. Faust was made into a romantic drama in 1842 by H. P. Grattan. This was just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe talks about Thulé twice in his works. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thulé. He says it is dark and lonely. Dead friends haunt him. He sees a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king has lost his wife and feels lonely. He has no will to rule or live. The poem seems like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe would have known his work. Poe respected Tennyson, and there is a link to Goethe through Tennyson. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after the original.",
            "Under California law, if a person is hurt by slipping on applesauce in a store, they might get extra money as punishment for the store. This can happen if the manager knew about the spill and did nothing because he was having dinner. A judge might not dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money easily. To get this money, she must show the manager ignored the danger of the spill and acted badly. Palmer can say Martin should have known not cleaning the spill could harm people because other people were hurt in the store before her accident. Even if Martin’s actions do not seem very bad, it is still reasonable because six people fell in 2009 and he did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, a worker named Rich Wayne told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and could not handle it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer’s fall, five other people had fallen in the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for money for her injury and for punishment. We are thinking about trying to stop her claim for punishment money.\n\nIn California, a person can get punishment money if the other person acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Malice means trying to cause harm or acting very badly without caring for others’ safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the person knew their actions could be dangerous and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that could not be filled. This started when she was 14, just becoming a teenager. It was still there when she was 17. By then, she knew she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but no one caught her interest. She often asked herself why this happened. She thought about what could make a teenage girl feel this way. Over the years, she had ideas, but none seemed right. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and good people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she had a fun and lively personality. This made her very likable, and she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter went to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in a rushed voice. The daughter knew her mother was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she said. Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she had learned how to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital had the smell of cleaning and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice, as she was busy helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and called for help. Some worried faces gathered, and someone brought a rolling bed for her mother. They took her mother away to be looked at, while the daughter sat and worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study shows that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), with a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is linked to lower risk of long-term heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed form of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes plant proteins and uses monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat. Fish is part of the diet, with less animal products and saturated fats. Alcohol in small amounts is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet is linked to lower risk of death from all causes and heart problems. One study found the Med diet better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol in overweight people. Past studies did not focus on stroke.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63. These women had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which includes 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors looked at aMed diet scores using food reports given by the nurses. Reports were checked for accuracy. Health records or death certificates confirmed heart disease and stroke cases. If records were missing, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were in this group. Body weight, smoking habits, aspirin use, vitamin use, menopause status, and hormone use were noted. From 1986, physical exercise was also noted.\n\nTo show long-term eating patterns, average aMed scores from reports over two years were used. Changes were made for factors like age, smoking, body weight, menopause status, hormone use, vitamin use, alcohol use, exercise, and aspirin use.\n\nResearchers used a model to study the link between aMed scores and risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke separately.\n\nWomen who followed the Mediterranean diet more closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In 20 years, there were 2391 new heart disease cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke than those with the lowest scores. Their risk was 0.71 times that of women in the lowest group.",
            "The sign says Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strict military group. This group took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, people protested in the streets for the first time in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. The protests were called “The Saffron Revolution” because of the color of the monks' robes. At first, the government let the monks protest peacefully. But soon, violence broke out. The military attacked and damaged monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a protest. The government said 13 people were killed. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the bodies could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have always tried to stop protests and keep control. Long ago, Roman emperors said they were chosen by gods to rule everything. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were meant to lead their people to success. Our president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, who leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome famous examples of these actions include the protest at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Students, workers, and thinkers protested against the government. The number of dead people differs. The Chinese government said 200-300 people died. But the Chinese Red Cross said 2,000-3,000 people died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, helped by the Rwandan government, killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another example. During this time, people of Jewish background were killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington is famous in jazz for his long career and his skill in leading his band. He played piano quietly in many songs, but he was a great composer. Ellington wrote music that showed off the talents of his band members. He made music where soloists could play freely and wrote parts that fit the style of each musician. This made the whole band sound unique and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they fit together, which helped him create some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice as a jazz instrument. This song shows Ellington's skill in adding sound and color without words. It also shows how he worked with soloists. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet plays the melody with special blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high clarinet solo with a soft piano in the background.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with brass and reeds.\nChorus 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high pitch, with the brass and rhythm sections adding stops.\nChorus 6: Like the first chorus, with the voice using a \"growl\" sound as an instrument.\nTag: A short vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add sound color is a key part of his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington mixes tight band writing with sound color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox with scat singing create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas too. Here, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton plays the melody on trombone in a great way.",
            "Why do living things change over time the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, people have used math models to study how mollusks make their shells over time. Our study looks at how math models and experiments can help us understand changes in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers we could use to make models of their shells. These numbers went into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shells to see how much they can change. We combine these models with other studies to understand big changes in this group of animals.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls. They go around a line called the columella in the middle of the shell. Whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. The spire is all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds it. You can track the path of these openings using points for the center of each whorl's opening, and the size of the opening from side to side and top to bottom.\n\nYou can show this path on a graph and with math. Once you have a math formula, you can change how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. Indonesia is making progress on some goals like clean water and sanitation. But, child and mother health is not improving fast enough to meet the goals by 2015. The reasons for this will be explained below. The country needs to make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has improved the number of births with a skilled health worker. Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker. But this includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems in the pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, even though the numbers look better, more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five are getting treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea. The data on care after birth is not complete, but this is also a concern. The rates are low across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are about 4%, which is low. In cities, the rate is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare is more available in cities. There is also a big gap between rich and poor. The poor have a harder time getting healthcare because of high costs.\n\nTo improve care for mothers and newborns, we need to decide how to fix the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs, or make the whole health system better? Focusing on specific programs is attractive because it is easier to manage and gives quick results. But there are problems. Putting too much money into one area can take resources away from others. For example, more money for HIV/AIDS affects family planning. Also, running many separate programs can lead to extra paperwork and problems with organization.",
            "Popular Music has many types. Over the past 100 years, it has grown to include many different kinds. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has smaller types within it. Heavy Metal rock is one type. It has become very diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. It shows many emotions, though often they are dark. It is diverse because it can change a lot. People saw this early on and made their own new types. This led to even more smaller types, and it keeps growing.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is exactly. It includes many ideas from other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is more than just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement with a lot of darkness. It is \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more show. Less simple, more skill. People in metal bands are very good at playing music. Metal is also linked to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange music. These drugs were often blamed for this music. Metal has many dark, strong qualities. This was new because much popular music was not this dark. Later metal got ideas from dark things in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from that time show this darkness. \n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is up and down, like drugs. Some say it was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a reply to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark. The Beatles wanted to show they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "Before Surrealist artists made dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau was making his own dream art. He did this both in real life and in his mind. In 1910, Rousseau painted The Dream. This painting shows a woman amazed by the dream world she visits. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and hopes as an artist. Since he started painting, Rousseau wanted other artists and art lovers to notice and praise him. But he faced a hard choice. He had to decide if he should follow common art styles to be accepted or be different and create his own style.  \n\nTo understand The Dream, it helps to know about Rousseau's life. Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau did not learn art in school. Instead, he worked for the French toll service until he was forty. People wrongly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their children, Rousseau was left with one child, Julia, and much sadness. He wanted a new life and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was a folk painter who had the dreams of a common man.  \n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This makes sense because he did not have formal art training and started late. He painted at the same time as many famous artists. Though he worked for many years, people only noticed his art when Matisse became well-known. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that even though Matisse and Rousseau both painted, they were different. Matisse feared painting in a boring way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a traditional way to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested there is a connection between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a good reason for this. As John Keats writes in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We learn much in life through education or experience. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe rather than give rules. We try to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, instead of making rules for good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. A talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on foreground, background, contrast, or culture, but these do not explain why it is good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, “There's just something about it” before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe a work of literature, something beyond the words remains. I think ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This “something”, this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality. This special quality connects ethics and beauty.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we feel both deeply, even if we cannot explain them fully. This link is stronger in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today, Germany is a strong, united country. It has its own culture from München in the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. This culture is also in Köln on the Rhine River and in Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture is unique and comes from many sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is where the Germans come from. The name's origin is debated by experts. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, who were once called Germans. They crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He got this word from the Gauls to tell apart the Gauls he conquered from the tribes he did not. Some think it means a neighbor in the Gaulish language. Others think it comes from the spear called \"ger\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 about the Germans' origins. He said Germans were original and not mixed with other races. He wondered why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its wild lands and bad weather, unless it was home.\n\nRomans did not want to move to Germania. They explored it for goods and sometimes led campaigns there, but they mostly returned to Rome. By the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire's borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help someone trick others for a long time. But in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose who they really are. The problem with ending a trick is that it can make people feel alone. So, a person must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others will be upset and feel hurt by it.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be a different gender is especially difficult. It makes us ask why someone would hide their true identity. In Viola's case, she dresses as a man to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nViola is in a new land and thinks she must look like a man to be safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel separate from the women around her. This cuts her off from friends. Things become more complicated when Olivia falls in love with her because Olivia thinks she is a man: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has hidden feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern reader, Twelfth Night might show how pretending can reveal hidden feelings. This happens with Olivia and Orsino. Some parts of the play hint that they might have unspoken desires that Viola's disguise makes them face. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems likely that Olivia is making fun of people who only care about looks. This is clear when Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often harsh. This was clear in German South West Africa, now Namibia. There, the Germans killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But not all German colonies were the same. They had different rules and ways of leading. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also well regarded. South West Africa was different. There, the government did not set up many schools for local people. Instead, missionary groups ran most schools with little help from the government. The government spent more on schools for Europeans. These choices affected South West Africa for a long time. Most local people did not get an education and could not read or write. Many reasons led to these differences. This paper will explore these reasons and look at new studies on how settlers and leaders treated local Africans.\n\nThere are many writings about education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mostly describe schools in the colonies. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies. These studies showed big differences in colonial schools. Cohen wrote about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and explained why they were different. He said many settlers in South West Africa affected its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, unlike some other German colonies. Much of it was desert. Because of this climate, many Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In East Africa, another colony, there were only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico, taking Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other conflicts between these two countries until just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and other important matters.\n\nThis situation is similar to many countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. Countries that share a border often have conflicts. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher says that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries with long-lasting diplomatic problems with the United States. Both are close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues caused a problem between the United States and Mexico, as they have in many places throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 1800s, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy, much like they were against fascism and communism in the 1900s. The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was both about ideas and important interests. But in the case of the United States and Mexico, the struggle was about religion, not politics. This distrust came from past tensions between English and Spanish people. These feelings made it hard for the United States and Mexico to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about border issues and raids from Mexico. There were also problems with bandits and outlaws in American border towns. These issues continued until both countries used military force at their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. It finally ended when American goals changed from taking land to having economic influence in Mexico in the late 1800s.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick and disabled by an illness I did not know about before.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I needed safety and security. I did not have these when I was a child. People said, \"You will always find work; people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew older. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nBut then I was 46 years old, single, with no money and unable to work. Today, I am still disabled. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left to call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is hard. It hurts my sense of safety and self-worth. Nothing is certain. But I know one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and a few good friends. Even if I was strong, real problems can make you feel weak.\n\nEmergencies happen in life, both big and small. We cannot always be prepared. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nIn the U.S., we need to stop relying only on big government. It is not strong and is falling apart. Instead, I hope Americans learn to trust and help each other. It is better than each person building a shelter alone.\n\nSome talk about \"rugged individualism\" in the U.S. But what helped people in the past was kindness, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit: first aid supplies, water tablets, plastic for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned food. If you have land for a small farm and can preserve food, do it. It is a good idea, and so is a wood stove if you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he gave up the world and became wise. His teachings started a religion called Buddhism. The oldest group of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different today than when Buddha was alive. For example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people take part in this event. It is important to them, even though Buddha never talked about such a celebration. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and big ideas of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, both monks and regular people, had to change their beliefs over time. This is because of different forces, both from inside and outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nThere are some important ideas in this discussion. One idea is internal versus external. An internal force comes from members of the Buddhist community, whether they are monks or not. An external force comes from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force tries to harm the Buddhist community. A benign force does not try to help or hurt the community, but it might do one or the other by chance. These ideas will be used a lot in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the main ideas of the religion. Buddhists find safety in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts of Buddhist text, called the Tripitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for behavior. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep ideas of Buddhism. These ideas include Anatta, which means no soul; Dukkha, which means life is full of suffering; and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. With Sansara, desire, hatred, and wrong beliefs will also end when someone becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for life. Regular people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave sexually, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, being attached causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is very important in negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is and what it is not. Culture is not all the same, and it is not one thing. It is not simple or uniform. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too general. It is good to know about a culture, but it is better for a negotiator to know what culture means for the negotiation. It is important to understand how a culture's way of thinking can change talks. When you meet a new culture, you see it through your own culture, and you compare them.\n\nTo understand a different culture, you can study its history or learn about its views. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, accept it as it is. Work within its limits, especially in negotiation. This is very important if you are in a weak position. Also, if you are in a different place, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and help move talks forward.\n\nCulture is not only about nations. Companies in a country have their own culture too. A company might expect long work hours or have a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in uniforms, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies let workers help any charity. Others only allow company-approved charities. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company. This shows there is much diversity in a society's culture. Some cultures are not as divided as American culture, and may seem the same to outsiders. But this is a sign to look closer.\n\nValues are important to understand because they explain why a culture acts a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or boss to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values tough bargaining will not rush to settle early. It is important to think about these things before negotiation. Also, it helps if a negotiator learns about the other person to make talks more effective.",
            "The saying \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'\" comes from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It begins St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will discuss, seems to share this belief. Both argue for the same idea, so we will compare them to see whose argument is stronger. For now, let's assume both believe in the God of the Bible. Comparing their arguments about a different type of God would not work because they focus on one specific idea of God. I think both make good points, but neither gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, let's look at St. Anselm's basic argument. He says we understand God through faith, by looking inside ourselves. Anselm explains that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot think of him as not existing. This idea is a bit tricky, but it means that proof of God is in our own mind. According to St. Anselm, we do not need outside evidence to find truth about God. The existence of God is true by looking at what we know inside our minds. This idea of believing without solid evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God's existence through reason and evidence, without needing faith. This approach helps in spreading Christianity because it can attract new believers using only logic. St. Thomas uses five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, possibility, levels of goodness, and order. He shows that proof of God is in the logical need for God. Like if you know one puzzle piece is missing and you put together the rest, logic helps you know about the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually go together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he uses symbols to create meaning. He does this with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to colors, such as white/gray and red/pink, to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald uses white/gray to show sameness, with white being nicer and higher class, and gray being older and faded. He starts this in the beginning of the book by using these colors a lot. Daisy and Jordan are always “in white”—in fact, everyone is wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white.” The only time people do not wear white is when Nick sees Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.” Fitzgerald uses white and gray for many common things: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York,” the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” on Nick’s list, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray,” and the dog-seller is “a gray old man.”\n\nAfter Fitzgerald adds meaning to white/gray, he uses them to show unimportance or sameness. He first uses this with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers start to see Daisy as less of a character and more like something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses more of this around Daisy to give this feeling of her being a uniform addition, like the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,” and she is again in a “white” dress before Tom and Gatsby’s meeting.",
            "San Diego County is good for farming because of its mild, sunny weather. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a large market for organic farm products in the San Diego area. Many local groups have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms give tours of their farms. They also let people hike, watch birds, and do other fun activities. This can help the landowner get benefits from government programs. It also helps the habitat. This way, the land can be used for fun and farm tours. It can help make money or be used to teach people.\n\nOrganic farming can fill a special market. It often helps more plants and animals live in the area because there are no chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming in some ways. It needs more work and management to keep away pests and weeds and to fertilize the soil without chemicals. Losses are often greater than with regular methods. Small organic farms do not have the same efficiency as large ones. Other practices that help wildlife can also cost more work, like planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth. This can create special conditions like edge habitat or open ground. So, there are many reasons why the landowner might look for financial help or advice to make both profit and good habitat.\n\nThe land chosen in this example is next to the town of Potrero, in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres with chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It is in the East County Southern Foothills area of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, some butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers came in the late 1800s. This land was part of a homestead and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. I chose a piece of property from a real estate website. I looked into government programs to see what options a small farmer might have to lower costs and keep wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "There is a special link between brothers. This link cannot be broken. In this link are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other well. They often see themselves in each other. In hard times, the true nature of this link shows, whether good or bad. These feelings can cost a lot. To understand them, one must face what they bring. When a brother looks at his brother, he may see his own self. He sees himself as he truly is. Actions and their results show true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers look at this idea and the strong feelings that come with it. They travel through a vibrant world. They go on a journey that is doomed to fail. Sadness fights with pride in the end, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, Doodle, is described and their interactions. The narrator explains the complex feelings and how these affect the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions come from one feeling: pride. From when he and Doodle first go out, to their last trip, he feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach things like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother to “…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” These things are impossible because of Doodle’s weak heart. It is unlikely Doodle would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was hard for the young protagonist, whose dreams were quickly crushed. He even thought of hurting Doodle, though his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave him hope. It shows his deep love for his brother was there all along.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system that processes information. As technology has improved over time, the way we talk about the brain has also changed. Long ago, people compared the brain to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, later a book, and now to a computer. When learning about the brain, remember that these comparisons are not perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong ideas.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the senses. These senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals that the brain can understand. The brain processes this sensory information in different steps. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain first uses simple information like color and shape to recognize the box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, top-down processing helps you quickly understand that it is a black box and not a hole in the white background.\n\nAfter some processing, attention decides which information is important. For example, your brain sees every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but attention helps you not notice each one. Yet, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing happens in many stages, and attention helps decide what you notice at each stage.\n\nTo process information, the brain first needs to store it. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded or changed into a form the brain can keep. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, sound, or what they mean. After storing, information must be kept. Some studies say that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is kept by an electrical signal in a loop of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory might be kept in the way certain proteins are structured.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computer science, and others from how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. This means there are nodes for ideas, and these nodes are linked based on how they relate. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which then connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost jobs, house prices dropped, and large companies suffered. This problem still affects us today. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of bad political choices. These choices made banks give risky loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also dealt with these loans. When people could not pay back, banks did not have enough money. This affected the whole economy.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular to win another term. He made it easier to get loans, which later caused the crisis. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and middle income and to keep making money.” Holmes warned this could cause trouble if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad loans led to the economy's fall.\n\nMany things caused the crisis. One was the new and complex way loans were made. Loans with changing rates and mortgage-backed securities connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made families and markets borrow too much and become at risk if prices changed even a little.\n\nThe housing market went bad, and financial institutions with these securities lost money. The top five U.S. investment banks had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply, Lehman Brothers closed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks with strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and came under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. This is the part of your story where you show your writing skills and amaze everyone with your words. Or it is the part where readers get bored and stop reading. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information.\n\nExposition is not helpful.\n\nMy readers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still writes long parts where nothing happens, or too much happens. Exposition makes you want to tell all the history before the interesting parts (not like the other side, which wants to tell every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, usually in simple words. In movies, exposition is when one character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author does the telling.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got married in a big way, and her husband was killed in front of her. You would not expect all this to take two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to show the husband's character by his words and actions, showing how much he loves his wife. You also expect the heroine to show in many ways how his life changed hers. This would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their deep bond, and clues about her thoughts and dreams. You would mourn his death with her and feel closer to the heroine.\n\nIn short, you expect more than just the simple story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more detail. Sometimes it is tempting to move quickly past certain things. Maybe you are introducing a new character. You know he used to be in the Air Force, now he manages a gas station at night, was married twice, no kids, likes fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and said he looked very bad. They spent about two minutes on this story because it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet, and there were no suspects. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it might be because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed for years that stories about crime victims who are minorities do not get much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of coverage. But if it is a minority person, it may not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They told where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The time spent on this story was short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers watching.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark his skin was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug leader. He was found guilty of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noticed was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I am not sure why they said it that way, maybe to make it sound worse. They also said he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock. An ETF gives you diversity like an index fund. It also has benefits of a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. These benefits are good, and ETFs cost less than most mutual funds. But you must pay a commission when you trade ETFs, like with a stock. ETFs come in many types. Even with these benefits, smart investors should check if the benefits, like diversity, are real and how much they are. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to see if one ETF is as good as owning the 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to hold these stocks for good returns.\n\nTo study the ETF, we will look at only the top 10 holdings. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percent of the total assets.\n\nWe will check how well these 10 stocks show the whole ETF IHF. We use their percent of assets, making it 100%, to find what each stock gives to a portfolio’s Beta and Return. If a portfolio was just these 10 stocks in their ETF amounts, we can see their Beta and return in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows a portfolio with only the top 10 holdings gives a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% better return. The Beta of the top 10 is 0.12 lower than the whole ETF. So far, a portfolio with the top 10 might give more return with less Beta. But they may not be very different. \n\nTo find if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We make it 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit sad, and it is not easy to know why it happened. When winter starts at a New England campus, fewer people come by bicycle or walking. This might explain some of the drop. December is also the end of the fall semester. Everyone is busy finishing schoolwork and grading. Many people might have forgotten to fill out the commuter log. December is also a busy holiday time, and students and teachers have a long break. Many do not need to come to campus then. Classes start again in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. But this does not explain the low number of logs in February. One might think that projects like this have a lot of energy at the start, which then falls. To stop this, we made the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special campaign in March to bring back interest. It did increase log submissions for that month. So, one challenge was keeping the project going when people lost interest and during breaks in school.\n\nAnother challenge for this project is that people like the freedom and ease of driving cars. This is a big part of our culture. So, it is important to give reasons for using other ways to commute. We gave many prizes like gift cards to local places like restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have changed participation, like giving away a bicycle or a hybrid or electric car. This might have helped with the drop in interest. The prizes did not change much during the project. If the prizes got bigger over time, it might have helped. The gift cards were good at the start. But if we had said in December that we would add a few bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, more people might have joined instead of losing interest.",
            "I looked at early Edison films in the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style and to see new features in some later ones. Most trick films from this time are filmed on a set. They are filmed from the front, with no camera movement. They use long and medium shots. Each film is usually one shot. But, some films at the start of the 1900s use more than one shot.\n\nA common thing in trick films is filming on an indoor set. The camera does not move to follow people or things. This style comes from theatre, vaudeville, and magic shows. Because of the stage, people in the films mostly move side to side. They do not move closer to or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move side to side. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style means shots are usually long or medium. Close-up shots are never used in Edison trick films. This is like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience sees everything framed by the stage. Actors do not move close to the camera, so there are no close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films use one shot for the whole film. This makes most trick films about a minute long or less, based on frames per second. It also limits the story of these films. They focus on short tricks like magic or disappearing acts. But in a trick film, one shot in the viewer's eyes may be made of several shots. These are joined to show things like appearing or disappearing. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), look closely to see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though it seems like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt talks about this in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Some people do not like the Gothic style, while others praise it. The first \"Gothic Novel\" is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. It mixes old and new story ideas to make a new kind of story. Walpole uses old theatre ideas and new ways to show nature in his story. The Gothic style looks back at old theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used for many different things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style mixes old drama with new story forms, which lets readers see into the characters' minds. This mix helps the Gothic style stay around for a long time. It feels both old and new to readers today.\n\nOne big idea in Gothic stories is Chivalry. Chivalry is about training knights to be brave and good. This idea is in The Castle of Otranto. Writers like Walpole thought Chivalry was missing in their time. They used old chivalric manners to show a better past and make people think about improving the present. Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tough political time. He worried about the future. He thought that people in his time were not as good as people in the past. This idea shows up in his characters, like Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, we learn he has many chivalric traits. He is a prince who suffered and was thought dead. He is like a brave knight, which is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the making of the product and then to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, created the term supply chain management in 1982. He talked about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nMaking is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base for the whole process. This step shows when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can look at the market to find out. The market helps decide what customers want. After understanding what customers ask for, managers decide what to make and how much. They also decide where to make the products and which plant is best for amount and quality. They need to keep customer needs and happiness in mind. After choosing the place to make products, managers set work times and care for equipment. Making is very important in the supply chain. Every detail matters. If it is not planned well, it can cost the company time and money later. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have plans for everything, like how workers dress and how to get goods from trucks. Having plans helps a company work well without problems.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is supply. Supply means making good choices about what a facility can do and deciding on outside help based on these choices. A company might have many parts for making one product. Each part has different tools, workers, and skills. The manager must choose which part fits best for the different jobs of the product. Management might also choose to have other companies do some work. They do this to move fast. Moving fast means giving good quality and being flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels focus on detail and the upper class. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are different. They use mystery and strange events. This makes the characters more interesting. It helps us understand their reasons and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen like a dream. These reveal Oliver’s deep feelings and what he knows. In one part, Oliver remembers being shot. He feels as if it is a dream. He cannot control what happens. He sees people like Sikes and Crackit in his mind. An unseen hand takes him away. He feels pain but also fear. Oliver cannot control his bad luck. This shows he feels he has no power, even in danger. It seems like Fagin is breaking him.

            "A few years ago, I worked in a program after school. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had many problems with reading. It seemed strange to me. Some letters he could say well. Others he could not. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few students while others went on a trip. Then his mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I spoke a little Spanish, but we could talk. I realized Adrian read fine. He just did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools, especially in California. It shows the problem is not always clear. Even a child who speaks English well can have trouble reading it. Many agree this problem is real. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading English, the alphabet, and saying words. But for children who do not speak English well, the answer is not easy. We need to use many ways to help.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is good for all children, not just those who speak Spanish first. Children in two-way programs do better in school. Some fear it costs too much, or not all children will benefit. But that is not true. If we make these programs common, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we make all teachers learn two languages? No, that is not easy or fair. But we can have helpers or tutors who speak two languages.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others go to Temple or look within for answers. Many accept the religions of their parents. But some do not believe in them at all. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. People may change their beliefs over time. Whatever path we take, we try to understand ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. We listened to the rain on the tin roof and smoked our cigarettes. The rain came down hard, drowning the plants by the porch. He looked out at the rain, as if searching or remembering. He had become thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was less than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, not meeting my eyes. I felt alone and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. Speaking about it would make it too real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation did not ease his pain, but kept him alive a few more months. I could not see the value in his longer suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him die. So I did not. I could not watch the life that created me end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than others did. Dad would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for his strong views on freedom and government. He believed in a farming system, and this belief shaped his thoughts on government. Taylor thought the United States could create a perfect system because there was no old tradition to stop them. He valued the natural rights of people and said if one right is denied, they all fail. These rights should be safe from government control. Taylor said in a natural state, strong and smart people win, but in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo make an ideal society, Taylor thought the government must consider the good and bad in people. He had firm ideas about right and wrong. He said government actions must be human because people run it. He defined good rules as those that protect private property, help farming, and stop capitalism. He believed a government with good rules would be fair, even if leaders were selfish. He thought self-interest drove people, but it was bad when it hurt society. A good government was needed to control man's bad side and must be watched to avoid bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans then, wanted a strict reading of the Constitution. He wanted a small Federal government with only the rights and powers clearly stated in the Constitution. He knew a large Federal government cost a lot and could become controlling. But he also thought a simple reading was risky and could lead to problems without understanding the writers' intent. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide for the United States because it described the country as a group of separate states, not just one nation.",
            "I looked down, not thinking about what I saw. I quietly studied the view in front of me. My mind looked at the picture with no feelings. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts of my own. I just saw what was there.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book. The book was called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to put a square frame around a picture. This makes a complex picture, like fruit in a kitchen, easier to see. You just see the fruit.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl before me, I could not imagine this frame. I was amazed and could only stand and look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet liked green, and Italian artists used many colors. If I thought of myself as an artist, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nI touched my tool for art. My hand moved, and I thought this could be my most creative moment. Water moved smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My hand hit the toilet handle again, trying to flush away the brown mess in the toilet. It stayed stuck.\n\nWith a mop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie around my neck, I frowned at the mess left in the toilet. I flushed a few more times, thinking quietly. Then I reached for toilet paper and wrapped my hand like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, bent down, and put my hand into the bowl, like taking a turkey from the oven on Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many reasons cause this problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that part of the problem is that the teen brain is not ready for driving dangers. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents. It also causes more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens drive worse when they travel with friends. This is something everyone knows. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study about this. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make teen driving safer. They have temporary licenses that limit when teens can drive. These licenses also stop teens from driving with other minors as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers cannot handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks even age 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today says Zuckerman has done research. It shows that people under age 19-20 like to take risks for excitement. It is better to delay driving until this risk-taking goes down. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, deadly accidents will continue. By 2010, many more teens will be ready to drive.\n\nLaws to address this issue could be simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education. But no one under age 18 could drive a car. A provisional permit could be given before a full driver’s license. Teens would still need to complete a certain number of driving practice hours. The number of hours could be like what most states require now. In California, teens need 6 hours of driving with a teacher and 50 hours with an adult. Because the problem is in all states, a national law could protect teens everywhere.\n\nThe law I suggest is not a new idea.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short definition of the disorder. Next, it explains how to diagnose CAPD, with common signs. At the end, it talks about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the brain uses information from hearing. It means the brain does not process sounds correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But the brain part that helps understand sounds, like words or talking in a noisy place, does not work right.\n\nThe disorder called CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” when researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made dichotic tests to study how the brain understands different sounds. In 1977, a national meeting helped more research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can show in different ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They might find it hard to tell apart different sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or detect changes in speech, like sarcasm. One sound might block another sound. They may not understand sound clues well or know the order of sounds they hear.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts watch how a person listens and performs on hearing tests. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. They use different tools to check hearing-related skills. This includes questionnaires and watching how the person reacts to sounds. There is no single test that always works well for diagnosing CAPD, and the cause is not known. Many tests give the person many sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, like words or numbers. More advanced tests record signals in the ear and measure how the ear responds.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are hurt or not cared for. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring values to social work. These values are service, respect, being honest, and helping people get along better. I also want to improve in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job to choose. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. I saw this happen, so I chose to study Psychology. I was still unsure about my career. I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009 and took a break. One day, I visited a friend. She introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy. He wanted to leave his abusive parents. The next day, the boy called the police about his parents. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police about my concerns. I told them I graduated in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents. The parents made excuses. They said their son was causing trouble. After this, I thought about becoming a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is important in social work. Society says the individual is important. We feel sad when we lose someone. But society wants us to be the same as others. I am an individual. I do not want to be like everyone else. In high school and college, I stood against social injustice. I did this in many ways. I colored my hair, wore clothes I liked, pierced my ears, and joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will keep fighting against injustice.",
            "This paper talks about the Biological and Sociocultural models related to insomnia. The biological model looks at genes and medical facts about health. The Sociocultural model examines how environment affects race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia explains these models and the studies chosen to help understand them. It also discusses the strong and weak points of these studies.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, related to another mental disorder, or due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories can come from medical problems or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia means trouble with sleep, and Primary Hypersomnia means trouble staying awake for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves sudden sleep (cataplexy) and automatic REM. Dyssomnias deal with trouble starting and keeping sleep, while Parasomnias are about unusual behaviors during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep problems related to another mental disorder are due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly talks about insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders looks at genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and being awake. A study with mice found GABAB receptors on these neurons affect sleep. Activating the GABAA receptor helps with sleep. If blocked, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that what happens in mice can apply to humans. It shows genes and environment affect the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could change sleep without medicine. The sociocultural side of this study is if this trait is inherited, it could affect sleep and, in turn, school, work, and daily tasks needing focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Many people, including me, find it hard to move around on campus. In my first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. This is almost the farthest east part of campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather is bad, which happens often in State College. An older alum told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the Creamery and new health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another gets harder. What is the best way to fix this problem? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But just having bikes is not enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be built to meet bicyclists' needs.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after a few years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.” Biking is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best choice I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is Pollock Road is the straightest way to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its good points, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only good option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 more minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours each week. Adding all the other walking time for classes and appointments would take more time than I have.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They learn from the start to seek happiness above everything else. The people are like pieces in a big game, following one idea given by the World Controller. If you look at the book with Marxist ideas, you see Huxley is worried about these systems. Words from Marxism like homogeny and reification show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of through the idea of false consciousness. This means normal people do not understand their real economic status. They only care about their own benefit. This happens because the ruling class controls the workers’ thoughts. In Brave New World, common people like Deltas and Gammas have no real choice. They learn to consume and spend through sleep teaching. The World Controller uses this control. Hegemony means one group rules over others, and this is clear in the story. Lower classes do not see the control. They believe in an idea that helps capitalism. Upper classes know more but do nothing; few like Bernard question their role. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships. The characters are not deep, even the main ones. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist. People talk about women’s looks and women talk openly about their meetings. Each class is happy with their place, showing capitalism’s effect. They follow their role in society, which is like Marxist ideas about workers. They are made to think they are better as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. We often talked about if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is very important today. After 9/11, I saw media change from a hostile view of Islam to being more tolerant of Islam in America. In 2001, I do not think we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet interests me. I learned in the past that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography says Muhammad was misunderstood and humble. People then came to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. One is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men. The writers seem to want Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This writing makes it seem like they are taking ideas from Jesus and giving them to Muhammad.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that show how people became Muslims. But many stories come from third parties. The writer heard from someone who heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly man who was wise and gentle. But history shows a different side of Muhammad. I wonder if Muslims today know the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were left behind as Christian thought grew after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is a growing awareness and a trend toward progress. Some traditional people will not change their thinking, but they may not have enough influence. Among Christians, there will be more awareness of history. People will want to know what was added to Christianity after Jesus. It may take a long time, but there will be a change back to the original ideas. A movement will grow to remove added doctrines, like turning back time, until only Jesus' original ideas remain. This trend will spread in the United States and Europe, leading people to follow only Jesus' ideas. Churches will still be strong to guide. As beliefs become more uniform, there will be fewer differences between regions, denominations, and groups. History has many reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. Our country changed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. A future reversion will happen in the Christian religion, searching for the source and reducing diversity. This will be possible by reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not literal. \n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the start of Christian religion. Monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the Hebrew scriptures were core to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care about their own lives and do not care for those below them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The owners and managers of big factories only want to make their companies grow. They do not care about anyone who gets hurt in the process. Upton Sinclair writes about this. He says the buildings stand tall and black against the sky, with smoke rising high. This shows the damage from pollution. The owners do not care about the smoke or the waste from the pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers do not care about workers who make them rich. They want to save money. Sinclair says the place is full of jealousy and hate. There is no loyalty or decency. A man does not matter against a dollar. Workers must work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. At that time, there were few laws to protect workers.\n\nThis let managers and owners force workers to work faster in bad conditions. The book does not say it directly, but people living and working in Packingtown had to face these terrible conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions existed, but they often made things worse. Workers were treated badly and could not escape. They were like slaves. They were poor and depended on men as harsh as old slave drivers. Under these conditions, bad behavior was common, like under slavery.",
            "Dream-land is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this goes back to Virgil. Virgil talked about an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the known world. Virgil did use the word, but there is another source to consider. Poe liked German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, notes that their poems are similar. He thinks Poe copied Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for his drama Faust. Faust was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808. The second part came out in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries. He remembers his wife. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. But he keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both are about loss and drinking. Faust was made into a romantic drama in 1842 by H. P. Grattan. This was just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe talks about Thulé twice in his works. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses it twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thulé. He says it is dark and lonely. Dead friends haunt him. He sees a world without color. These scenes are like \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe. The king has lost his wife and feels lonely. He has no will to rule or live. The poem seems like the speaker is inside Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe would have known his work. Poe respected Tennyson, and there is a link to Goethe through Tennyson. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many copies made after the original.",
            "Under California law, if a person is hurt by slipping on applesauce in a store, they might get extra money as punishment for the store. This can happen if the manager knew about the spill and did nothing because he was having dinner. A judge might not dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money easily. To get this money, she must show the manager ignored the danger of the spill and acted badly. Palmer can say Martin should have known not cleaning the spill could harm people because other people were hurt in the store before her accident. Even if Martin’s actions do not seem very bad, it is still reasonable because six people fell in 2009 and he did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, a worker named Rich Wayne told his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and could not handle it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer’s fall, five other people had fallen in the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for money for her injury and for punishment. We are thinking about trying to stop her claim for punishment money.\n\nIn California, a person can get punishment money if the other person acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Malice means trying to cause harm or acting very badly without caring for others’ safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the person knew their actions could be dangerous and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "She always felt like she needed something. It was a desire that could not be filled. This started when she was 14, just becoming a teenager. It was still there when she was 17. By then, she knew she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her over, but no one caught her interest. She often asked herself why this happened. She thought about what could make a teenage girl feel this way. Over the years, she had ideas, but none seemed right. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and good people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with her. The only thing they argued about was her need for independence and freedom. She was the daughter of a calm couple, but she had a fun and lively personality. This made her very likable, and she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, looking for new ideas, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter went to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in a rushed voice. The daughter knew her mother was in great pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she said. Her mother pointed, and the daughter was glad she had learned how to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital had the smell of cleaning and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice, as she was busy helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and called for help. Some worried faces gathered, and someone brought a rolling bed for her mother. They took her mother away to be looked at, while the daughter sat and worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study shows that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), with a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is linked to lower risk of long-term heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed form of the Med diet. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes plant proteins and uses monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat. Fish is part of the diet, with less animal products and saturated fats. Alcohol in small amounts is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that following a Med diet is linked to lower risk of death from all causes and heart problems. One study found the Med diet better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol in overweight people. Past studies did not focus on stroke.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63. These women had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which includes 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors looked at aMed diet scores using food reports given by the nurses. Reports were checked for accuracy. Health records or death certificates confirmed heart disease and stroke cases. If records were missing, cases were called \"probable\" and included. About 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks were in this group. Body weight, smoking habits, aspirin use, vitamin use, menopause status, and hormone use were noted. From 1986, physical exercise was also noted.\n\nTo show long-term eating patterns, average aMed scores from reports over two years were used. Changes were made for factors like age, smoking, body weight, menopause status, hormone use, vitamin use, alcohol use, exercise, and aspirin use.\n\nResearchers used a model to study the link between aMed scores and risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke separately.\n\nWomen who followed the Mediterranean diet more closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In 20 years, there were 2391 new heart disease cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke than those with the lowest scores. Their risk was 0.71 times that of women in the lowest group.",
            "The sign says Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strict military group. This group took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, people protested in the streets for the first time in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. The protests were called “The Saffron Revolution” because of the color of the monks' robes. At first, the government let the monks protest peacefully. But soon, violence broke out. The military attacked and damaged monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a protest. The government said 13 people were killed. But Colonel Hla Win, who left the army before the report, said many more people died. He said the bodies could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have always tried to stop protests and keep control. Long ago, Roman emperors said they were chosen by gods to rule everything. Japanese emperors were thought to be gods. They were meant to lead their people to success. Our president, George W. Bush, talks weekly with Ted Haggard, who leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide, which is part of the Republic Party.\n\nSome famous examples of these actions include the protest at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Students, workers, and thinkers protested against the government. The number of dead people differs. The Chinese government said 200-300 people died. But the Chinese Red Cross said 2,000-3,000 people died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, helped by the Rwandan government, killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another example. During this time, people of Jewish background were killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington is famous in jazz for his long career and his skill in leading his band. He played piano quietly in many songs, but he was a great composer. Ellington wrote music that showed off the talents of his band members. He made music where soloists could play freely and wrote parts that fit the style of each musician. This made the whole band sound unique and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they fit together, which helped him create some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice as a jazz instrument. This song shows Ellington's skill in adding sound and color without words. It also shows how he worked with soloists. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds. The voice starts smooth and ends rough.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet plays the melody with special blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high clarinet solo with a soft piano in the background.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with brass and reeds.\nChorus 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high pitch, with the brass and rhythm sections adding stops.\nChorus 6: Like the first chorus, with the voice using a \"growl\" sound as an instrument.\nTag: A short vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add sound color is a key part of his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington mixes tight band writing with sound color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox with scat singing create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas too. Here, Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton plays the melody on trombone in a great way.",
            "Why do living things change over time the way they do? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This is still true today. Recently, people have used math models to study how mollusks make their shells over time. Our study looks at how math models and experiments can help us understand changes in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers we could use to make models of their shells. These numbers went into a computer program called CerioShell. We made models of shells to see how much they can change. We combine these models with other studies to understand big changes in this group of animals.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around over time. These turns are called whorls. They go around a line called the columella in the middle of the shell. Whorls can get bigger at different speeds. A line called a suture separates each whorl. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl. The spire is all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different sides: the top, bottom, front, and back. Usually, people look at shells from the front, with the opening facing them and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top. Find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds it. You can track the path of these openings using points for the center of each whorl's opening, and the size of the opening from side to side and top to bottom.\n\nYou can show this path on a graph and with math. Once you have a math formula, you can change how the mollusk makes its shell.",
            "The number of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. Indonesia is making progress on some goals like clean water and sanitation. But, child and mother health is not improving fast enough to meet the goals by 2015. The reasons for this will be explained below. The country needs to make the health system stronger instead of just focusing on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has improved the number of births with a skilled health worker. Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker. But this includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems in the pregnancy. This is why many mothers die from bleeding. So, even though the numbers look better, more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five are getting treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea. The data on care after birth is not complete, but this is also a concern. The rates are low across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are about 4%, which is low. In cities, the rate is 7%, but in rural areas, it is only 2%. This shows that healthcare is more available in cities. There is also a big gap between rich and poor. The poor have a harder time getting healthcare because of high costs.\n\nTo improve care for mothers and newborns, we need to decide how to fix the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs, or make the whole health system better? Focusing on specific programs is attractive because it is easier to manage and gives quick results. But there are problems. Putting too much money into one area can take resources away from others. For example, more money for HIV/AIDS affects family planning. Also, running many separate programs can lead to extra paperwork and problems with organization.",
            "Popular Music has many types. Over the past 100 years, it has grown to include many different kinds. It is hard to list them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has smaller types within it. Heavy Metal rock is one type. It has become very diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. It shows many emotions, though often they are dark. It is diverse because it can change a lot. People saw this early on and made their own new types. This led to even more smaller types, and it keeps growing.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is exactly. It includes many ideas from other types of music. But, it started somewhere. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is more than just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement with a lot of darkness. It is \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more show. Less simple, more skill. People in metal bands are very good at playing music. Metal is also linked to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used drugs, which led to wild, strange music. These drugs were often blamed for this music. Metal has many dark, strong qualities. This was new because much popular music was not this dark. Later metal got ideas from dark things in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from that time show this darkness. \n\nThe song \"Helter Skelter\" shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is up and down, like drugs. Some say it was one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a reply to a Rolling Stones song that was also dark. The Beatles wanted to show they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "Before Surrealist artists made dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau was making his own dream art. He did this both in real life and in his mind. In 1910, Rousseau painted The Dream. This painting shows a woman amazed by the dream world she visits. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and hopes as an artist. Since he started painting, Rousseau wanted other artists and art lovers to notice and praise him. But he faced a hard choice. He had to decide if he should follow common art styles to be accepted or be different and create his own style.  \n\nTo understand The Dream, it helps to know about Rousseau's life. Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau did not learn art in school. Instead, he worked for the French toll service until he was forty. People wrongly called him a customs inspector. After his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their children, Rousseau was left with one child, Julia, and much sadness. He wanted a new life and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was a folk painter who had the dreams of a common man.  \n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. This makes sense because he did not have formal art training and started late. He painted at the same time as many famous artists. Though he worked for many years, people only noticed his art when Matisse became well-known. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that even though Matisse and Rousseau both painted, they were different. Matisse feared painting in a boring way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a traditional way to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested there is a connection between ethics and beauty, between truth and beauty. I think there is a good reason for this. As John Keats writes in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We learn much in life through education or experience. Yet, we seem to understand ethics and beauty, as Keats says, without being taught in the usual ways. Ethics and beauty try to describe rather than give rules. We try to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, instead of making rules for good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. A talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on foreground, background, contrast, or culture, but these do not explain why it is good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, “There's just something about it” before giving a deeper explanation. I think art and morals cannot be fully described by their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe a work of literature, something beyond the words remains. I think ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This “something”, this special quality, is the strongest part of art and morality. This special quality connects ethics and beauty.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we feel both deeply, even if we cannot explain them fully. This link is stronger in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today, Germany is a strong, united country. It has its own culture from München in the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. This culture is also in Köln on the Rhine River and in Dresden on the Elbe River. Germany's culture is unique and comes from many sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is where the Germans come from. The name's origin is debated by experts. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, who were once called Germans. They crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He got this word from the Gauls to tell apart the Gauls he conquered from the tribes he did not. Some think it means a neighbor in the Gaulish language. Others think it comes from the spear called \"ger\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout.\"\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 about the Germans' origins. He said Germans were original and not mixed with other races. He wondered why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its wild lands and bad weather, unless it was home.\n\nRomans did not want to move to Germania. They explored it for goods and sometimes led campaigns there, but they mostly returned to Rome. By the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire's borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help someone trick others for a long time. But in the end, a person must stop pretending. If not, they might lose who they really are. The problem with ending a trick is that it can make people feel alone. So, a person must choose between being true to themselves or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others will be upset and feel hurt by it.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be a different gender is especially difficult. It makes us ask why someone would hide their true identity. In Viola's case, she dresses as a man to protect herself: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nViola is in a new land and thinks she must look like a man to be safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel separate from the women around her. This cuts her off from friends. Things become more complicated when Olivia falls in love with her because Olivia thinks she is a man: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has hidden feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern reader, Twelfth Night might show how pretending can reveal hidden feelings. This happens with Olivia and Orsino. Some parts of the play hint that they might have unspoken desires that Viola's disguise makes them face. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems likely that Olivia is making fun of people who only care about looks. This is clear when Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in Africa was often harsh. This was clear in German South West Africa, now Namibia. There, the Germans killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But not all German colonies were the same. They had different rules and ways of leading. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also well regarded. South West Africa was different. There, the government did not set up many schools for local people. Instead, missionary groups ran most schools with little help from the government. The government spent more on schools for Europeans. These choices affected South West Africa for a long time. Most local people did not get an education and could not read or write. Many reasons led to these differences. This paper will explore these reasons and look at new studies on how settlers and leaders treated local Africans.\n\nThere are many writings about education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mostly describe schools in the colonies. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies. These studies showed big differences in colonial schools. Cohen wrote about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and explained why they were different. He said many settlers in South West Africa affected its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, unlike some other German colonies. Much of it was desert. Because of this climate, many Europeans lived there. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In East Africa, another colony, there were only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. During this war, the United States attacked and won against Mexico, taking Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other conflicts between these two countries until just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and other important matters.\n\nThis situation is similar to many countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. Countries that share a border often have conflicts. These conflicts can lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher says that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries with long-lasting diplomatic problems with the United States. Both are close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American countries have had good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues caused a problem between the United States and Mexico, as they have in many places throughout history. Sally Frahm says that in the 1800s, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy, much like they were against fascism and communism in the 1900s. The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was both about ideas and important interests. But in the case of the United States and Mexico, the struggle was about religion, not politics. This distrust came from past tensions between English and Spanish people. These feelings made it hard for the United States and Mexico to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about border issues and raids from Mexico. There were also problems with bandits and outlaws in American border towns. These issues continued until both countries used military force at their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. It finally ended when American goals changed from taking land to having economic influence in Mexico in the late 1800s.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick and disabled by an illness I did not know about before.\n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this job because I needed safety and security. I did not have these when I was a child. People said, \"You will always find work; people will always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew older. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nBut then I was 46 years old, single, with no money and unable to work. Today, I am still disabled. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left to call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is hard. It hurts my sense of safety and self-worth. Nothing is certain. But I know one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and a few good friends. Even if I was strong, real problems can make you feel weak.\n\nEmergencies happen in life, both big and small. We cannot always be prepared. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nIn the U.S., we need to stop relying only on big government. It is not strong and is falling apart. Instead, I hope Americans learn to trust and help each other. It is better than each person building a shelter alone.\n\nSome talk about \"rugged individualism\" in the U.S. But what helped people in the past was kindness, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit: first aid supplies, water tablets, plastic for windows, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned food. If you have land for a small farm and can preserve food, do it. It is a good idea, and so is a wood stove if you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be known as Buddha. During his life, he gave up the world and became wise. His teachings started a religion called Buddhism. The oldest group of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different today than when Buddha was alive. For example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people take part in this event. It is important to them, even though Buddha never talked about such a celebration. These changes can be seen in both small traditions and big ideas of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group, both monks and regular people, had to change their beliefs over time. This is because of different forces, both from inside and outside, and both friendly and unfriendly.\n\nThere are some important ideas in this discussion. One idea is internal versus external. An internal force comes from members of the Buddhist community, whether they are monks or not. An external force comes from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force tries to harm the Buddhist community. A benign force does not try to help or hurt the community, but it might do one or the other by chance. These ideas will be used a lot in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the main ideas of the religion. Buddhists find safety in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts of Buddhist text, called the Tripitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for behavior. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep ideas of Buddhism. These ideas include Anatta, which means no soul; Dukkha, which means life is full of suffering; and Anicca, which means everything changes. By understanding these ideas, one can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. With Sansara, desire, hatred, and wrong beliefs will also end when someone becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka gives rules for life. Regular people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave sexually, and do not use drugs. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, being attached causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped."
