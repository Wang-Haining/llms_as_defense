            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture can be known by what it is not, as well as by what it is. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing. It is not all the same. Saying “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are agreeable” is too simple. It is good to know what a culture is like, but it is better to know how that culture affects talks between people. When a person meets a foreign culture, they see it in a way that makes sense with their own culture. They compare the two.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture can mean learning its history or knowing its prejudices. Instead of trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work with it, especially in talks where one has less power. If a person is in a different place, respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in talks.\n\nCulture is not just about different countries. Companies in the same country have their own culture. A company might want people to work long hours, or it might have a relaxed schedule. Company culture shows in how people dress, talk, and hire. Some companies allow all workers to help charities, others limit it to certain causes. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures are less divided and might look the same from the outside, but it is important to look deeper.\n\nValues are also important because they explain why a culture acts in a certain way. If keeping respect or working together is important, a person will not shame their company or boss to win a negotiation. Someone from a culture that likes tough deals may not rush to settle talks. It is important to think about these things before talks. A negotiator should also learn about the person they are negotiating with to make talks better.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This line is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It is also the start of St. Anselm's idea about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another person we will talk about, Thomas Aquinas. Since both argue for the same idea, and we need to decide who argues better, we will start by assuming that both are right about the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. If we think about a different kind of God, we cannot compare their arguments well. So, while both make good points, neither fully gives a strong reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we will look at St. Anselm's main idea. Anselm talks about finding understanding through faith. He says we find proof of God inside ourselves. He explains that because God is in our understanding, we cannot think that God does not exist. This idea can be hard to follow, but basically, proof of God is in our own minds. St. Anselm says we do not need outside proof. The truth about God is in what we know to be true inside us. This idea of accepting something without strong proof is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis idea is different from what St. Thomas Aquinas believes. Aquinas says that we can prove God's existence with reason and evidence, without faith. This would help in spreading Christianity because new people could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas talks about five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, chance, levels of good, and order. In each, he shows that God must exist because it is logical. Like when you know a puzzle has a missing piece, you can know what it looks like without seeing it just by using logic.",
            "Writers often use different ways to give readers a feeling or attitude about important subjects. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually fit, like an adjective and a noun, to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it to create this feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds meaning for colors like white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is nicer and higher class, while gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Everyone wears white: Nick has \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" People are not wearing white when Nick sees Gatsby’s party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" to work, names at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" on Nick’s list, and Catherine’s apartment is one \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—showing sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter building meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show unimportance or sameness in things. This starts with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers see Daisy as less of a character and more of something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique to show Daisy as a uniform addition, like the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in \"white\" before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours and allow hiking, birdwatching, and other fun activities. This helps landowners get the benefits of government programs, improve habitat, and make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming can bring more plants and animals because it does not use chemicals in soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to manage pests, weeds, and soil without chemicals. Small organic farms do not have the same benefits as big farms. Other practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and managing plant growth, also need more work. Landowners might need financial help or expert advice to make the most profit and improve habitat quality.\n\nThe land is next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which protects many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, might soon be endangered.\n\nNative Americans lived here for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers settled here in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood production.\n\nI found a property on a real estate website and researched government programs to help small farmers reduce costs and protect wildlife.

            "There is a strong bond between brothers. It cannot be broken. This bond has many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. When they look at each other, they see themselves. In difficult times, this bond shows its true nature, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a big cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother sees himself in his brother’s eyes, he sees his true self. Their true character is shown in their actions and the results of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this bond and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a richly described land. Their journey is hard and ends in sadness. In the end, only one brother survives. The story shows this theme through the main character, Doodle, and his brother's actions and thoughts. The narrator’s view shows the complex feelings of the main character and his view of the world, which affect his actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions are driven by one feeling: pride. From the first time he and Doodle go out together to their last trip, the main character feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach how to hold his breath, run, jump, or climb vines. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with in the pine tree behind the barn. This was not possible because Doodle was born with a weak heart. It was unlikely he would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was tough for the main character, whose dreams were crushed. He even felt anger towards Doodle and thought about hurting him. But when Doodle smiled, his heart softened. This simple act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology became more advanced, the way we talk about the brain changed too. First, people said the brain was like a wax tablet. Then, they said it was like a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a computer. These comparisons can be helpful, but they can also lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation processing starts with input from the senses. The senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals the brain can understand. The brain processes this information in different ways. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at simple things like color and shape to figure out it is a box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, the brain uses this information to quickly recognize the box. This is called top-down processing. Top-down processing can also help you see that it is a black box and not a hole.\n\nAfter processing, the brain decides which information is important. This is done by an attention filter. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the blades, but you do not notice each one. However, if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it. Attention affects how we process information at many stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must be stored first. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, which means it is changed into a form the brain can store. For example, words can be encoded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. Working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds. It is thought that this is done by signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory might be kept by special protein structures.\n\nThere are many ideas about how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computers, and others on how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are nodes for concepts, and they are linked by how related they are. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden.\"",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a big financial crisis. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market fell apart. Many large and important companies in America were in trouble. This problem still affects us today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of poor political choices. These choices pushed banks to give risky loans. The financial system was not strong enough to handle these loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also pressured to work with these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks did not have enough money to cover the losses. This caused problems for the economy.\n\nThe crisis began in 1999 during President Clinton's time. He wanted to stay popular to win another term. The Clinton team made it easier for people to get loans. This set the stage for the crisis that came seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this. He said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.” Holmes also warned that this could cause problems if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad lending decisions led to the economy's downfall.\n\nMany things caused the economy to fail. One was the new and complicated way loans were handled. Adjustable-rate loans and other complex financial products were common before the crisis. These made the housing market connect deeply with the economy. Many households and financial markets put too much into housing. They became very weak to small price changes.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held these risky loans suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply. Lehman Brothers fell apart. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with more rules. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion in mortgage debt. The government took control of them in September 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the background. It can be interesting or boring. Some readers may stop reading if there is too much information. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information in a story.\n\nExposition can be a problem.\n\nMany writers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin sometimes writes long parts with too much information. Exposition is the little voice that tells you to explain everything before getting to the good parts. It is not the same as the voice that wants you to tell every detail about a character's past.\n\nExposition is when you tell the audience what happened. In movies, it is when a character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author tells the story.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told the main character met her love somewhere, they got married, and her husband was killed in front of her. This might take up two pages, with little talking. But you would expect more. You would want to see how much the husband loves his wife, and how the heroine's life changed because of him. This would help you feel for the husband and understand the heroine better. You would be sad when he dies, and you would feel closer to the heroine.\n\nYou want more detail than just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details. Sometimes, it is easy to skip over things. You might introduce a new character and know he was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and ate Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story as it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and had been arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. There were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it was because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed that when minorities are victims of a crime, they are not given much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of attention. But if a minority person is a victim, it might not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They gave details about where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was short, but they wanted to keep it as a \"teaser\" so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I found it curious that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I do not know if they thought that sounded harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. Yet, it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the mix of different investments like an index fund. It also offers benefits of owning a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as few as one share. These benefits are appealing. The cost of ETFs is lower than that of mutual funds. But, there are some drawbacks. You must pay a fee on any trade with ETFs, just like with stocks. Another good thing about ETFs is the many different funds you can choose from. It is important for a smart investor to check if the benefits like diversification truly exist. We will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a mix of the ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to group these stocks for a higher return. \n\nTo study the ETF, we will not use every stock it holds. We will only use the top ten stocks. These make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 stocks and their share of total assets.\n\nTo find out how well these ten stocks show what the ETF IHF is like, we can use the current % of assets, adjusted to 100%. We calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio had only these 10 stocks in the same share as the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we see that the return of a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in return. The Beta of the top ten stocks is .12 lower than the ETF. The results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the averages of these two portfolios are not very different from each other.\n\nTo find out if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We adjust them to 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Look at Figure 17. In the third month of the project, there was a big drop in commuter log submissions. This was sad, and we do not know why it happened. Winter starts on the New England campus, and fewer people walk or bike. This could be why fewer logs were submitted. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget about the commuter log. December also has the holiday season, and students and teachers have a long break. They do not come to campus much. Classes start again in late January. This could explain the low number of logs then. But it does not explain the low number in February. At first, a project can have a lot of energy and excitement. This may go down over time. To fix this, we had Carpool Challenge Week in March. This increased log submissions. We learned it is hard to keep up interest in a project because of natural decrease and holiday breaks in schools.\n\nAnother challenge is people like driving cars. It gives freedom and independence. It is part of our culture. We need to give reasons to choose other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift certificates to local places and some big stores. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle or a hybrid car would help. This might stop the drop in interest. The prizes did not change during the project. If prizes got better over time, it might help. Gift cards were good at first. But if we added bicycles in December and a car in January, maybe more people would join.",
            "I looked through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them. These films used clever editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style. I also looked at some films that had different features. Most trick films at that time were made on a set. They were filmed like a stage play. The camera did not move. The shots were long or medium. Each film was usually one shot. But some films at the start of the twentieth century used more than one shot.\n\nMost trick films shared the same style. They were filmed indoors on a stage. The camera stayed in one place. This style came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. In these films, people moved side to side. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors came in from the right and moved back and forth. Even when they left the frame, the camera did not follow.\n\nThe style of shooting meant the shots were mostly long. Sometimes they were medium. Close-up shots were not used. This was like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience saw the whole stage. In early films, actors stayed in the middle. Close-ups did not happen.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one shot was one film. This made them short, about a minute long. The trick films did not tell long stories. They showed short tricks like magic or making things disappear. But one shot in the viewer's eyes was not really one physical shot. It could be made of several shots joined to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It seems like one shot, but you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic style. Some say it lacks depth, while others admire its \"terrible sublime\" quality (Burke). The first \"Gothic Novel\" was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole used ideas from both old and new romances to create a new kind of story. He mixed old theater elements with new details from nature. This created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre includes past elements from medieval theater, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was already used to describe different peoples, styles, and times. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style combines the old drama with the new novel format. This lets readers see the characters' thoughts more clearly. This mix helps Gothic stories stay interesting, even for readers today.  \nOne main idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. This medieval idea is about training knights to be brave and good. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows a classic knight's bravery and honor. Writers like Walpole felt that society lacked these traits. By using chivalry, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized. It is used to try to make the present better. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was worried about politics and the future. He may have thought that the goodness of people from the gothic past was lost in his time. This idea is seen in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, readers learn he has many chivalric traits.  \n\nFrederic is described with many traditional knightly images. He is a prince, has faced tragedy, and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, leading to the Gothic theme of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods. It starts with a customer order. Then it goes through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained that it is about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction comes first in supply chain management. It is the base for the whole process. Production looks at when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can learn this by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need. After studying the market, managers decide what to make and how many. They also decide where to make the products. They choose the best place for making a lot and for good quality. They must keep customer needs in mind. \n\nAfter choosing the place for making products, managers plan work schedules and keep machines in good shape. Production is very important. Every detail is vital. If not planned well, it can cost the company time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have a plan for everything, like how workers should dress and how to get shipments from trucks. These plans help the company run smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making decisions on a facility’s main skills and partnerships. A company can have different parts for making one product. Each part has its own tools, workers, and skills. The manager decides which part is best for each process. Management might also hire other companies to help. They do this to work faster. This means giving good service and being flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often have many details and focus on the upper class of the time. Two novels that are called Victorian but are different are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These books use mystery and strange events, which are not common in other books from that time. This makes the characters stronger and shows more about what they feel and why they do things.\n\nHere is a part from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, many confusing ideas came into his mind. He seemed to walk between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. He heard their words. When he paid attention, he found he was talking to them. Suddenly, he was shocked by the sound of guns. There were loud cries, lights flashed, and all was loud and chaotic, as some unseen hand took him quickly away. Through all these quick visions, he felt a pain that tired and bothered him all the time.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange events often show what Oliver feels inside, what hurts him, and what he understands about the things happening around him. In chapter 28, when the shooting is talked about again, Oliver remembers it like a dream, while he looks for help. The part shows that Oliver had no control over what happened and how bad his health had become. He sees Sikes and Crackit in his mind. The shooting takes over his senses, and he does not notice the “unseen hand” that takes him away. He feels his sadness again, without the shock of pain, as the pain is now always there and connected with fear. Since Oliver is overwhelmed, it makes you wonder who caused his trouble, because it was not him. This shows that Oliver cannot control events, even when his life is in danger. It also suggests that Oliver feels more defeated, like old Fagin is starting to break him and make him accept this sadness, affecting how he reacts. Otherwise, we might think that Oliver would try to do something, at least to save his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its silence and short in its few hours.”",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had trouble reading. I noticed something unusual. He could say some letters well, but not others. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke English perfectly. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few kids while others were on a field trip. Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we talked. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope this helped him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools. This is common in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even children who speak English well can have trouble reading. We all know this problem is real. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more help with English reading, letters, and sounds. But for other children who do not speak much English, it is harder. There is no single answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, regular classes, private tutors, and ESL classes. We should combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Studies show that children in bilingual programs do better in school. Some people fear it wastes resources and does not help most students. But that is wrong. If we use these programs for all, every child will benefit. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No. That is not practical. But we can have special helpers or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are young, many of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some learn about it in Sunday school or Temple. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religion of their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they know. We might choose one belief and then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoked together. The rain filled the gutters and soaked the plants. He looked into the rain, half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over months, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was thinner too. He looked into the rain and avoided my eyes. I felt alone and scared. I could not tell him I would miss him because it would make it real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and looked into the rain with him.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain. It only kept him alive a few more months. I did not know the value of this when he only suffered longer. I wondered what kind of God would do this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, I thought, he stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him pass from this life. So I did not. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than others did, and I knew he would not want me to watch his death. I stayed in bed for three days and waited for news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for strong opinions about personal freedom and government. He believed in a farming system. This idea was the base of his thoughts on government. He wanted to protect and support what he saw as the best job. This belief shaped his views on who should have power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could build a perfect system. There were no old customs to stop the new government. This allowed for self-rule. He believed in natural rights for all people. He said these rights are linked. If one right is lost, all rights lose value. These rights should not be taken by the government. He said in a \"state of nature,\" strong and clever people win. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor believed a good society needs a government. This government should understand the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong ideas about right and wrong. He said government, run by people, will have human virtues and faults. He said good rules protect private property, help farming, and limit capitalism. A government with good rules will be fair, even if leaders are greedy. He thought self-interest drives people. It is bad when it harms others. A good government keeps man's bad side in check. But it must be watched to stop bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be strictly followed. He wanted a small Federal government. It should only have powers clearly given in the Constitution. He thought a big Federal government costs a lot and could become oppressive. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution is risky. Without knowing what the writers meant, it could lead to problems. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide of the United States. It shows the country as states with their own powers, not one single nation.",
            "I looked down. My mind tried to understand what I saw. I did not feel anything. I watched closely but did not connect my thoughts to any deeper ideas. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts, just a flow of seeing. \n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about drawing and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to use a square frame around a picture. This makes a big picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easy to see as just the bowl of fruit. \n\nAt that moment, I was looking at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist's frame in my mind. I was too amazed to do anything but look. Artists like Picasso, Monet, and those from the Italian Renaissance had their styles. If I wanted to call my view Art, then this was the start of my work, my story—Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my tool. My hand moved as I wished, ready to create. Water spun around, clear and smooth. Bits of stuff floated away. My hand moved quickly again, hitting the toilet handle. The brown thing stayed, stuck at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nI held a mop and stood with my feet apart. My green tie felt tight around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the mess someone left in the Rite Aid bathroom. After a few more flushes and quiet moments, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent down. My hand went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a turkey.",
            "Young people are dying in car crashes. Many reasons cause this problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents, car rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. They often do this. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens. They have rules for temporary licenses. These rules limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other young people as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, are not ready to handle driving risks. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says even 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman’s research shows young people like to take risks for excitement. So, it might be better to wait until this thrill-seeking is less strong. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly crashes. Many young people will be driving by 2010.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be simple. Schools can offer driving classes, but no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could be given before a full license, and some practice hours would be needed. The number of hours could be like those in most states. For example, in California, it is now 6 hours of training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since the bad statistics for teen drivers are similar in all states, a national law would help protect teens everywhere.\n\nThis idea for a law is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short meaning of the disorder. Next, it explains how to know if someone has it, with common signs to watch for. Finally, the paper ends with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the central nervous system uses what we hear. It means the brain cannot process sounds right. People with CAPD can hear fine, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But, the part of the brain that understands what we hear does not work as it should.\n\nThe first time people talked about this disorder was in the mid-1950s. It was called \"auditory imperception\" then. Researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to understand how the brain works with hearing. In 1977, a big meeting helped start more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show in many ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble telling the difference between sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or changes in speech. One sound might block another. They may not understand sound clues or the order of sounds.\n\nTo know if someone has CAPD, they must be checked by watching how they listen and respond. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test that works for everyone, and no known cause for CAPD. Tests may include asking people to tell apart different sounds and recording responses to signals in the ear.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who have been hurt or ignored. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring these values to social work: service, respect, ethics, and commitment. I want to help people improve their relationships and become better in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job I wanted. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of what I saw, I chose to study Psychology. But I still did not know what job to choose. So, after I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One summer day, I met a friend. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy. He was nervous. She said he was there to get away from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the police to his parents’ home. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and told them about my degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak to the parents. The law could not help the boy. I talked to the parents. They seemed nervous. They made excuses and said their son was lying. After this, I thought more about a job in social work. I want to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say each person is important, but we still want everyone to be the same. I think it is better to be different. In high school and college, I stood against social injustice. I dyed my hair different colors. I wore clothes that showed who I am. I pierced my ears more than usual. I joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought against racism and discrimination when I saw it. I believe in social justice. I will keep fighting against social injustice.",
            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model studies genes that are passed down and medical parts of health. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment relates to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia talks about these models and explains each study chosen to help understand the models. The research findings are then examined to show their strong and weak points.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, a disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a disorder linked to other problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are linked to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a problem with getting or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake, both for at least one month. Narcolepsy includes cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and staying asleep, while Parasomnias are related to unusual behaviors or physical happenings during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep problems due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice showed that there are GABAB receptors on these neurons that control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor helps sleep. If this receptor is stopped from working, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from mice can apply to humans. This shows a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep well without medicine. The sociocultural meaning of this study is that if the trait was inherited, it could affect sleep. Changing the receptor would disturb sleep, which would negatively affect areas like school, work, and daily activities that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Moving around campus is a problem for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in a dorm room at East Halls, which is very far east on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which happens often in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, who said that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another becomes harder. What is the best way to solve this problem? On a college campus, the answer is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made for bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after not doing so for many years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.\" Biking is good for your body and it is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms. The best thing I did this year was to buy a bike. I have class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road is the quickest way to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel on, even with a bike. Walking has its good points too, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s more than two and a half hours each week. Add all the other time I would spend walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I can afford.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They are taught to seek quick happiness above all else. The people are controlled by a bigger plan set by the World Controller. When we look at this book with Marxist ideas, we see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism like \"false consciousness\" show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of with the idea of false consciousness from Marxism. Regular people do not understand their real class relations because they only care about their own gain. This is because of control over workers, shown in how people are taught in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, have no real will. They are taught to buy and spend through sleep-teaching. The World Controller uses this to control them. Groups are controlled by other groups. Lower classes do not know they are controlled and support the system of capitalism and consumerism. Higher classes know but do little about it. Only some, like Bernard, question their place. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships. Characters are not deep, even main ones. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do strong feelings. Interactions are shallow, with men talking about women’s looks and women talking about their encounters. Each class is happy with their place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in society shows Marxist ideas about workers who think they are better as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One main topic in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. This question is even more important today. Since 9/11, I have seen the media change. At first, it showed Islam as hostile. Now, it is very tolerant of Islam in America. I think, in 2001, we could not have a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me. What I know about Muhammad's history seems different from the biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography shows Muhammad as misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they saw truth in his teaching.\n\nThere are similarities between Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. For example, Muhammad took mutton and milk and made it enough for forty men. This writing style makes me think the writers wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This is hard for me because it makes Jesus's life and miracles seem less important. It feels like they take credit for Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography try to show how people converted to Islam. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true and more suspicious to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly, humble, and gentle man. But history shows something else. I wonder if Muslims today know about the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought developed after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is more awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people hold on to old beliefs and resist change, but they may not be enough to affect everyone. Among Christians, knowledge of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what was added to Christianity and what Jesus really wanted. This change may take a long time, but it will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will grow, removing added ideas, and going back to what Jesus taught. As this change happens in the United States and Europe, people will worship like in Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will stay strong to lead. But, beliefs and practices will become more alike instead of different. Over time, there have been big changes in history. For example, Christians were once hurt by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became Christian. In our country, we have moved from slavery to leadership for African-Americans. The big change coming will be in the Christian religion, going back to its source, and becoming less diverse. This change will happen by reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, not literal. So what happened since Jesus’ time? If we look back in history, we find only Judaism, which started Christianity. Belief in one God, a revealed religion, and Hebrew scriptures were all important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that, deep down, people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care only about themselves and making their lives better. They do not care about people lower than them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The main example is the owners and managers of big factories. They want to make their companies as big and great as possible. They do not care who or what gets hurt in their way. \n\nUpton Sinclair describes the pollution from the factories. He writes about big chimneys and smoke going into the sky. Sinclair wants to show the damage from this pollution. He shows that the owners do not care about people or animals who might get hurt. They do not care about the smoke coming from the factories or the waste from the animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They do anything to save or make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" \n\nWorkers have to work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. During the time of \"The Jungle,\" there were few laws to protect workers. Managers and owners could do what they wanted. Workers had to work fast and in bad conditions. The book shows that workers had to deal with these bad conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions were formed, but they often hurt more than they helped because they took money from poor workers. \n\nWorkers were treated so badly that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" This shows that workers had no escape from the system. They were always close to starvation and depended on cruel men.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word goes back to Virgil. Virgil used \"Thule\" to mean an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this was the edge of the known world. But there is a more recent link to this word. Poe liked German writers. This is important because it shows Poe knew about Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote about Poe and Goethe. He said Poe's poem was like Goethe's work. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust. It was published in two parts, in 1808 and 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses her. He decides to die, gives his things to his children, but keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, and dies. The King of Thule and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are a lot alike. It might show Poe's own feelings of loss.\n\nPoe uses the word \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He first uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as similar works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. The speaker sees dead friends and a world without color. In Goethe's poem, the king is also lonely after losing his wife. It feels like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe likely knew of him. Poe also respected Tennyson. This connection to Tennyson would have led Poe to Goethe’s work. Goethe's work was reproduced many times after it first came out. This is how Poe might have known it.",
            "In California, can a customer who slipped on an applesauce spill in a store get extra money as punishment for the store? The customer must show the manager acted with bad intent. The manager knew about the spill twice but did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge may not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer's request for extra money. To get this money, Palmer must show the manager's actions were done with a willful disregard for harm. She must also show the actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin, the manager, should have known not cleaning the spill was dangerous. Many people had already slipped in the store in the months before Palmer's accident. Even with this knowledge, Martin did not clean the spill. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong. But it is still possible because six slip-and-fall accidents happened in 2009, and Martin did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and did not want to deal with it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for money to cover her injury and extra money for punishment. We are thinking about asking the court to reject the request for extra money.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money for punishment if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone intended to cause harm or acted very badly and ignored others' safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the defendant knew the actions were dangerous and still did it. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt like she needed something. This desire could not be satisfied. It started when she was 14, just starting her teenage years. It was still there 3 years later, when she was 17. By now, she thought she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her heart, but no one interested her. She often asked herself about this strange feeling, trying to find out why she felt this way. She had some ideas, but nothing clear. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually calm. Her parents were good and quiet people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with their daughter. They only argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she had a lively and fun personality. This made her well-liked because she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, trying to find inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter ran to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were rushed and tight, and the daughter knew she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Her mother showed her hands, and the daughter was glad she had learned to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nAt the hospital, there were smells of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice that, because she was too busy helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother in and called for help. Some worried people came, and someone brought a rolling bed and laid her mother down. They took her to be checked right away, and the daughter sat and waited with worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aims to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes eating more plant foods, such as plant proteins, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes eating more monounsaturated fat (not saturated fat) and fish, and eating less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in small amounts is okay.\n\nEarlier studies found that following a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of death from heart disease. One study showed that the Med diet helped people lose weight better than a low-fat diet. It also lowered the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Past studies did not focus on stroke or deaths from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which included 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake in the past year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were marked \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use after menopause were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, physical activity during free time was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random differences for a person and better show long-term diet intake, averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use after menopause, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using different models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher aMed diet score was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The unsettling message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is controlled by a harsh military group that took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests, the first in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. People called it “The Saffron Revolution,” named for the color of the monks' robes. At first, more people showed interest in the protests. The Burmese government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon the situation became violent. Some saw it as a war between the monks and the military. Soldiers invaded and destroyed monasteries. Foreign reporters were arrested and jailed. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, while at a street protest. The official number of deaths is 13. But an army officer, Colonel Hla Win, who left the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to stop protests and keep complete control for a long time. Roman emperors said they were chosen by the gods to rule. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to lead their people. Our current president, George W. Bush, talks every week with Ted Haggard, leader of a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the government. The death count varies. The Chinese government says 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, with help from the Rwandan government, killed many Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. During that time, many Jewish people were rounded up and killed.",
            "Duke Ellington is important in jazz because he lived a long time and was very creative. He was good at leading his band. On the piano, Ellington was often subtle, but he was great at writing music. He made complex pieces that showed the skills of his band members. Ellington let soloists improvise, and he also wrote pieces that used the special style of his band members. This made the band sound unique and original. He knew how each player sounded and how they fit together in the band. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice like a jazz instrument. This was an early example of using voice to add color without words. In Creole Love Call, Ellington showed he could match the style of his soloists. This piece is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\n1. First part: Voice and reeds call and respond. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\n2. Second part: Muted trumpet plays the melody with blue notes.\n3. Third part: Clarinet solo in high notes, with a soft piano behind it.\n4. Fourth part: The full band echoes the first part with brass and reeds.\n5. Fifth part: The reeds call and respond in high notes, with brass and rhythm backing.\n6. Sixth part: Like the first part, voice and reeds call and respond. The voice uses the “growl” technique.\n\nEnd: A quick vocal run and a strange trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add a new sound. This is a style he used often. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington mixed tight writing with tone color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing made a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas more. Ellington used Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that shape how they change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that scientists had hardly begun to describe simple living forms using math, and this is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusk shells form over time (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study looks at how math models and experiments can show how and why these changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help model shell shapes. These numbers were put into a program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We made models of shell shapes to see what changes are possible in Prunum. These results are mixed with studies to learn more about big changes over time in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that moves through space. The turns of the shell are called whorls, and they spiral around a central line called the columella. The size of whorls can change, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one. The spire is all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from the top, bottom, front, and back. Normally, a shell is viewed from the front, with the opening facing the viewer and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, and estimate to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of these openings by using the center, and the size of each opening.\n\nThis path can be shown in pictures and math. Once you have a math model, you can change the numbers to see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in reaching some goals, like clean water and toilets. But, it is not doing well in making sure mothers and children are healthier. There are many reasons why this is happening. We need to make the health system stronger instead of only making new programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress with more babies being born with a trained health worker present. Now, 72% of births have a health worker there. But, this number also includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there is a problem during birth. This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding. So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems, and more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea see a health worker now. We do not have all the information about care for mothers after birth, but it is a concern too, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of Cesarean sections are still low, around 4%. There is a problem because 7% of these happen in cities but only 2% happen in rural areas. This shows that healthcare services are mainly in cities. Another problem is that poor people use health services much less than rich people. There is a 27% gap between the poorest and richest groups. The poor find it hard to get healthcare, likely because they have to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nTo make care for mothers and babies better, we need to think about the best way to fix the problem. Should Indonesia make programs just for this issue, or should it make the whole health system better? Making programs for one specific area can seem like a good idea. These programs have clear goals and can show results faster. But there are problems too. Spending a lot on one program can mean less money for other programs. People may leave other areas to work where there is more money, like happened with funding for HIV/AIDS affecting family planning. Also, having many programs for the same thing can mean repeated work and uncoordinated services, leading to more forms and paperwork.",
            "Popular music has changed a lot in the past 100 years. There are now many types of music. It is hard to name them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups within it. Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most varied and expressive types in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often darker ones. It is diverse because people saw it could change. They made new styles from it. This led to even more new styles.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is now. It has mixed with other types of music. But, like all things, it started from something. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement known for its dark side. It is a \"music of more\"—more bass, more noise, more intensity, more drama. Metal band members are skilled with their instruments, and it shows. Metal is also known for its link to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used psychedelic drugs. This led them to make strange and intense music. Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new because much popular music was not dark. Later metal bands took ideas from the Romantic Era. The lyrics show the darkness that is key to metal.\n\nHelter Skelter by The Beatles shows this dark side. It has ups and downs, like a drug experience. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show they could be as heavy as The Rolling Stones. They put it on The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists painted dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau made his own dream paintings. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman amazed by the dream world she sees. This painting also shows Rousseau's dreams and hopes as a painter. From the start, he wanted other artists and art lovers to accept and praise him. He faced a hard choice to reach this goal. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: should he copy popular art styles to fit in, or be unique and follow his own way?\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau had no formal art training. He worked for France in a toll service job until age forty. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His first wife, Clémence, died after losing eight babies, leaving him with one daughter, Julia. Full of sadness, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and new hope. Unlike others who romanticized peasant life, he was a folk painter with simple hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He had no formal training and started painting late. He also painted at the same time as famous artists. He got recognition only when Matisse was becoming known. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared being boring, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would get him into Artiste Français.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong link between what is good and what is beautiful, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. In a poem, John Keats says, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful, as Keats suggests, without being taught in these usual ways. Both ideas try to explain rather than tell us what to do. Our study of what is right and what is beautiful is mostly about why a piece of art or writing is good, or why an action is right, rather than rules for making good art or doing good things.\n\nAlso, talking about art or morals can never completely show what is truly good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss things like the front, the back, how colors are used, or the culture it comes from. But these do not fully explain why it is good art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art or book, they say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed answer. I think art and morals can never be fully explained by their parts. As Flannery O'Connor says, a story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way. Even if we describe all parts of a book, there is still something more. I think the same is true for what is right. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something,\" this hard-to-explain quality, is the strongest part of both art and what is right. This makes a link between the two.\n\nI think art and what is right are closely connected because we feel both deeply, even if we can't fully explain them. This link is even stronger in literature. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature is important because of the values we find in it, just like in life.",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a unique culture from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also felt in Köln, on the river Rhine, through the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Germany's culture comes from many different sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is called Germania. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars. He took the word from the Gauls to tell them apart from the tribes he had not conquered. Some think it meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. Caesar wrote about the Germans beyond the Rhine, who often fought the Gauls. Others say the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or from an Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" showing Germans as loud.\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the Germans in AD 98. He believed they were native to their land and not mixed with others. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its harsh land and weather, unless it was their home.\n\nRomans did not want to live in Germania. They sent expeditions for goods and fought sometimes, but they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire’s borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while wearing a disguise can help deceive others for a long time, a person must eventually stop pretending. Otherwise, they might lose who they really are. Ending a deception is hard because it can make a person feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others may get upset and feel hurt by the deception.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be the opposite gender is difficult. One important question is why someone would hide their true identity this way. For Viola, it is a form of protection. She says: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Viola is in a strange place and thinks she must pretend to be a man to stay safe from danger. Her plan works, but it also cuts her off from the women who could support her. Also, she looks so much like a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Olivia says, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has to deal with hidden feelings between her and Orsino, who says: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo today’s readers, Twelfth Night may show how deception can reveal hidden feelings, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters might have feelings they do not fully understand until Viola/Cesario makes them face these emotions. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems she does not, as Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in its colonies was often very harsh. This was clear in the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But, not all of the German colonial empire was the same. Each colony had different ways of ruling and teaching. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also praised by writers of that time.\n\nIn South West Africa, it was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government started schools for Africans, education in South West Africa was mostly left to missions with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on education for Europeans there, building state schools and helping mission schools more. This led to long-term effects. While many Africans in other German colonies could read and write, most in South West Africa could not. Many reasons led to this difference. This paper will look at these reasons and focus on new studies about settler and government views on Africans.\n\nThere are many writings on education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mainly showed what the school systems were like. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies and looked at details. These showed big differences in education between colonies. The most important study on this topic is by Cohen. Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared the school systems and explained why they were different. Cohen said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa was a key reason for its unique education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a better climate than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was more than the 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States attacked and defeated Mexico. The United States gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other clashes between the two countries. The rivalry slowed down just before the First World War. It began because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and material interests.  \n\nThis is similar to many countries that have a rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have clashes of interests. This can create rival positions between them. The United States and Mexico are like many other rivalries between countries that share a common border. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both of these countries are close to the United States. They have been rivals, while other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.  \n\nReligious issues caused a split between the two countries. This problem has affected many countries through history. Sally Frahm says that in the twentieth century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, there was an ideological struggle. But this struggle was about religious preferences, not political structure. The distrust came from the distrust between the English and Spanish. This feeling of distrust was a big obstacle in creating friendly relations between the United States and Mexico.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues and border raids from Mexico. There were also problems with outlaws from American border towns. This was a major problem until both countries used military force on their borders.  \n\nSchmitt explains that the rivalry began to slow down as Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States. It ended when American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I never knew about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this work because I needed safety and security. I did not have these as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, at 46 years old, I was single and had no money. I could not work. I am still disabled today. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing that is mine. I get by, but every day is hard. My life is not sure anymore. But one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and friends. Even strong people need help in hard times. \n\nLife will always have emergencies. There are no guarantees. No matter how prepared you are, some problems are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that people in the U.S. should not depend only on big government. It is not steady. But I think we should trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help. We should not just build shelters alone. \n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But what helped our ancestors was compassion, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone. \n\nSo, be ready. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water tablets, and plastic sheets. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned foods. If you can grow and preserve your food, do it. It is a good idea. A wood stove is also good if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. One day, he would be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became wise. His teachings started Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It is different now than when Buddha was alive. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country. There, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and other people take part in it. This ceremony has some religious meaning, even though Buddha did not talk about such events. These changes are seen in both the simple traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group has changed its ideas over time. This is because of forces from both inside and outside, and some are good while others are not.\n\nThere are some terms we will use often. There is \"internal\" versus \"external.\" An internal force comes from members of the Buddhasasana, whether they are monks or not. An external force is from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or wants to harm Buddhists. A benign force does not want to hurt or help Buddhists, but it might do one of these by accident. We will talk about these terms often.\n\nFirst, let us look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which means three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has deep ideas like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes). By knowing these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth. When Sansara ends, so do lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life. For laymen, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in sex, and do not take drugs or alcohol. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture can be known by what it is not, as well as by what it is. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing. It is not all the same. Saying “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are agreeable” is too simple. It is good to know what a culture is like, but it is better to know how that culture affects talks between people. When a person meets a foreign culture, they see it in a way that makes sense with their own culture. They compare the two.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture can mean learning its history or knowing its prejudices. Instead of trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work with it, especially in talks where one has less power. If a person is in a different place, respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in talks.\n\nCulture is not just about different countries. Companies in the same country have their own culture. A company might want people to work long hours, or it might have a relaxed schedule. Company culture shows in how people dress, talk, and hire. Some companies allow all workers to help charities, others limit it to certain causes. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures are less divided and might look the same from the outside, but it is important to look deeper.\n\nValues are also important because they explain why a culture acts in a certain way. If keeping respect or working together is important, a person will not shame their company or boss to win a negotiation. Someone from a culture that likes tough deals may not rush to settle talks. It is important to think about these things before talks. A negotiator should also learn about the person they are negotiating with to make talks better.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This line is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It is also the start of St. Anselm's idea about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another person we will talk about, Thomas Aquinas. Since both argue for the same idea, and we need to decide who argues better, we will start by assuming that both are right about the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. If we think about a different kind of God, we cannot compare their arguments well. So, while both make good points, neither fully gives a strong reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we will look at St. Anselm's main idea. Anselm talks about finding understanding through faith. He says we find proof of God inside ourselves. He explains that because God is in our understanding, we cannot think that God does not exist. This idea can be hard to follow, but basically, proof of God is in our own minds. St. Anselm says we do not need outside proof. The truth about God is in what we know to be true inside us. This idea of accepting something without strong proof is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis idea is different from what St. Thomas Aquinas believes. Aquinas says that we can prove God's existence with reason and evidence, without faith. This would help in spreading Christianity because new people could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas talks about five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, chance, levels of good, and order. In each, he shows that God must exist because it is logical. Like when you know a puzzle has a missing piece, you can know what it looks like without seeing it just by using logic.",
            "Writers often use different ways to give readers a feeling or attitude about important subjects. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually fit, like an adjective and a noun, to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it to create this feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds meaning for colors like white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is nicer and higher class, while gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Everyone wears white: Nick has \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" People are not wearing white when Nick sees Gatsby’s party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" to work, names at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" on Nick’s list, and Catherine’s apartment is one \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—showing sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter building meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show unimportance or sameness in things. This starts with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers see Daisy as less of a character and more of something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique to show Daisy as a uniform addition, like the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in \"white\" before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours and allow hiking, birdwatching, and other fun activities. This helps landowners get the benefits of government programs, improve habitat, and make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming can bring more plants and animals because it does not use chemicals in soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to manage pests, weeds, and soil without chemicals. Small organic farms do not have the same benefits as big farms. Other practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and managing plant growth, also need more work. Landowners might need financial help or expert advice to make the most profit and improve habitat quality.\n\nThe land is next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which protects many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, might soon be endangered.\n\nNative Americans lived here for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers settled here in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood production.\n\nI found a property on a real estate website and researched government programs to help small farmers reduce costs and protect wildlife.

            "There is a strong bond between brothers. It cannot be broken. This bond has many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. When they look at each other, they see themselves. In difficult times, this bond shows its true nature, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a big cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother sees himself in his brother’s eyes, he sees his true self. Their true character is shown in their actions and the results of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this bond and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a richly described land. Their journey is hard and ends in sadness. In the end, only one brother survives.

The narrator’s view shows the complex feelings of the main character and his view of the world, which affect his actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions are driven by one feeling: pride. From the first time he and Doodle go out together to their last trip, the main character feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach how to hold his breath, run, jump, or climb vines. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with in the pine tree behind the barn. This was not possible because Doodle was born with a weak heart. It was unlikely he would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was tough for the main character, whose dreams were crushed. He even felt anger towards Doodle and thought about hurting him. But when Doodle smiled, his heart softened. This simple act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology became more advanced, the way we talk about the brain changed too. First, people said the brain was like a wax tablet. Then, they said it was like a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a computer. These comparisons can be helpful, but they can also lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation processing starts with input from the senses. The senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals the brain can understand. The brain processes this information in different ways. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at simple things like color and shape to figure out it is a box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, the brain uses this information to quickly recognize the box. This is called top-down processing. Top-down processing can also help you see that it is a black box and not a hole.\n\nAfter processing, the brain decides which information is important. This is done by an attention filter. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the blades, but you do not notice each one. However, if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it. Attention affects how we process information at many stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must be stored first. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, which means it is changed into a form the brain can store. For example, words can be encoded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. Working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds. It is thought that this is done by signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory might be kept by special protein structures.\n\nThere are many ideas about how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computers, and others on how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are nodes for concepts, and they are linked by how related they are. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden.\"",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a big financial crisis. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market fell apart. Many large and important companies in America were in trouble. This problem still affects us today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of poor political choices. These choices pushed banks to give risky loans. The financial system was not strong enough to handle these loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also pressured to work with these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks did not have enough money to cover the losses. This caused problems for the economy.\n\nThe crisis began in 1999 during President Clinton's time. He wanted to stay popular to win another term. The Clinton team made it easier for people to get loans. This set the stage for the crisis that came seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this. He said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.” Holmes also warned that this could cause problems if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad lending decisions led to the economy's downfall.\n\nMany things caused the economy to fail. One was the new and complicated way loans were handled. Adjustable-rate loans and other complex financial products were common before the crisis. These made the housing market connect deeply with the economy. Many households and financial markets put too much into housing. They became very weak to small price changes.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held these risky loans suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply. Lehman Brothers fell apart. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with more rules. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion in mortgage debt. The government took control of them in September 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the background. It can be interesting or boring. Some readers may stop reading if there is too much information. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information in a story.\n\nExposition can be a problem.\n\nMany writers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin sometimes writes long parts with too much information. Exposition is the little voice that tells you to explain everything before getting to the good parts. It is not the same as the voice that wants you to tell every detail about a character's past.\n\nExposition is when you tell the audience what happened. In movies, it is when a character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author tells the story.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told the main character met her love somewhere, they got married, and her husband was killed in front of her. This might take up two pages, with little talking. But you would expect more. You would want to see how much the husband loves his wife, and how the heroine's life changed because of him. This would help you feel for the husband and understand the heroine better. You would be sad when he dies, and you would feel closer to the heroine.\n\nYou want more detail than just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details. Sometimes, it is easy to skip over things. You might introduce a new character and know he was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and ate Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story as it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and had been arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. There were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it was because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed that when minorities are victims of a crime, they are not given much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of attention. But if a minority person is a victim, it might not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They gave details about where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was short, but they wanted to keep it as a \"teaser\" so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I found it curious that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I do not know if they thought that sounded harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. Yet, it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the mix of different investments like an index fund. It also offers benefits of owning a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as few as one share. These benefits are appealing. The cost of ETFs is lower than that of mutual funds. But, there are some drawbacks. You must pay a fee on any trade with ETFs, just like with stocks. Another good thing about ETFs is the many different funds you can choose from. It is important for a smart investor to check if the benefits like diversification truly exist. We will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a mix of the ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to group these stocks for a higher return. \n\nTo study the ETF, we will not use every stock it holds. We will only use the top ten stocks. These make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 stocks and their share of total assets.\n\nTo find out how well these ten stocks show what the ETF IHF is like, we can use the current % of assets, adjusted to 100%. We calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio had only these 10 stocks in the same share as the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we see that the return of a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in return. The Beta of the top ten stocks is .12 lower than the ETF. The results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the averages of these two portfolios are not very different from each other.\n\nTo find out if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We adjust them to 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Look at Figure 17. In the third month of the project, there was a big drop in commuter log submissions. This was sad, and we do not know why it happened. Winter starts on the New England campus, and fewer people walk or bike. This could be why fewer logs were submitted. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget about the commuter log. December also has the holiday season, and students and teachers have a long break. They do not come to campus much. Classes start again in late January. This could explain the low number of logs then. But it does not explain the low number in February. At first, a project can have a lot of energy and excitement. This may go down over time. To fix this, we had Carpool Challenge Week in March. This increased log submissions. We learned it is hard to keep up interest in a project because of natural decrease and holiday breaks in schools.\n\nAnother challenge is people like driving cars. It gives freedom and independence. It is part of our culture. We need to give reasons to choose other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift certificates to local places and some big stores. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle or a hybrid car would help. This might stop the drop in interest. The prizes did not change during the project. If prizes got better over time, it might help. Gift cards were good at first. But if we added bicycles in December and a car in January, maybe more people would join.",
            "I looked through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them. These films used clever editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style. I also looked at some films that had different features. Most trick films at that time were made on a set. They were filmed like a stage play. The camera did not move. The shots were long or medium. Each film was usually one shot. But some films at the start of the twentieth century used more than one shot.\n\nMost trick films shared the same style. They were filmed indoors on a stage. The camera stayed in one place. This style came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. In these films, people moved side to side. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors came in from the right and moved back and forth. Even when they left the frame, the camera did not follow.\n\nThe style of shooting meant the shots were mostly long. Sometimes they were medium. Close-up shots were not used. This was like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience saw the whole stage. In early films, actors stayed in the middle. Close-ups did not happen.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one shot was one film. This made them short, about a minute long. The trick films did not tell long stories. They showed short tricks like magic or making things disappear. But one shot in the viewer's eyes was not really one physical shot. It could be made of several shots joined to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It seems like one shot, but you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic style. Some say it lacks depth, while others admire its \"terrible sublime\" quality (Burke). The first \"Gothic Novel\" was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole used ideas from both old and new romances to create a new kind of story. He mixed old theater elements with new details from nature. This created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre includes past elements from medieval theater, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was already used to describe different peoples, styles, and times. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style combines the old drama with the new novel format. This lets readers see the characters' thoughts more clearly. This mix helps Gothic stories stay interesting, even for readers today.  \nOne main idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. This medieval idea is about training knights to be brave and good. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows a classic knight's bravery and honor. Writers like Walpole felt that society lacked these traits. By using chivalry, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized. It is used to try to make the present better. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was worried about politics and the future. He may have thought that the goodness of people from the gothic past was lost in his time. This idea is seen in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, readers learn he has many chivalric traits.  \n\nFrederic is described with many traditional knightly images. He is a prince, has faced tragedy, and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, leading to the Gothic theme of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods. It starts with a customer order. Then it goes through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained that it is about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction comes first in supply chain management. It is the base for the whole process. Production looks at when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can learn this by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need. After studying the market, managers decide what to make and how many. They also decide where to make the products. They choose the best place for making a lot and for good quality. They must keep customer needs in mind. \n\nAfter choosing the place for making products, managers plan work schedules and keep machines in good shape. Production is very important. Every detail is vital. If not planned well, it can cost the company time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have a plan for everything, like how workers should dress and how to get shipments from trucks. These plans help the company run smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making decisions on a facility’s main skills and partnerships. A company can have different parts for making one product. Each part has its own tools, workers, and skills. The manager decides which part is best for each process. Management might also hire other companies to help. They do this to work faster. This means giving good service and being flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often have many details and focus on the upper class of the time. Two novels that are called Victorian but are different are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These books use mystery and strange events, which are not common in other books from that time. This makes the characters stronger and shows more about what they feel and why they do things.\n\nHere is a part from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, many confusing ideas came into his mind. He seemed to walk between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. He heard their words. When he paid attention, he found he was talking to them. Suddenly, he was shocked by the sound of guns. There were loud cries, lights flashed, and all was loud and chaotic, as some unseen hand took him quickly away. Through all these quick visions, he felt a pain that tired and bothered him all the time.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange events often show what Oliver feels inside, what hurts him, and what he understands about the things happening around him. In chapter 28, when the shooting is talked about again, Oliver remembers it like a dream, while he looks for help. The part shows that Oliver had no control over what happened and how bad his health had become. He sees Sikes and Crackit in his mind. The shooting takes over his senses, and he does not notice the “unseen hand” that takes him away. He feels his sadness again, without the shock of pain, as the pain is now always there and connected with fear. Since Oliver is overwhelmed, it makes you wonder who caused his trouble, because it was not him. This shows that Oliver cannot control events, even when his life is in danger. It also suggests that Oliver feels more defeated, like old Fagin is starting to break him and make him accept this sadness, affecting how he reacts. Otherwise, we might think that Oliver would try to do something, at least to save his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its silence and short in its few hours.”",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had trouble reading. I noticed something unusual. He could say some letters well, but not others. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke English perfectly. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few kids while others were on a field trip. Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we talked. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope this helped him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools. This is common in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even children who speak English well can have trouble reading. We all know this problem is real. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more help with English reading, letters, and sounds. But for other children who do not speak much English, it is harder. There is no single answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, regular classes, private tutors, and ESL classes. We should combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Studies show that children in bilingual programs do better in school. Some people fear it wastes resources and does not help most students. But that is wrong. If we use these programs for all, every child will benefit. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No. That is not practical. But we can have special helpers or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are young, many of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some learn about it in Sunday school or Temple. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religion of their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they know. We might choose one belief and then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoked together. The rain filled the gutters and soaked the plants. He looked into the rain, half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over months, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was thinner too. He looked into the rain and avoided my eyes. I felt alone and scared. I could not tell him I would miss him because it would make it real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and looked into the rain with him.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain. It only kept him alive a few more months. I did not know the value of this when he only suffered longer. I wondered what kind of God would do this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, I thought, he stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him pass from this life. So I did not. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than others did, and I knew he would not want me to watch his death. I stayed in bed for three days and waited for news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for strong opinions about personal freedom and government. He believed in a farming system. This idea was the base of his thoughts on government. He wanted to protect and support what he saw as the best job. This belief shaped his views on who should have power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could build a perfect system. There were no old customs to stop the new government. This allowed for self-rule. He believed in natural rights for all people. He said these rights are linked. If one right is lost, all rights lose value. These rights should not be taken by the government. He said in a \"state of nature,\" strong and clever people win. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor believed a good society needs a government. This government should understand the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong ideas about right and wrong. He said government, run by people, will have human virtues and faults. He said good rules protect private property, help farming, and limit capitalism. A government with good rules will be fair, even if leaders are greedy. He thought self-interest drives people. It is bad when it harms others. A good government keeps man's bad side in check. But it must be watched to stop bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be strictly followed. He wanted a small Federal government. It should only have powers clearly given in the Constitution. He thought a big Federal government costs a lot and could become oppressive. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution is risky. Without knowing what the writers meant, it could lead to problems. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide of the United States. It shows the country as states with their own powers, not one single nation.",
            "I looked down. My mind tried to understand what I saw. I did not feel anything. I watched closely but did not connect my thoughts to any deeper ideas. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts, just a flow of seeing. \n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about drawing and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to use a square frame around a picture. This makes a big picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easy to see as just the bowl of fruit. \n\nAt that moment, I was looking at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist's frame in my mind. I was too amazed to do anything but look. Artists like Picasso, Monet, and those from the Italian Renaissance had their styles. If I wanted to call my view Art, then this was the start of my work, my story—Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my tool. My hand moved as I wished, ready to create. Water spun around, clear and smooth. Bits of stuff floated away. My hand moved quickly again, hitting the toilet handle. The brown thing stayed, stuck at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nI held a mop and stood with my feet apart. My green tie felt tight around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the mess someone left in the Rite Aid bathroom. After a few more flushes and quiet moments, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent down. My hand went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a turkey.",
            "Young people are dying in car crashes. Many reasons cause this problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents, car rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. They often do this. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens. They have rules for temporary licenses. These rules limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other young people as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, are not ready to handle driving risks. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says even 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman’s research shows young people like to take risks for excitement. So, it might be better to wait until this thrill-seeking is less strong. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly crashes. Many young people will be driving by 2010.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be simple. Schools can offer driving classes, but no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could be given before a full license, and some practice hours would be needed. The number of hours could be like those in most states. For example, in California, it is now 6 hours of training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since the bad statistics for teen drivers are similar in all states, a national law would help protect teens everywhere.\n\nThis idea for a law is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short meaning of the disorder. Next, it explains how to know if someone has it, with common signs to watch for. Finally, the paper ends with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the central nervous system uses what we hear. It means the brain cannot process sounds right. People with CAPD can hear fine, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But, the part of the brain that understands what we hear does not work as it should.\n\nThe first time people talked about this disorder was in the mid-1950s. It was called \"auditory imperception\" then. Researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to understand how the brain works with hearing. In 1977, a big meeting helped start more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show in many ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble telling the difference between sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or changes in speech. One sound might block another. They may not understand sound clues or the order of sounds.\n\nTo know if someone has CAPD, they must be checked by watching how they listen and respond. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test that works for everyone, and no known cause for CAPD. Tests may include asking people to tell apart different sounds and recording responses to signals in the ear.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who have been hurt or ignored. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring these values to social work: service, respect, ethics, and commitment. I want to help people improve their relationships and become better in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job I wanted. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of what I saw, I chose to study Psychology. But I still did not know what job to choose. So, after I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One summer day, I met a friend. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy. He was nervous. She said he was there to get away from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the police to his parents’ home. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and told them about my degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak to the parents. The law could not help the boy. I talked to the parents. They seemed nervous. They made excuses and said their son was lying. After this, I thought more about a job in social work. I want to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say each person is important, but we still want everyone to be the same. I think it is better to be different. In high school and college, I stood against social injustice. I dyed my hair different colors. I wore clothes that showed who I am. I pierced my ears more than usual. I joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought against racism and discrimination when I saw it. I believe in social justice. I will keep fighting against social injustice.",
            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model studies genes that are passed down and medical parts of health. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment relates to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia talks about these models and explains each study chosen to help understand the models. The research findings are then examined to show their strong and weak points.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, a disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a disorder linked to other problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are linked to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a problem with getting or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake, both for at least one month. Narcolepsy includes cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and staying asleep, while Parasomnias are related to unusual behaviors or physical happenings during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep problems due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice showed that there are GABAB receptors on these neurons that control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor helps sleep. If this receptor is stopped from working, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from mice can apply to humans. This shows a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep well without medicine. The sociocultural meaning of this study is that if the trait was inherited, it could affect sleep. Changing the receptor would disturb sleep, which would negatively affect areas like school, work, and daily activities that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Moving around campus is a problem for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in a dorm room at East Halls, which is very far east on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which happens often in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, who said that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another becomes harder. What is the best way to solve this problem? On a college campus, the answer is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made for bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after not doing so for many years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.\" Biking is good for your body and it is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms. The best thing I did this year was to buy a bike. I have class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road is the quickest way to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel on, even with a bike. Walking has its good points too, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s more than two and a half hours each week. Add all the other time I would spend walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I can afford.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They are taught to seek quick happiness above all else. The people are controlled by a bigger plan set by the World Controller. When we look at this book with Marxist ideas, we see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism like \"false consciousness\" show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of with the idea of false consciousness from Marxism. Regular people do not understand their real class relations because they only care about their own gain. This is because of control over workers, shown in how people are taught in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, have no real will. They are taught to buy and spend through sleep-teaching. The World Controller uses this to control them. Groups are controlled by other groups. Lower classes do not know they are controlled and support the system of capitalism and consumerism. Higher classes know but do little about it. Only some, like Bernard, question their place. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships. Characters are not deep, even main ones. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do strong feelings. Interactions are shallow, with men talking about women’s looks and women talking about their encounters. Each class is happy with their place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in society shows Marxist ideas about workers who think they are better as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One main topic in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. This question is even more important today. Since 9/11, I have seen the media change. At first, it showed Islam as hostile. Now, it is very tolerant of Islam in America. I think, in 2001, we could not have a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me. What I know about Muhammad's history seems different from the biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography shows Muhammad as misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they saw truth in his teaching.\n\nThere are similarities between Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. For example, Muhammad took mutton and milk and made it enough for forty men. This writing style makes me think the writers wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This is hard for me because it makes Jesus's life and miracles seem less important. It feels like they take credit for Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography try to show how people converted to Islam. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true and more suspicious to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly, humble, and gentle man. But history shows something else. I wonder if Muslims today know about the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought developed after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is more awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people hold on to old beliefs and resist change, but they may not be enough to affect everyone. Among Christians, knowledge of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what was added to Christianity and what Jesus really wanted. This change may take a long time, but it will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will grow, removing added ideas, and going back to what Jesus taught. As this change happens in the United States and Europe, people will worship like in Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will stay strong to lead. But, beliefs and practices will become more alike instead of different. Over time, there have been big changes in history. For example, Christians were once hurt by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became Christian. In our country, we have moved from slavery to leadership for African-Americans. The big change coming will be in the Christian religion, going back to its source, and becoming less diverse. This change will happen by reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, not literal. So what happened since Jesus’ time? If we look back in history, we find only Judaism, which started Christianity. Belief in one God, a revealed religion, and Hebrew scriptures were all important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that, deep down, people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care only about themselves and making their lives better. They do not care about people lower than them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The main example is the owners and managers of big factories. They want to make their companies as big and great as possible. They do not care who or what gets hurt in their way. \n\nUpton Sinclair describes the pollution from the factories. He writes about big chimneys and smoke going into the sky. Sinclair wants to show the damage from this pollution. He shows that the owners do not care about people or animals who might get hurt. They do not care about the smoke coming from the factories or the waste from the animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They do anything to save or make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" \n\nWorkers have to work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. During the time of \"The Jungle,\" there were few laws to protect workers. Managers and owners could do what they wanted. Workers had to work fast and in bad conditions. The book shows that workers had to deal with these bad conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions were formed, but they often hurt more than they helped because they took money from poor workers. \n\nWorkers were treated so badly that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" This shows that workers had no escape from the system. They were always close to starvation and depended on cruel men.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word goes back to Virgil. Virgil used \"Thule\" to mean an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this was the edge of the known world. But there is a more recent link to this word. Poe liked German writers. This is important because it shows Poe knew about Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote about Poe and Goethe. He said Poe's poem was like Goethe's work. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust. It was published in two parts, in 1808 and 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses her. He decides to die, gives his things to his children, but keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, and dies. The King of Thule and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are a lot alike. It might show Poe's own feelings of loss.\n\nPoe uses the word \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He first uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as similar works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. The speaker sees dead friends and a world without color. In Goethe's poem, the king is also lonely after losing his wife. It feels like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe likely knew of him. Poe also respected Tennyson. This connection to Tennyson would have led Poe to Goethe’s work. Goethe's work was reproduced many times after it first came out. This is how Poe might have known it.",
            "In California, can a customer who slipped on an applesauce spill in a store get extra money as punishment for the store? The customer must show the manager acted with bad intent. The manager knew about the spill twice but did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge may not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer's request for extra money. To get this money, Palmer must show the manager's actions were done with a willful disregard for harm. She must also show the actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin, the manager, should have known not cleaning the spill was dangerous. Many people had already slipped in the store in the months before Palmer's accident. Even with this knowledge, Martin did not clean the spill. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong. But it is still possible because six slip-and-fall accidents happened in 2009, and Martin did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and did not want to deal with it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for money to cover her injury and extra money for punishment. We are thinking about asking the court to reject the request for extra money.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money for punishment if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone intended to cause harm or acted very badly and ignored others' safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the defendant knew the actions were dangerous and still did it. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt like she needed something. This desire could not be satisfied. It started when she was 14, just starting her teenage years. It was still there 3 years later, when she was 17. By now, she thought she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her heart, but no one interested her. She often asked herself about this strange feeling, trying to find out why she felt this way. She had some ideas, but nothing clear. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually calm. Her parents were good and quiet people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with their daughter. They only argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she had a lively and fun personality. This made her well-liked because she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, trying to find inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter ran to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were rushed and tight, and the daughter knew she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Her mother showed her hands, and the daughter was glad she had learned to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nAt the hospital, there were smells of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice that, because she was too busy helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother in and called for help. Some worried people came, and someone brought a rolling bed and laid her mother down. They took her to be checked right away, and the daughter sat and waited with worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aims to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes eating more plant foods, such as plant proteins, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes eating more monounsaturated fat (not saturated fat) and fish, and eating less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in small amounts is okay.\n\nEarlier studies found that following a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of death from heart disease. One study showed that the Med diet helped people lose weight better than a low-fat diet. It also lowered the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Past studies did not focus on stroke or deaths from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which included 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake in the past year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were marked \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use after menopause were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, physical activity during free time was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random differences for a person and better show long-term diet intake, averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use after menopause, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using different models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher aMed diet score was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The unsettling message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is controlled by a harsh military group that took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests, the first in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. People called it “The Saffron Revolution,” named for the color of the monks' robes. At first, more people showed interest in the protests. The Burmese government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon the situation became violent. Some saw it as a war between the monks and the military. Soldiers invaded and destroyed monasteries. Foreign reporters were arrested and jailed. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, while at a street protest. The official number of deaths is 13. But an army officer, Colonel Hla Win, who left the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to stop protests and keep complete control for a long time. Roman emperors said they were chosen by the gods to rule. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to lead their people. Our current president, George W. Bush, talks every week with Ted Haggard, leader of a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the government. The death count varies. The Chinese government says 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, with help from the Rwandan government, killed many Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. During that time, many Jewish people were rounded up and killed.",
            "Duke Ellington is important in jazz because he lived a long time and was very creative. He was good at leading his band. On the piano, Ellington was often subtle, but he was great at writing music. He made complex pieces that showed the skills of his band members. Ellington let soloists improvise, and he also wrote pieces that used the special style of his band members. This made the band sound unique and original. He knew how each player sounded and how they fit together in the band. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice like a jazz instrument. This was an early example of using voice to add color without words. In Creole Love Call, Ellington showed he could match the style of his soloists. This piece is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\n1. First part: Voice and reeds call and respond. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\n2. Second part: Muted trumpet plays the melody with blue notes.\n3. Third part: Clarinet solo in high notes, with a soft piano behind it.\n4. Fourth part: The full band echoes the first part with brass and reeds.\n5. Fifth part: The reeds call and respond in high notes, with brass and rhythm backing.\n6. Sixth part: Like the first part, voice and reeds call and respond. The voice uses the “growl” technique.\n\nEnd: A quick vocal run and a strange trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add a new sound. This is a style he used often. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington mixed tight writing with tone color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing made a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas more. Ellington used Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that shape how they change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that scientists had hardly begun to describe simple living forms using math, and this is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusk shells form over time (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study looks at how math models and experiments can show how and why these changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help model shell shapes. These numbers were put into a program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We made models of shell shapes to see what changes are possible in Prunum. These results are mixed with studies to learn more about big changes over time in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that moves through space. The turns of the shell are called whorls, and they spiral around a central line called the columella. The size of whorls can change, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one. The spire is all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from the top, bottom, front, and back. Normally, a shell is viewed from the front, with the opening facing the viewer and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, and estimate to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of these openings by using the center, and the size of each opening.\n\nThis path can be shown in pictures and math. Once you have a math model, you can change the numbers to see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in reaching some goals, like clean water and toilets. But, it is not doing well in making sure mothers and children are healthier. There are many reasons why this is happening. We need to make the health system stronger instead of only making new programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress with more babies being born with a trained health worker present. Now, 72% of births have a health worker there. But, this number also includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there is a problem during birth. This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding. So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems, and more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea see a health worker now. We do not have all the information about care for mothers after birth, but it is a concern too, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of Cesarean sections are still low, around 4%. There is a problem because 7% of these happen in cities but only 2% happen in rural areas. This shows that healthcare services are mainly in cities. Another problem is that poor people use health services much less than rich people. There is a 27% gap between the poorest and richest groups. The poor find it hard to get healthcare, likely because they have to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nTo make care for mothers and babies better, we need to think about the best way to fix the problem. Should Indonesia make programs just for this issue, or should it make the whole health system better? Making programs for one specific area can seem like a good idea. These programs have clear goals and can show results faster. But there are problems too. Spending a lot on one program can mean less money for other programs. People may leave other areas to work where there is more money, like happened with funding for HIV/AIDS affecting family planning. Also, having many programs for the same thing can mean repeated work and uncoordinated services, leading to more forms and paperwork.",
            "Popular music has changed a lot in the past 100 years. There are now many types of music. It is hard to name them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups within it. Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most varied and expressive types in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often darker ones. It is diverse because people saw it could change. They made new styles from it. This led to even more new styles.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is now. It has mixed with other types of music. But, like all things, it started from something. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement known for its dark side. It is a \"music of more\"—more bass, more noise, more intensity, more drama. Metal band members are skilled with their instruments, and it shows. Metal is also known for its link to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used psychedelic drugs. This led them to make strange and intense music. Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new because much popular music was not dark. Later metal bands took ideas from the Romantic Era. The lyrics show the darkness that is key to metal.\n\nHelter Skelter by The Beatles shows this dark side. It has ups and downs, like a drug experience. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show they could be as heavy as The Rolling Stones. They put it on The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists painted dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau made his own dream paintings. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman amazed by the dream world she sees. This painting also shows Rousseau's dreams and hopes as a painter. From the start, he wanted other artists and art lovers to accept and praise him. He faced a hard choice to reach this goal. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: should he copy popular art styles to fit in, or be unique and follow his own way?\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau had no formal art training. He worked for France in a toll service job until age forty. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His first wife, Clémence, died after losing eight babies, leaving him with one daughter, Julia. Full of sadness, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and new hope. Unlike others who romanticized peasant life, he was a folk painter with simple hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He had no formal training and started painting late. He also painted at the same time as famous artists. He got recognition only when Matisse was becoming known. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared being boring, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would get him into Artiste Français.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong link between what is good and what is beautiful, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. In a poem, John Keats says, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful, as Keats suggests, without being taught in these usual ways. Both ideas try to explain rather than tell us what to do. Our study of what is right and what is beautiful is mostly about why a piece of art or writing is good, or why an action is right, rather than rules for making good art or doing good things.\n\nAlso, talking about art or morals can never completely show what is truly good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss things like the front, the back, how colors are used, or the culture it comes from. But these do not fully explain why it is good art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art or book, they say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed answer. I think art and morals can never be fully explained by their parts. As Flannery O'Connor says, a story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way. Even if we describe all parts of a book, there is still something more. I think the same is true for what is right. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something,\" this hard-to-explain quality, is the strongest part of both art and what is right. This makes a link between the two.\n\nI think art and what is right are closely connected because we feel both deeply, even if we can't fully explain them. This link is even stronger in literature. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature is important because of the values we find in it, just like in life.",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a unique culture from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also felt in Köln, on the river Rhine, through the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Germany's culture comes from many different sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is called Germania. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars. He took the word from the Gauls to tell them apart from the tribes he had not conquered. Some think it meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. Caesar wrote about the Germans beyond the Rhine, who often fought the Gauls. Others say the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or from an Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" showing Germans as loud.\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the Germans in AD 98. He believed they were native to their land and not mixed with others. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its harsh land and weather, unless it was their home.\n\nRomans did not want to live in Germania. They sent expeditions for goods and fought sometimes, but they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire’s borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while wearing a disguise can help deceive others for a long time, a person must eventually stop pretending. Otherwise, they might lose who they really are. Ending a deception is hard because it can make a person feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others may get upset and feel hurt by the deception.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be the opposite gender is difficult. One important question is why someone would hide their true identity this way. For Viola, it is a form of protection. She says: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Viola is in a strange place and thinks she must pretend to be a man to stay safe from danger. Her plan works, but it also cuts her off from the women who could support her. Also, she looks so much like a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Olivia says, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has to deal with hidden feelings between her and Orsino, who says: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo today’s readers, Twelfth Night may show how deception can reveal hidden feelings, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters might have feelings they do not fully understand until Viola/Cesario makes them face these emotions. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems she does not, as Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in its colonies was often very harsh. This was clear in the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But, not all of the German colonial empire was the same. Each colony had different ways of ruling and teaching. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also praised by writers of that time.\n\nIn South West Africa, it was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government started schools for Africans, education in South West Africa was mostly left to missions with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on education for Europeans there, building state schools and helping mission schools more. This led to long-term effects. While many Africans in other German colonies could read and write, most in South West Africa could not. Many reasons led to this difference. This paper will look at these reasons and focus on new studies about settler and government views on Africans.\n\nThere are many writings on education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mainly showed what the school systems were like. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies and looked at details. These showed big differences in education between colonies. The most important study on this topic is by Cohen. Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared the school systems and explained why they were different. Cohen said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa was a key reason for its unique education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a better climate than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was more than the 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States attacked and defeated Mexico. The United States gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other clashes between the two countries. The rivalry slowed down just before the First World War. It began because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and material interests.  \n\nThis is similar to many countries that have a rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have clashes of interests. This can create rival positions between them. The United States and Mexico are like many other rivalries between countries that share a common border. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both of these countries are close to the United States. They have been rivals, while other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.  \n\nReligious issues caused a split between the two countries. This problem has affected many countries through history. Sally Frahm says that in the twentieth century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, there was an ideological struggle. But this struggle was about religious preferences, not political structure. The distrust came from the distrust between the English and Spanish. This feeling of distrust was a big obstacle in creating friendly relations between the United States and Mexico.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues and border raids from Mexico. There were also problems with outlaws from American border towns. This was a major problem until both countries used military force on their borders.  \n\nSchmitt explains that the rivalry began to slow down as Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States. It ended when American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I never knew about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this work because I needed safety and security. I did not have these as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, at 46 years old, I was single and had no money. I could not work. I am still disabled today. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing that is mine. I get by, but every day is hard. My life is not sure anymore. But one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and friends. Even strong people need help in hard times. \n\nLife will always have emergencies. There are no guarantees. No matter how prepared you are, some problems are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that people in the U.S. should not depend only on big government. It is not steady. But I think we should trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help. We should not just build shelters alone. \n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But what helped our ancestors was compassion, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone. \n\nSo, be ready. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water tablets, and plastic sheets. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned foods. If you can grow and preserve your food, do it. It is a good idea. A wood stove is also good if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. One day, he would be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became wise. His teachings started Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It is different now than when Buddha was alive. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country. There, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and other people take part in it. This ceremony has some religious meaning, even though Buddha did not talk about such events. These changes are seen in both the simple traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group has changed its ideas over time. This is because of forces from both inside and outside, and some are good while others are not.\n\nThere are some terms we will use often. There is \"internal\" versus \"external.\" An internal force comes from members of the Buddhasasana, whether they are monks or not. An external force is from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or wants to harm Buddhists. A benign force does not want to hurt or help Buddhists, but it might do one of these by accident. We will talk about these terms often.\n\nFirst, let us look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which means three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has deep ideas like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes). By knowing these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth. When Sansara ends, so do lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life. For laymen, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in sex, and do not take drugs or alcohol. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is important in any negotiation. Culture can be known by what it is not, as well as by what it is. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing. It is not all the same. Saying “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are agreeable” is too simple. It is good to know what a culture is like, but it is better to know how that culture affects talks between people. When a person meets a foreign culture, they see it in a way that makes sense with their own culture. They compare the two.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture can mean learning its history or knowing its prejudices. Instead of trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work with it, especially in talks where one has less power. If a person is in a different place, respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in talks.\n\nCulture is not just about different countries. Companies in the same country have their own culture. A company might want people to work long hours, or it might have a relaxed schedule. Company culture shows in how people dress, talk, and hire. Some companies allow all workers to help charities, others limit it to certain causes. American companies have different cultures, even within the same company in different places. Some cultures are less divided and might look the same from the outside, but it is important to look deeper.\n\nValues are also important because they explain why a culture acts in a certain way. If keeping respect or working together is important, a person will not shame their company or boss to win a negotiation. Someone from a culture that likes tough deals may not rush to settle talks. It is important to think about these things before talks. A negotiator should also learn about the person they are negotiating with to make talks better.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This line is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. It is also the start of St. Anselm's idea about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another person we will talk about, Thomas Aquinas. Since both argue for the same idea, and we need to decide who argues better, we will start by assuming that both are right about the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. If we think about a different kind of God, we cannot compare their arguments well. So, while both make good points, neither fully gives a strong reason to believe in God.\n\nFirst, we will look at St. Anselm's main idea. Anselm talks about finding understanding through faith. He says we find proof of God inside ourselves. He explains that because God is in our understanding, we cannot think that God does not exist. This idea can be hard to follow, but basically, proof of God is in our own minds. St. Anselm says we do not need outside proof. The truth about God is in what we know to be true inside us. This idea of accepting something without strong proof is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis idea is different from what St. Thomas Aquinas believes. Aquinas says that we can prove God's existence with reason and evidence, without faith. This would help in spreading Christianity because new people could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas talks about five logical arguments for God's existence: change, cause, chance, levels of good, and order. In each, he shows that God must exist because it is logical. Like when you know a puzzle has a missing piece, you can know what it looks like without seeing it just by using logic.",
            "Writers often use different ways to give readers a feeling or attitude about important subjects. Some ways work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald puts together words that do not usually fit, like an adjective and a noun, to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it to create this feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds meaning for colors like white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white/gray is sameness. White is nicer and higher class, while gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this meaning at the start of the book by using both colors often. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white.\" Everyone wears white: Nick has \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" People are not wearing white when Nick sees Gatsby’s party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" to work, names at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" on Nick’s list, and Catherine’s apartment is one \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—showing sameness. He also uses white or gray for plain people or places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter building meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show unimportance or sameness in things. This starts with Daisy. After not using these colors for a while, he describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Readers see Daisy as less of a character and more of something Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique to show Daisy as a uniform addition, like the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in \"white\" before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops because it has a mild and sunny climate. Common crops are tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. Many local groups have long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours and allow hiking, birdwatching, and other fun activities. This helps landowners get the benefits of government programs, improve habitat, and make money from tours and education programs.\n\nOrganic farming can bring more plants and animals because it does not use chemicals in soil and water. But organic farming costs more than regular farming. It needs more work to manage pests, weeds, and soil without chemicals. Small organic farms do not have the same benefits as big farms. Other practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and managing plant growth, also need more work. Landowners might need financial help or expert advice to make the most profit and improve habitat quality.\n\nThe land is next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which protects many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. Others, like burrowing owls, might soon be endangered.\n\nNative Americans lived here for many years. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers settled here in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead and was probably used for grazing and wood production.\n\nI found a property on a real estate website and researched government programs to help small farmers reduce costs and protect wildlife. I also found an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might do.",
            "There is a strong bond between brothers. It cannot be broken. This bond has many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. When they look at each other, they see themselves. In difficult times, this bond shows its true nature, whether good or bad. These feelings come with a big cost. Understanding these feelings means dealing with what they bring. When a brother sees himself in his brother’s eyes, he sees his true self. Their true character is shown in their actions and the results of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this bond and the strong feelings it brings. They travel through a richly described land. Their journey is hard and ends in sadness. In the end, only one brother survives. The story shows this theme through the main character, Doodle, and his brother's actions and thoughts. The narrator’s view shows the complex feelings of the main character and his view of the world, which affect his actions.\n\nThe main character’s actions are driven by one feeling: pride. From the first time he and Doodle go out together to their last trip, the main character feels upset with Doodle. He wanted a brother to teach how to hold his breath, run, jump, or climb vines. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and sit with in the pine tree behind the barn. This was not possible because Doodle was born with a weak heart. It was unlikely he would survive, let alone do physical activities. This was tough for the main character, whose dreams were crushed. He even felt anger towards Doodle and thought about hurting him. But when Doodle smiled, his heart softened. This simple act gave him hope. It shows that deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology became more advanced, the way we talk about the brain changed too. First, people said the brain was like a wax tablet. Then, they said it was like a sheet of papyrus, a book, and now, a computer. These comparisons can be helpful, but they can also lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation processing starts with input from the senses. The senses change things like touch, heat, sound, or light into signals the brain can understand. The brain processes this information in different ways. For example, when you see a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at simple things like color and shape to figure out it is a box. This is called bottom-up processing. Then, the brain uses this information to quickly recognize the box. This is called top-down processing. Top-down processing can also help you see that it is a black box and not a hole.\n\nAfter processing, the brain decides which information is important. This is done by an attention filter. For instance, when you look at grass, your brain sees all the blades, but you do not notice each one. However, if someone says your name in a loud room, you might hear it. Attention affects how we process information at many stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must be stored first. There are different kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, which means it is changed into a form the brain can store. For example, words can be encoded by how they look, sound, or what they mean. Working memory keeps information for about 20 seconds. It is thought that this is done by signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory might be kept by special protein structures.\n\nThere are many ideas about how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computers, and others on how the brain works. One idea is the semantic network model. It says there are nodes for concepts, and they are linked by how related they are. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden.\"",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a big financial crisis. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market fell apart. Many large and important companies in America were in trouble. This problem still affects us today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The crisis happened because of poor political choices. These choices pushed banks to give risky loans. The financial system was not strong enough to handle these loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also pressured to work with these loans. When people could not pay back the loans, banks did not have enough money to cover the losses. This caused problems for the economy.\n\nThe crisis began in 1999 during President Clinton's time. He wanted to stay popular to win another term. The Clinton team made it easier for people to get loans. This set the stage for the crisis that came seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this. He said, “Fannie Mae has pressure to give more loans to people with low and moderate income.” Holmes also warned that this could cause problems if the economy got worse. He was right. Bad lending decisions led to the economy's downfall.\n\nMany things caused the economy to fail. One was the new and complicated way loans were handled. Adjustable-rate loans and other complex financial products were common before the crisis. These made the housing market connect deeply with the economy. Many households and financial markets put too much into housing. They became very weak to small price changes.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that held these risky loans suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007. This was about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold cheaply. Lehman Brothers fell apart. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with more rules. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion in mortgage debt. The government took control of them in September 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the background. It can be interesting or boring. Some readers may stop reading if there is too much information. Dr. Merlin sometimes gets upset when there is too much information in a story.\n\nExposition can be a problem.\n\nMany writers know the tip, \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin sometimes writes long parts with too much information. Exposition is the little voice that tells you to explain everything before getting to the good parts. It is not the same as the voice that wants you to tell every detail about a character's past.\n\nExposition is when you tell the audience what happened. In movies, it is when a character tells another a lot of information. In books, the author tells the story.\n\nHere is an example. In a story, you are told the main character met her love somewhere, they got married, and her husband was killed in front of her. This might take up two pages, with little talking. But you would expect more. You would want to see how much the husband loves his wife, and how the heroine's life changed because of him. This would help you feel for the husband and understand the heroine better. You would be sad when he dies, and you would feel closer to the heroine.\n\nYou want more detail than just \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add these details. Sometimes, it is easy to skip over things. You might introduce a new character and know he was in the Air Force, now works at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and ate Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not given, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story as it was still developing. They said he had stabbed her many times and had been arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. There were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the crime. This story was short, and I think it was because he was a black man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed that when minorities are victims of a crime, they are not given much attention. If a white child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media gives it a lot of attention. But if a minority person is a victim, it might not even be mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They gave details about where they thought it happened. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was short, but they wanted to keep it as a \"teaser\" so people would keep watching.\n\nThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store. He wore a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of planning to send large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I found it curious that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I do not know if they thought that sounded harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I do not think was important to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. Yet, it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the mix of different investments like an index fund. It also offers benefits of owning a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy as few as one share. These benefits are appealing. The cost of ETFs is lower than that of mutual funds. But, there are some drawbacks. You must pay a fee on any trade with ETFs, just like with stocks. Another good thing about ETFs is the many different funds you can choose from. It is important for a smart investor to check if the benefits like diversification truly exist. We will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks in the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a mix of the ten stocks. We also want to see if there are better ways to group these stocks for a higher return. \n\nTo study the ETF, we will not use every stock it holds. We will only use the top ten stocks. These make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 stocks and their share of total assets.\n\nTo find out how well these ten stocks show what the ETF IHF is like, we can use the current % of assets, adjusted to 100%. We calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio had only these 10 stocks in the same share as the ETF. The calculations of Beta and return are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we see that the return of a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in return. The Beta of the top ten stocks is .12 lower than the ETF. The results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is possible that the averages of these two portfolios are not very different from each other.\n\nTo find out if these portfolios are different, we find the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. We adjust them to 100% to compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Look at Figure 17. In the third month of the project, there was a big drop in commuter log submissions. This was sad, and we do not know why it happened. Winter starts on the New England campus, and fewer people walk or bike. This could be why fewer logs were submitted. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and grades. They might forget about the commuter log. December also has the holiday season, and students and teachers have a long break. They do not come to campus much. Classes start again in late January. This could explain the low number of logs then. But it does not explain the low number in February. At first, a project can have a lot of energy and excitement. This may go down over time. To fix this, we had Carpool Challenge Week in March. This increased log submissions. We learned it is hard to keep up interest in a project because of natural decrease and holiday breaks in schools.\n\nAnother challenge is people like driving cars. It gives freedom and independence. It is part of our culture. We need to give reasons to choose other ways to commute. We gave prizes like gift certificates to local places and some big stores. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle or a hybrid car would help. This might stop the drop in interest. The prizes did not change during the project. If prizes got better over time, it might help. Gift cards were good at first. But if we added bicycles in December and a car in January, maybe more people would join.",
            "I looked through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them. These films used clever editing to make illusions. I studied these films to describe their style. I also looked at some films that had different features. Most trick films at that time were made on a set. They were filmed like a stage play. The camera did not move. The shots were long or medium. Each film was usually one shot. But some films at the start of the twentieth century used more than one shot.\n\nMost trick films shared the same style. They were filmed indoors on a stage. The camera stayed in one place. This style came from theatre, vaudeville, and magic acts. In these films, people moved side to side. They did not walk toward or away from the camera. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors came in from the right and moved back and forth. Even when they left the frame, the camera did not follow.\n\nThe style of shooting meant the shots were mostly long. Sometimes they were medium. Close-up shots were not used. This was like theatre and vaudeville, where the audience saw the whole stage. In early films, actors stayed in the middle. Close-ups did not happen.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one shot was one film. This made them short, about a minute long. The trick films did not tell long stories. They showed short tricks like magic or making things disappear. But one shot in the viewer's eyes was not really one physical shot. It could be made of several shots joined to make an illusion. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It seems like one shot, but you can see when the shot with Mary's \"head\" starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic style. Some say it lacks depth, while others admire its \"terrible sublime\" quality (Burke). The first \"Gothic Novel\" was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole used ideas from both old and new romances to create a new kind of story. He mixed old theater elements with new details from nature. This created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre includes past elements from medieval theater, buildings, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was already used to describe different peoples, styles, and times. It seemed old-fashioned compared to modern ideas. The Gothic style combines the old drama with the new novel format. This lets readers see the characters' thoughts more clearly. This mix helps Gothic stories stay interesting, even for readers today.  \nOne main idea in Gothic novels is Chivalry. This medieval idea is about training knights to be brave and good. The Castle of Otranto keeps and changes this idea. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows a classic knight's bravery and honor. Writers like Walpole felt that society lacked these traits. By using chivalry, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized. It is used to try to make the present better. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was worried about politics and the future. He may have thought that the goodness of people from the gothic past was lost in his time. This idea is seen in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, readers learn he has many chivalric traits.  \n\nFrederic is described with many traditional knightly images. He is a prince, has faced tragedy, and was thought to be killed by enemies. The idea of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, leading to the Gothic theme of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods. It starts with a customer order. Then it goes through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. Keith Oliver, a consultant, invented the term supply chain management in 1982. He explained that it is about planning, doing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction comes first in supply chain management. It is the base for the whole process. Production looks at when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can learn this by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need. After studying the market, managers decide what to make and how many. They also decide where to make the products. They choose the best place for making a lot and for good quality. They must keep customer needs in mind. \n\nAfter choosing the place for making products, managers plan work schedules and keep machines in good shape. Production is very important. Every detail is vital. If not planned well, it can cost the company time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both have a plan for everything, like how workers should dress and how to get shipments from trucks. These plans help the company run smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making decisions on a facility’s main skills and partnerships. A company can have different parts for making one product. Each part has its own tools, workers, and skills. The manager decides which part is best for each process. Management might also hire other companies to help. They do this to work faster. This means giving good service and being flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian novels often have many details and focus on the upper class of the time. Two novels that are called Victorian but are different are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These books use mystery and strange events, which are not common in other books from that time. This makes the characters stronger and shows more about what they feel and why they do things.\n\nHere is a part from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, many confusing ideas came into his mind. He seemed to walk between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. He heard their words. When he paid attention, he found he was talking to them. Suddenly, he was shocked by the sound of guns. There were loud cries, lights flashed, and all was loud and chaotic, as some unseen hand took him quickly away. Through all these quick visions, he felt a pain that tired and bothered him all the time.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange events often show what Oliver feels inside, what hurts him, and what he understands about the things happening around him. In chapter 28, when the shooting is talked about again, Oliver remembers it like a dream, while he looks for help. The part shows that Oliver had no control over what happened and how bad his health had become. He sees Sikes and Crackit in his mind. The shooting takes over his senses, and he does not notice the “unseen hand” that takes him away. He feels his sadness again, without the shock of pain, as the pain is now always there and connected with fear. Since Oliver is overwhelmed, it makes you wonder who caused his trouble, because it was not him. This shows that Oliver cannot control events, even when his life is in danger. It also suggests that Oliver feels more defeated, like old Fagin is starting to break him and make him accept this sadness, affecting how he reacts. Otherwise, we might think that Oliver would try to do something, at least to save his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its silence and short in its few hours.”",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program. I helped young students with their studies. I was best at English and reading. One teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. Adrian had trouble reading. I noticed something unusual. He could say some letters well, but not others. Adrian was Latino, but he spoke English perfectly. We had a hard time until I met his mother. I was watching a few kids while others were on a field trip. Adrian's mother came in. She did not speak English, only Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, so we talked. Then I understood: Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope this helped him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about language problems in schools. This is common in California. It shows that these problems are not always clear. Even children who speak English well can have trouble reading. We all know this problem is real. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more help with English reading, letters, and sounds. But for other children who do not speak much English, it is harder. There is no single answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, regular classes, private tutors, and ESL classes. We should combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Studies show that children in bilingual programs do better in school. Some people fear it wastes resources and does not help most students. But that is wrong. If we use these programs for all, every child will benefit. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No. That is not practical. But we can have special helpers or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are young, many of us hear that there is something bigger than us. Some learn about it in Sunday school or Temple. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religion of their parents. Some do not. They say there is nothing beyond what they know. We might choose one belief and then change to another later. Whatever we choose, we try to find a part of ourselves through our own view of spirituality. We look for a light to guide us out of darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to rain on the tin roof and smoked together. The rain filled the gutters and soaked the plants. He looked into the rain, half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over months, and his clothes hung loose. His hair was thinner too. He looked into the rain and avoided my eyes. I felt alone and scared. I could not tell him I would miss him because it would make it real. I hugged him, sat down, moved my chair closer, and looked into the rain with him.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment did not ease his pain. It only kept him alive a few more months. I did not know the value of this when he only suffered longer. I wondered what kind of God would do this. Alone at night, I did not pray. If God was there, I thought, he stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI did not want to see him pass from this life. So I did not. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than others did, and I knew he would not want me to watch his death. I stayed in bed for three days and waited for news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early supporter of Republicanism. He was mainly a farmer. This work and his short time in politics made him known for strong opinions about personal freedom and government. He believed in a farming system. This idea was the base of his thoughts on government. He wanted to protect and support what he saw as the best job. This belief shaped his views on who should have power, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States could build a perfect system. There were no old customs to stop the new government. This allowed for self-rule. He believed in natural rights for all people. He said these rights are linked. If one right is lost, all rights lose value. These rights should not be taken by the government. He said in a \"state of nature,\" strong and clever people win. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor believed a good society needs a government. This government should understand the good and bad in people. Taylor had strong ideas about right and wrong. He said government, run by people, will have human virtues and faults. He said good rules protect private property, help farming, and limit capitalism. A government with good rules will be fair, even if leaders are greedy. He thought self-interest drives people. It is bad when it harms others. A good government keeps man's bad side in check. But it must be watched to stop bad rules.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, wanted the Constitution to be strictly followed. He wanted a small Federal government. It should only have powers clearly given in the Constitution. He thought a big Federal government costs a lot and could become oppressive. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution is risky. Without knowing what the writers meant, it could lead to problems. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true guide of the United States. It shows the country as states with their own powers, not one single nation.",
            "I looked down. My mind tried to understand what I saw. I did not feel anything. I watched closely but did not connect my thoughts to any deeper ideas. Thoughts came and went quickly. It felt like I had no real thoughts, just a flow of seeing. \n\nOnce, an artist I knew told me to buy a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches about drawing and how the brain sees lines. One idea in the book is to use a square frame around a picture. This makes a big picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, easy to see as just the bowl of fruit. \n\nAt that moment, I was looking at the bowl in front of me. I could not use the artist's frame in my mind. I was too amazed to do anything but look. Artists like Picasso, Monet, and those from the Italian Renaissance had their styles. If I wanted to call my view Art, then this was the start of my work, my story—Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my tool. My hand moved as I wished, ready to create. Water spun around, clear and smooth. Bits of stuff floated away. My hand moved quickly again, hitting the toilet handle. The brown thing stayed, stuck at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nI held a mop and stood with my feet apart. My green tie felt tight around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the mess someone left in the Rite Aid bathroom. After a few more flushes and quiet moments, I reached for the toilet paper. I wrapped my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent down. My hand went into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for a turkey.",
            "Young people are dying in car crashes. Many reasons cause this problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Also, teens do not have much driving experience. This lack of experience leads to more deadly accidents, car rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens have more accidents when they drive with friends. They often do this. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study. It showed a link between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens. They have rules for temporary licenses. These rules limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other young people as passengers.\n\nBut I think these licenses are only a temporary fix. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, are not ready to handle driving risks. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says even 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman’s research shows young people like to take risks for excitement. So, it might be better to wait until this thrill-seeking is less strong. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we will see more deadly crashes. Many young people will be driving by 2010.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be simple. Schools can offer driving classes, but no one under 18 should drive a car. A temporary permit could be given before a full license, and some practice hours would be needed. The number of hours could be like those in most states. For example, in California, it is now 6 hours of training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since the bad statistics for teen drivers are similar in all states, a national law would help protect teens everywhere.\n\nThis idea for a law is not new.",
            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a short meaning of the disorder. Next, it explains how to know if someone has it, with common signs to watch for. Finally, the paper ends with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is about how well the central nervous system uses what we hear. It means the brain cannot process sounds right. People with CAPD can hear fine, so they are not \"hearing impaired.\" But, the part of the brain that understands what we hear does not work as it should.\n\nThe first time people talked about this disorder was in the mid-1950s. It was called \"auditory imperception\" then. Researchers looked at children with communication problems. In 1954, the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started making tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura made new tests to understand how the brain works with hearing. In 1977, a big meeting helped start more research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show in many ways. A person may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble telling the difference between sounds. They may not recognize sound patterns or changes in speech. One sound might block another. They may not understand sound clues or the order of sounds.\n\nTo know if someone has CAPD, they must be checked by watching how they listen and respond. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test that works for everyone, and no known cause for CAPD. Tests may include asking people to tell apart different sounds and recording responses to signals in the ear.",
            "I want to study social work. I plan to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who have been hurt or ignored. I also want to help families with problems. I can bring these values to social work: service, respect, ethics, and commitment. I want to help people improve their relationships and become better in my job. These values are important to social workers and to me.\n\nI always wanted to help people. But I did not know what job I wanted. In high school and college, I saw people run away from their problems. Some used bad ways to cope. Because of what I saw, I chose to study Psychology. But I still did not know what job to choose. So, after I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One summer day, I met a friend. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy. He was nervous. She said he was there to get away from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the police to his parents’ home. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and told them about my degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak to the parents. The law could not help the boy. I talked to the parents. They seemed nervous. They made excuses and said their son was lying. After this, I thought more about a job in social work. I want to help children with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is also important in social work. We say each person is important, but we still want everyone to be the same. I think it is better to be different. In high school and college, I stood against social injustice. I dyed my hair different colors. I wore clothes that showed who I am. I pierced my ears more than usual. I joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance). I fought against racism and discrimination when I saw it. I believe in social justice. I will keep fighting against social injustice.",
            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model studies genes that are passed down and medical parts of health. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment relates to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review on insomnia talks about these models and explains each study chosen to help understand the models. The research findings are then examined to show their strong and weak points.\n\nA sleep disorder can be a primary sleep disorder, a disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a disorder linked to other problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are linked to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a problem with getting or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is trouble staying awake, both for at least one month. Narcolepsy includes cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and staying asleep, while Parasomnias are related to unusual behaviors or physical happenings during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep problems due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus with orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice showed that there are GABAB receptors on these neurons that control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor helps sleep. If this receptor is stopped from working, it can reduce anxiety and help sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from mice can apply to humans. This shows a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep well without medicine. The sociocultural meaning of this study is that if the trait was inherited, it could affect sleep. Changing the receptor would disturb sleep, which would negatively affect areas like school, work, and daily activities that need focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Moving around campus is a problem for many, including me. In my first year, I lived in a dorm room at East Halls, which is very far east on campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which happens often in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, who said that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large empty land. Now, that space has sports fields, big new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from one place to another becomes harder. What is the best way to solve this problem? On a college campus, the answer is the bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made for bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who started biking again after not doing so for many years. He said he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the best way to get around.\" Biking is good for your body and it is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms. The best thing I did this year was to buy a bike. I have class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The only problem is that Pollock Road is the quickest way to Thomas building from my house, and it is not always easy to travel on, even with a bike. Walking has its good points too, but I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes from my day. That’s more than two and a half hours each week. Add all the other time I would spend walking to other classes and appointments. That’s more time than I can afford.",
            "Aldous Huxley talks about the danger of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people care more about the group than the individual. They are taught to seek quick happiness above all else. The people are controlled by a bigger plan set by the World Controller. When we look at this book with Marxist ideas, we see Huxley's worries about these systems. Words from Marxism like \"false consciousness\" show that Huxley is talking about problems in the economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is made fun of with the idea of false consciousness from Marxism. Regular people do not understand their real class relations because they only care about their own gain. This is because of control over workers, shown in how people are taught in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, have no real will. They are taught to buy and spend through sleep-teaching. The World Controller uses this to control them. Groups are controlled by other groups. Lower classes do not know they are controlled and support the system of capitalism and consumerism. Higher classes know but do little about it. Only some, like Bernard, question their place. The way social classes interact shows the problems of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, there are no real relationships. Characters are not deep, even main ones. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do strong feelings. Interactions are shallow, with men talking about women’s looks and women talking about their encounters. Each class is happy with their place, showing the effect of capitalism. Their total obedience to their role in society shows Marxist ideas about workers who think they are better as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One main topic in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. This question is even more important today. Since 9/11, I have seen the media change. At first, it showed Islam as hostile. Now, it is very tolerant of Islam in America. I think, in 2001, we could not have a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me. What I know about Muhammad's history seems different from the biography. I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam. He would conquer tribes and make them follow Islam. But the biography shows Muhammad as misunderstood and humble. People came to him because they saw truth in his teaching.\n\nThere are similarities between Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. For example, Muhammad took mutton and milk and made it enough for forty men. This writing style makes me think the writers wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet. This is hard for me because it makes Jesus's life and miracles seem less important. It feels like they take credit for Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography try to show how people converted to Islam. But these stories often come from someone who heard it from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true and more suspicious to me.\n\nThe biography tries to show Muhammad as a godly, humble, and gentle man. But history shows something else. I wonder if Muslims today know about the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought developed after his life. If we look at history, we see Christianity moving away from its start. Today, there is more awareness and a new way of thinking. Some people hold on to old beliefs and resist change, but they may not be enough to affect everyone. Among Christians, knowledge of history will grow a lot in the future. People will want to know what was added to Christianity and what Jesus really wanted. This change may take a long time, but it will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will grow, removing added ideas, and going back to what Jesus taught. As this change happens in the United States and Europe, people will worship like in Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will stay strong to lead. But, beliefs and practices will become more alike instead of different. Over time, there have been big changes in history. For example, Christians were once hurt by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became Christian. In our country, we have moved from slavery to leadership for African-Americans. The big change coming will be in the Christian religion, going back to its source, and becoming less diverse. This change will happen by reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, not literal. So what happened since Jesus’ time? If we look back in history, we find only Judaism, which started Christianity. Belief in one God, a revealed religion, and Hebrew scriptures were all important by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united. They divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people.",
            "I think \"The Jungle\" shows that, deep down, people are naturally greedy and self-centered. They care only about themselves and making their lives better. They do not care about people lower than them. \"The Jungle\" shows this in many ways. The main example is the owners and managers of big factories. They want to make their companies as big and great as possible. They do not care who or what gets hurt in their way. \n\nUpton Sinclair describes the pollution from the factories. He writes about big chimneys and smoke going into the sky. Sinclair wants to show the damage from this pollution. He shows that the owners do not care about people or animals who might get hurt. They do not care about the smoke coming from the factories or the waste from the animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They do anything to save or make more money. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" \n\nWorkers have to work long hours. They might lose their jobs without notice or help. During the time of \"The Jungle,\" there were few laws to protect workers. Managers and owners could do what they wanted. Workers had to work fast and in bad conditions. The book shows that workers had to deal with these bad conditions. There were no groups to help them. Unions were formed, but they often hurt more than they helped because they took money from poor workers. \n\nWorkers were treated so badly that they were like slaves. Sinclair writes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" This shows that workers had no escape from the system. They were always close to starvation and depended on cruel men.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe thought it was one of his better works. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott says this word goes back to Virgil. Virgil used \"Thule\" to mean an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this was the edge of the known world. But there is a more recent link to this word. Poe liked German writers. This is important because it shows Poe knew about Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt wrote about Poe and Goethe. He said Poe's poem was like Goethe's work. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust. It was published in two parts, in 1808 and 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" This poem is about a king. His wife dies after giving him a goblet. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses her. He decides to die, gives his things to his children, but keeps the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, and dies. The King of Thule and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are a lot alike. It might show Poe's own feelings of loss.\n\nPoe uses the word \"Thule\" twice in his writings. He first uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He also uses \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as similar works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about Thule. It is dark and lonely. The speaker sees dead friends and a world without color. In Goethe's poem, the king is also lonely after losing his wife. It feels like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was an important writer. Poe likely knew of him. Poe also respected Tennyson. This connection to Tennyson would have led Poe to Goethe’s work. Goethe's work was reproduced many times after it first came out. This is how Poe might have known it.",
            "In California, can a customer who slipped on an applesauce spill in a store get extra money as punishment for the store? The customer must show the manager acted with bad intent. The manager knew about the spill twice but did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge may not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer's request for extra money. To get this money, Palmer must show the manager's actions were done with a willful disregard for harm. She must also show the actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin, the manager, should have known not cleaning the spill was dangerous. Many people had already slipped in the store in the months before Palmer's accident. Even with this knowledge, Martin did not clean the spill. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were very bad is less strong. But it is still possible because six slip-and-fall accidents happened in 2009, and Martin did not keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, told his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was on a dinner break and did not want to deal with it. At 5:15 pm, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and hurt her back badly. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for money to cover her injury and extra money for punishment. We are thinking about asking the court to reject the request for extra money.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money for punishment if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law says malice is when someone intended to cause harm or acted very badly and ignored others' safety. Courts say actions are malicious when the defendant knew the actions were dangerous and still did it. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt like she needed something. This desire could not be satisfied. It started when she was 14, just starting her teenage years. It was still there 3 years later, when she was 17. By now, she thought she wanted someone, not something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys liked her and tried to win her heart, but no one interested her. She often asked herself about this strange feeling, trying to find out why she felt this way. She had some ideas, but nothing clear. So she lived her life, always wondering about her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually calm. Her parents were good and quiet people. They did not argue with each other, and they rarely argued with their daughter. They only argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she had a lively and fun personality. This made her well-liked because she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, trying to find inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. She saw her mother on the ground, in pain, saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter ran to her and tried to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were rushed and tight, and the daughter knew she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Her mother showed her hands, and the daughter was glad she had learned to be strong. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nAt the hospital, there were smells of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she did not notice that, because she was too busy helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother in and called for help.

They took her to be checked right away, and the daughter sat and waited with worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "This study aims to show that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a lower risk of long-term heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a changed version of the Med diet. It includes eating more plant foods, such as plant proteins, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans. It also includes eating more monounsaturated fat (not saturated fat) and fish, and eating less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in small amounts is okay.\n\nEarlier studies found that following a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of death from heart disease. One study showed that the Med diet helped people lose weight better than a low-fat diet. It also lowered the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese people. Past studies did not focus on stroke or deaths from stroke.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of heart disease or diabetes. They were part of the Nurses' Health Study, which included 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to check nutrient intake in the past year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study for 20 years. FFQs were checked for accuracy. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by looking at medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were marked \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use after menopause were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, physical activity during free time was also checked.\n\nTo reduce random differences for a person and better show long-term diet intake, averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use after menopause, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to check the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using different models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher aMed diet score was linked to a lower risk of new CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women with the highest aMed scores had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign says that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of the movie Juno, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head. The unsettling message is written with a marker on her sign. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is controlled by a harsh military group that took power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, there were street protests, the first in ten years. Many Burmese monks led these protests. People called it “The Saffron Revolution,” named for the color of the monks' robes. At first, more people showed interest in the protests. The Burmese government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon the situation became violent. Some saw it as a war between the monks and the military. Soldiers invaded and destroyed monasteries. Foreign reporters were arrested and jailed. A Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, while at a street protest. The official number of deaths is 13. But an army officer, Colonel Hla Win, who left the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to stop protests and keep complete control for a long time. Roman emperors said they were chosen by the gods to rule. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to lead their people. Our current president, George W. Bush, talks every week with Ted Haggard, leader of a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nSome well-known examples of these actions include the 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the government. The death count varies. The Chinese government says 200-300 died. The Chinese Red Cross says 2,000-3,000 died. Another example is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Hutu groups, with help from the Rwandan government, killed many Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme example. During that time, many Jewish people were rounded up and killed.",
            "Duke Ellington is important in jazz because he lived a long time and was very creative. He was good at leading his band. On the piano, Ellington was often subtle, but he was great at writing music. He made complex pieces that showed the skills of his band members. Ellington let soloists improvise, and he also wrote pieces that used the special style of his band members. This made the band sound unique and original. He knew how each player sounded and how they fit together in the band. This helped him write some of the best jazz music.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's sound and new ideas. It mentions Creole Love Call, where he used the voice like a jazz instrument. This was an early example of using voice to add color without words. In Creole Love Call, Ellington showed he could match the style of his soloists. This piece is a slow twelve-bar blues with six parts:\n\n1. First part: Voice and reeds call and respond. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough.\n2. Second part: Muted trumpet plays the melody with blue notes.\n3. Third part: Clarinet solo in high notes, with a soft piano behind it.\n4. Fourth part: The full band echoes the first part with brass and reeds.\n5. Fifth part: The reeds call and respond in high notes, with brass and rhythm backing.\n6. Sixth part: Like the first part, voice and reeds call and respond. The voice uses the “growl” technique.\n\nEnd: A quick vocal run and a strange trombone ending.\n\nEllington used voice to add a new sound. This is a style he used often. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington mixed tight writing with tone color. \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing made a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) shows these ideas more. Ellington used Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that shape how they change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that scientists had hardly begun to describe simple living forms using math, and this is still true today. Recently, math models have been used to study how mollusk shells form over time (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study looks at how math models and experiments can show how and why these changes happen in Prunum. We used X-ray pictures of Prunum to find numbers that help model shell shapes. These numbers were put into a program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We made models of shell shapes to see what changes are possible in Prunum. These results are mixed with studies to learn more about big changes over time in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that moves through space. The turns of the shell are called whorls, and they spiral around a central line called the columella. The size of whorls can change, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one. The spire is all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from the top, bottom, front, and back. Normally, a shell is viewed from the front, with the opening facing the viewer and the top pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first look at the shell from the top and find where the first line begins. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, and estimate to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of these openings by using the center, and the size of each opening.\n\nThis path can be shown in pictures and math. Once you have a math model, you can change the numbers to see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children who die in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years. The country is doing well in reaching some goals, like clean water and toilets. But, it is not doing well in making sure mothers and children are healthier. There are many reasons why this is happening. We need to make the health system stronger instead of only making new programs.\n\nIndonesia has made progress with more babies being born with a trained health worker present. Now, 72% of births have a health worker there. But, this number also includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there is a problem during birth. This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding. So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems, and more work is needed. Also, fewer children under five with diarrhea see a health worker now. We do not have all the information about care for mothers after birth, but it is a concern too, with low numbers across the country.\n\nRates of Cesarean sections are still low, around 4%. There is a problem because 7% of these happen in cities but only 2% happen in rural areas. This shows that healthcare services are mainly in cities. Another problem is that poor people use health services much less than rich people. There is a 27% gap between the poorest and richest groups. The poor find it hard to get healthcare, likely because they have to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nTo make care for mothers and babies better, we need to think about the best way to fix the problem. Should Indonesia make programs just for this issue, or should it make the whole health system better? Making programs for one specific area can seem like a good idea. These programs have clear goals and can show results faster. But there are problems too. Spending a lot on one program can mean less money for other programs. People may leave other areas to work where there is more money, like happened with funding for HIV/AIDS affecting family planning. Also, having many programs for the same thing can mean repeated work and uncoordinated services, leading to more forms and paperwork.",
            "Popular music has changed a lot in the past 100 years. There are now many types of music. It is hard to name them all. Each type, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, has many smaller groups within it. Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most varied and expressive types in the last 40 years. It shows many feelings, often darker ones. It is diverse because people saw it could change. They made new styles from it. This led to even more new styles.\n\nToday, heavy metal has many small groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal is now. It has mixed with other types of music. But, like all things, it started from something. To understand metal music today, we must know what the metal movement is and why it is a movement, not just a type of music.\n\nMetal is a movement known for its dark side. It is a \"music of more\"—more bass, more noise, more intensity, more drama. Metal band members are skilled with their instruments, and it shows. Metal is also known for its link to drugs. In the mid-70s, many people used psychedelic drugs. This led them to make strange and intense music. Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new because much popular music was not dark. Later metal bands took ideas from the Romantic Era. The lyrics show the darkness that is key to metal.\n\nHelter Skelter by The Beatles shows this dark side. It has ups and downs, like a drug experience. Some say it is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show they could be as heavy as The Rolling Stones. They put it on The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists painted dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau made his own dream paintings. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman amazed by the dream world she sees. This painting also shows Rousseau's dreams and hopes as a painter. From the start, he wanted other artists and art lovers to accept and praise him. He faced a hard choice to reach this goal. The Dream shows Rousseau's struggle: should he copy popular art styles to fit in, or be unique and follow his own way?\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware seller. Rousseau had no formal art training. He worked for France in a toll service job until age forty. People wrongly called him a customs worker. His first wife, Clémence, died after losing eight babies, leaving him with one daughter, Julia. Full of sadness, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and new hope. Unlike others who romanticized peasant life, he was a folk painter with simple hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He had no formal training and started painting late. He also painted at the same time as famous artists. He got recognition only when Matisse was becoming known. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse feared being boring, while Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would get him into Artiste Français.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong link between what is good and what is beautiful, between truth and beauty. I think there is a reason for this. In a poem, John Keats says, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful, as Keats suggests, without being taught in these usual ways. Both ideas try to explain rather than tell us what to do. Our study of what is right and what is beautiful is mostly about why a piece of art or writing is good, or why an action is right, rather than rules for making good art or doing good things.\n\nAlso, talking about art or morals can never completely show what is truly good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss things like the front, the back, how colors are used, or the culture it comes from. But these do not fully explain why it is good art. Often, when someone talks about their favorite art or book, they say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed answer. I think art and morals can never be fully explained by their parts. As Flannery O'Connor says, a story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way. Even if we describe all parts of a book, there is still something more. I think the same is true for what is right. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something,\" this hard-to-explain quality, is the strongest part of both art and what is right. This makes a link between the two.\n\nI think art and what is right are closely connected because we feel both deeply, even if we can't fully explain them. This link is even stronger in literature. McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature is important because of the values we find in it, just like in life.",
            "Today, Germany is a strong and united country. It has a unique culture from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also felt in Köln, on the river Rhine, through the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Germany's culture comes from many different sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is called Germania. The name's origin is debated by scholars. Tacitus said it came from a tribe called Tungrians, known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars. He took the word from the Gauls to tell them apart from the tribes he had not conquered. Some think it meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. Caesar wrote about the Germans beyond the Rhine, who often fought the Gauls. Others say the name comes from the spear called a \"ger\" or from an Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" showing Germans as loud.\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote about the Germans in AD 98. He believed they were native to their land and not mixed with others. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its harsh land and weather, unless it was their home.\n\nRomans did not want to live in Germania. They sent expeditions for goods and fought sometimes, but they mostly returned to their empire. In the first century, Germanic tribes lived by the Roman Empire’s borders. They traded goods and served in the Roman army.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while wearing a disguise can help deceive others for a long time, a person must eventually stop pretending. Otherwise, they might lose who they really are. Ending a deception is hard because it can make a person feel alone. So, a person must choose between keeping their true self or keeping their relationships with others. Some people may not mind being tricked, but others may get upset and feel hurt by the deception.\n\nThe issue of pretending to be the opposite gender is difficult. One important question is why someone would hide their true identity this way. For Viola, it is a form of protection. She says: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Viola is in a strange place and thinks she must pretend to be a man to stay safe from danger. Her plan works, but it also cuts her off from the women who could support her. Also, she looks so much like a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Olivia says, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also has to deal with hidden feelings between her and Orsino, who says: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo today’s readers, Twelfth Night may show how deception can reveal hidden feelings, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Some parts suggest these characters might have feelings they do not fully understand until Viola/Cesario makes them face these emotions. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she thinks Cesario is a man, or does she have feelings for women? It seems she does not, as Olivia easily switches her love from Cesario to Sebastian and sees Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German rule in its colonies was often very harsh. This was clear in the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But, not all of the German colonial empire was the same. Each colony had different ways of ruling and teaching. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German schools in Kamerun and other places were also praised by writers of that time.\n\nIn South West Africa, it was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government started schools for Africans, education in South West Africa was mostly left to missions with little help from the government. The government spent a lot on education for Europeans there, building state schools and helping mission schools more. This led to long-term effects. While many Africans in other German colonies could read and write, most in South West Africa could not. Many reasons led to this difference. This paper will look at these reasons and focus on new studies about settler and government views on Africans.\n\nThere are many writings on education in German colonies. Most are in German and were written in the early 1900s. They mainly showed what the school systems were like. Later, English writings compared education in different German colonies and looked at details. These showed big differences in education between colonies. The most important study on this topic is by Cohen. Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared the school systems and explained why they were different. Cohen said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa was a key reason for its unique education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a better climate than other German colonies, though much of it was dry desert. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was more than the 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that had a long rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The main event in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In this war, the United States attacked and defeated Mexico. The United States gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were many other clashes between the two countries. The rivalry slowed down just before the First World War. It began because Americans and Mexicans disagreed on religion, culture, and material interests.  \n\nThis is similar to many countries that have a rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have clashes of interests. This can create rival positions between them. The United States and Mexico are like many other rivalries between countries that share a common border. David M. Pletcher says that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems. Both of these countries are close to the United States. They have been rivals, while other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.  \n\nReligious issues caused a split between the two countries. This problem has affected many countries through history. Sally Frahm says that in the twentieth century, Americans opposed fascism and communism. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy. Like the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, there was an ideological struggle. But this struggle was about religious preferences, not political structure. The distrust came from the distrust between the English and Spanish. This feeling of distrust was a big obstacle in creating friendly relations between the United States and Mexico.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues and border raids from Mexico. There were also problems with outlaws from American border towns. This was a major problem until both countries used military force on their borders.  \n\nSchmitt explains that the rivalry began to slow down as Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States. It ended when American goals changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became disabled by an illness I never knew about. \n\nI was a nurse then. I chose this work because I needed safety and security. I did not have these as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work because people always get sick.\" I heard this many times as I grew up. So, even though I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, I chose nursing. \n\nBut then, at 46 years old, I was single and had no money. I could not work. I am still disabled today. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing that is mine. I get by, but every day is hard. My life is not sure anymore. But one thing is true: I could not have managed without my family and friends. Even strong people need help in hard times. \n\nLife will always have emergencies. There are no guarantees. No matter how prepared you are, some problems are too big to handle alone. \n\nI agree that people in the U.S. should not depend only on big government. It is not steady. But I think we should trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help. We should not just build shelters alone. \n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism.\" But what helped our ancestors was compassion, respect, and sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone. \n\nSo, be ready. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water tablets, and plastic sheets. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned foods. If you can grow and preserve your food, do it. It is a good idea. A wood stove is also good if you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. One day, he would be called Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became wise. His teachings started Buddhism. The oldest form of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about two thousand five hundred years old. It is different now than when Buddha was alive. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a Theravada country. There, people have a yearly water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and other people take part in it. This ceremony has some religious meaning, even though Buddha did not talk about such events. These changes are seen in both the simple traditions and the deep beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist group has changed its ideas over time. This is because of forces from both inside and outside, and some are good while others are not.\n\nThere are some terms we will use often. There is \"internal\" versus \"external.\" An internal force comes from members of the Buddhasasana, whether they are monks or not. An external force is from people who are not Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or wants to harm Buddhists. A benign force does not want to hurt or help Buddhists, but it might do one of these by accident. We will talk about these terms often.\n\nFirst, let us look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, which means three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has deep ideas like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes). By knowing these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth. When Sansara ends, so do lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes wise. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life. For laymen, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly in sex, and do not take drugs or alcohol. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can end."
