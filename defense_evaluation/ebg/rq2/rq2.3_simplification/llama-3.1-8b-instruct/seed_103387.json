            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The sociocultural model looks at how environment, race, and social status affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model says that some people may have genes that affect their sleep. The body's hypothalamus, which controls sleep and wakefulness, has special cells called neurons. These neurons use a substance called orexin to tell the body when to sleep and when to wake up. \n\nOne study tested this idea on mice. It found that there are special receptors in the orexin neurons that help control sleep and wakefulness. If these receptors are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping. A medicine called baclofen can help by activating these receptors and promoting sleep. \n\nThis study helps us understand how genetics and environment affect sleep. If people inherit a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping. This can affect their daily lives, making it hard to focus and do everyday tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how people's environment and social status affect their sleep. This means that people from different backgrounds may have different sleep patterns. For example, people who are stressed or anxious may have trouble sleeping.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be caused by different things. Some people may have primary insomnia, which means they have trouble sleeping. Others may have insomnia because of another mental health problem or because of a medical issue.\n\nPrimary insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping for at least a month. It is not the same as narcolepsy, which is a condition where a person has trouble staying awake. There are also other sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking and nightmares.\n\nThe sociocultural model helps us understand how people's environment and social status affect their sleep.

It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. It has trouble separating words from background noise and differentiating between sounds.\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers looked at children with speaking problems. They began testing these children in 1954. In 1961, a doctor named Kimura created a test to help understand how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD happens in many ways. Some people with CAPD have trouble finding where a sound is coming from. Others have trouble telling two or more sounds apart. They may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or understanding what someone says. They may also have trouble with changes in voice or different sounds. Sometimes, one sound covers up another sound. They may have trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and therapists use observation and tests. These tests can be done by different professionals, including audiologists and speech therapists. They use many different tools to test how well someone hears. These tools include questionnaires, observing how someone responds to sounds, and recording sounds in the ear. There is no one test that works for everyone, and there is no known cause of CAPD.",

It will also look at how European settlers and colonial leaders thought about Africans.\n\nThere are many studies about education in German colonies. Most of these studies are in German and were written a long time ago. They mainly talked about the education systems in the colonies. Later studies compared education in different German colonies. They also looked at specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems were different in different colonies. One study by Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the difference in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate. It was not too hot or too cold. Many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Popular music has changed much in the last 100 years. Many new kinds of music have been added. It is hard to list all the different kinds. Many of these kinds of music have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has a kind called heavy metal. Heavy metal has grown and changed over the last 40 years. It is a strong kind of music that expresses a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal music is special because it is very flexible. People started making their own kinds of heavy metal music soon after it began. They took the basic kind of heavy metal and made new kinds of it. This made even more kinds of heavy metal music. Today, there are many kinds of heavy metal music. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is.\n\nTo understand the many kinds of heavy metal music, we must understand what it is and where it came from. Heavy metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is loud and has strong beats. It often has a wild or crazy sound. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music started during a time when many people were using strong drugs. This made them want to make strange and wild music.\n\nHeavy metal music also has a lot of dark qualities. Many people found this new. Most popular music was happy and light. Heavy metal music is different. Later, people took some ideas from the past and added them to heavy metal music. These ideas were from the Romantic Era, a time when people wrote about strong emotions.\n\nSome songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of heavy metal music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make loud and heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "A long time before the Surrealists painted their strange works, Henri Rousseau made his own dreams come true. He painted his dreams and feelings. One of his paintings is called \"The Dream\". This painting is not just a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. It is also Henri Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be known and liked by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know what to do.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a worker who sold tin and metal things. Growing up, Henri did not learn to paint in school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40. He was a man who helped collect taxes. But people called him a custom's officer. After his first wife died, Henri was very sad. He had eight baby daughters and only one son left. He gave up his old job and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Henri painted every day people and their lives.\n\nHenri wanted to be known by the art world. He started painting late in life and there were many other famous artists at the same time. But he did not get recognition until he was old. Even then, he was not as famous as some other artists. A writer said that Henri and another artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse painted to be new and different. Henri painted to be normal and liked by all.",
            "Many famous thinkers agree that ethics and beauty are connected. I think they are connected at a basic level. John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. However, we often like or dislike ethics and beauty without being taught. Ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful. This is not the same as a set of rules.\n\nWe cannot fully understand what makes something good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss its colors, shapes, and cultural background. But these things do not tell us why it is good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I think art and morals can never be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of literature, there is something more. I think the same is true for ethics.\n\nThe reason ethics and beauty are connected is that we experience them in the same way. We cannot fully explain why something is beautiful or moral. This is especially true for literature. Literature is unique because of its moral quality. It is about values, which are important in life. Literature helps us understand the values we find there.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has its own culture, a mix of many different things. This culture can be found from the mountains of the south to the Baltic Sea in the north. The city of München is in the mountains, while Kiel is near the Baltic Sea. The city of Köln is on the Rhine River, and Dresden is on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture comes from many different places. The country has a long history. Many groups of people lived there before the Romans. These people were called the Germans.\n\nThe name \"Germany\" is not easy to understand. Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians. Others think it comes from a word that means \"spear\". Another idea is that it comes from a word that means \"to shout\". This could mean that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans. He said they were a group of people who lived in the area now called Germany. He said they were not mixed with other groups of people. They lived on the border of the Roman Empire. The Romans would sometimes send armies to fight the Germans for goods and power. But the Romans did not live in Germany. They went back to their own country.\n\nThe Germanic tribes had skills and goods that they traded with the Romans. Some of these tribes became soldiers in the Roman army. They served the Romans and helped them with their battles.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was looking at a picture.  I did not connect the picture to any idea in my head.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was working well.  It felt like I was not thinking.  I was just experiencing what I saw.\n\nA friend who is an artist told me to read a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I wanted to learn to draw.  I wanted to draw when I was six years old.  This book teaches everything about drawing.  It teaches how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simple.  For example, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nI was looking at a bowl in front of me.  I could not think of the square the artist was talking about.  I was too surprised.  I just stood and looked.\n\nSome artists made art in blue, some in green, and some in many colors.  I was starting to make my picture.  I was starting to tell my story.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved.  I was creating something.  Water was flowing smoothly.  It was clear and clean.  Something was breaking apart and disappearing.\n\nI tried to make my hand move again.  But it hit the toilet.  A brown package was stuck in the toilet.  I was very frustrated.\n\nI gripped a mop tightly.  I looked at the brown package.  It was a messy package of food waste.  I looked unhappy.  I thought about flushing the toilet again.  After a while, I took the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like a glove.\n\nI stood up.  I bent down.  I put my hand into the toilet.  I was getting the package out.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things cause this problem.  The US government says one reason is that young brains are not ready for driving.  Young people do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience makes them more likely to have bad accidents, drive too fast, and drive off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more badly when they have friends with them.  A study in California found that the age of passengers and the number of car accidents are connected.\n\nSome states have rules to help make driving safer for young people.  These rules limit how many hours young drivers can drive and do not let other young people ride with them.\n\nBut I think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that young drivers are not good at handling risks.  A psychologist says 18 is too young for a driver's license.  He studied people under 20 and found that they like to take risks for fun.  This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nSoon, many more young people will be able to drive.  This could be very bad.  By 2010, many more teens will be driving.  We need a law to help stop these car accidents.\n\nA good law would be to make schools teach driving classes.  But no one under 18 could drive.  Before getting a full license, young people could get a special permit and practice driving with a grown-up.  The number of practice hours could be the same as in many states, like California.\n\nA national law would be a good idea.  It would help keep young drivers safe all over the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it would be a good way to save lives.",
            "I look at many old films at the Library of Congress. There are fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I study these films to understand how they work. I look at all trick films from this time. Some are fun to watch, but most are not very long. They are usually set in one place and do not have many movements.\n\nMost trick films are like plays. The camera does not move. You see all the actors at the same time. The actors do not come or go from the camera's view. They only move side to side. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" for example, has actors who enter from the right side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not show close-up shots. It only shows long shots or medium shots. This is because the theatre and vaudeville tradition do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time. Most trick films are very short, usually one minute or less. They show short tricks like magic and disappearing. The film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" is an example. It looks like one shot, but it is actually made from several shots.",
            "John Taylor from Virginia was a strong supporter of a government with three parts.  He believed in the rights of the people.  He thought these rights are very important and should not be taken away by the government.  Taylor worked on a farm and in politics.  This made him a good speaker and a strong leader.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that helps people.  He believed in a system where everyone is equal.  He thought this system would not exist in a country with a strong leader.  He wanted to create a new system where people have freedom and rights.\n\nTaylor said government leaders are like other people.  They have good and bad qualities.  He believed a good government protects private property and helps farmers.  It also keeps people from becoming too rich at the cost of others.  Taylor thought self-interest is a natural part of people.  However, it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be small and not have too much power.  He believed a big government is expensive and can be bad.  But he did not want to use a very simple way of reading the Constitution.  He thought this could lead to unfair laws.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was very important.  It said the United States is a group of states, not one country.  He believed this document explained the country's values.",
            "Look at Figure 17. We had a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a problem. We don't know why it happened. In the winter, fewer people ride bikes or walk. This might be one reason for the drop. December is the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and finishing grades. They might forget to fill out the log. December also starts the holiday season. Many students and professors take a month-long break. They don't need to come to campus. Classes start again in January. But even that doesn't explain the low number of logs in February.\n\nWe tried to make the project more exciting with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people to participate again. It worked. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We wanted to know if bigger prizes would help. Maybe a new bike or a hybrid car would get more people to participate. This could have stopped the drop in engagement.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had offered bigger prizes, like a new bike in December and a hybrid car in January, we think more people would have participated. The gift cards were enough at first, but we should have increased them to get more people to join.",
            "An ETF is a kind of investment fund.  It tracks an index or a group of assets.  ETFs are like index funds but more flexible.  They trade on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs give you the benefits of an index fund and a single stock.  You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.  ETFs are also less expensive than average mutual funds.\n\nBut there are some problems with ETFs.  You must pay a fee for each trade.  ETFs offer many choices.  You must decide if these benefits are real and how big they are.\n\nTo study ETFs, we will look at the ETF IHF.  We will compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to know if ETFs are as good as a group of 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks.\n\nWe will not look at all the holdings in the ETF.  Instead, we will look at the top 10, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the total.\n\nTo see how the top 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will calculate their Beta and Return.  This will show us how well the top 10 stocks do compared to the ETF.  We will include these calculations in a chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more money than the ETF.  The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could be a better choice.\n\nBut are these results real?  To find out, we will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks.  This will show us how much risk each stock has.  We will compare their standard deviation to the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land.\" It is one of his best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in this poem. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, who used it to describe an island in the north of Britain. Virgil thought this island was the edge of the known world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writing of German authors. One author he was interested in was Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer from Germany. He wrote a poem called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then again in 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" Goethe wrote about a king who is unhappy after his wife dies. The king drinks a lot and cries about his dead queen. This king is similar to a character in \"Dream-Land.\" Maybe Poe was using this king to describe his own sadness.\n\nGoethe also wrote a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" It is about a king who loses his wife and becomes unhappy. He gives away all his things and throws away a special cup. This is similar to the king in \"Faust.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it again in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. Poe described a place called Thule as dark and lonely. This place is like the world in \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous author. Poe probably knew his work. Poe respected another author named Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe was also exposed to Goethe's work because many people were copying his books.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who slips and falls on an applesauce spill in a store be awarded money because the store manager was very wrong? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. A judge will not quickly reject the customer's claim for extra money.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, must show that the manager acted with bad intent. She must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and still did it anyway. Palmer can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill because many customers had slipped and fallen in the store before. Before Palmer's accident, six people had slipped and fallen in the store.\n\nThe manager, Martin, was told about the spill twice. The first employee told him at 5:00 pm. The second employee told him at 5:15 pm. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She got a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get extra money if the other person was very wrong. This can happen if the other person acted with \"badness\" or \"malice.\" Malice means they intended to cause harm or were very careless and did not care about the safety of others. A court has said that a person acts with malice if they know their actions can cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "I studied Islam at the CBC four years ago. We talked about many things in class, but one big question was: Is Islam a hostile religion? I think this question is still very important today.\n\nAfter 9/11, I saw big changes in the media. They used to say bad things about Islam, but now they often say nice things. It's surprising that a long time ago, America would not have elected a president with a Muslim name like Barack Obama.\n\nI read the story of Muhammad's life. What I know about him is different from what I read. I thought he made people join Islam by force. But the story says he was kind and humble. People came to believe in him because they saw the good in him.\n\nSome things in the story are like the things that happened in Jesus' life. For example, Muhammad fed a group of people with just a little food and had enough for everyone. The writers of the story want us to see Muhammad as a special person who didn't need to prove anything. But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' story.\n\nThe story has many examples of people converting to Islam. But some of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes me not trust the stories as much. I think the writers want us to believe that these stories are true, but it makes me wonder if they are really true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a perfect man. But history says he was not always kind and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and his beliefs in his time were soon forgotten in the growth of Christian thought after his death.  If we look at this history, we see a big change in Christianity moving further and further from its start.  We can see a big change happening today.  Many people are becoming more aware and open to new ideas.  But the old way of thinking will not go away.  Some people will always want to follow the old rules.  They may not be enough to stop the change.  In the future, more people will understand the history of Christianity.  They will want to know what was really said by Jesus.  It will take time, maybe many years.  But it will happen.  There will be a big change in the history of Christianity.  It will go back to its start.  People will remove the ideas that were added over time.  It will be like going back in time.  They will find the true meaning of what Jesus said.  When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas again.  The church will still be strong, but it will be different.  There will be less difference between people who believe in Jesus.  They will be more alike.  This is like what happened in history before.  For example, the Roman Empire used to be against Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders.  This big change will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start and make things more alike.\n\nIf we look back far enough, we find that Christianity started from Judaism.  The core of the Jewish religion was one God, a divinely revealed God, and the Jewish holy books.  But the Jewish people did not all agree.  They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want good things for themselves, but not others. The book shows this in many ways. One way is the owners and managers of large factories. They want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions. According to Upton Sinclair, the book's writer, factories cause a lot of damage to the environment. The air is dirty and animals and people are hurt.\n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. They wanted to make money. They forced workers to work long hours and then fired many workers at the same time without helping them find new jobs. There were no laws to protect workers during that time. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. They made workers work in bad conditions and live in poor neighborhoods. There were no organizations to help workers. Some groups that were supposed to help workers made money from them instead. Workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape their difficult lives. They were described as slaves because they had no control over their lives and were dependent on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a book about the problems in a place called Packingtown. It shows how people were treated unfairly. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they often act badly too. This is what happened in Packingtown. People were poor, hungry, and had no help. They did what they had to do to survive.",
            "Many writers use different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. One method he uses is to pair an adjective with a noun in a way that is not usual. This makes readers think of a certain feeling or idea about the subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this method with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. He gives meaning to these colors and then uses them to make readers remember a feeling about important objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to the colors white and gray. He makes white mean something nice and higher class, and gray mean something old and worn out. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald uses white and gray many times. Everyone in the story wears white, like Daisy and Jordan. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But when he gets an idea about Gatsby's party, he describes the rooms as bright and colorful, not white. Fitzgerald uses white and gray on common things too, like buildings and people. He describes the lower part of New York as \"white chasms.\" He also describes a person's name as a \"gray name.\" \n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to describe ordinary people and places. He says Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" He says the land in the valley of ashes is \"gray.\" He describes a dog seller as an \"old gray man.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers something first with Daisy. After a long time, he describes Daisy wearing white and gray things. This makes readers see her as not very special, but just something that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this method many times to make readers see Daisy as something ordinary. For example, he describes her fur as a \"gray haze.\" He also says she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet. This makes readers think of Daisy as something Gatsby wants, but not very interesting.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops. The climate is sunny and warm. It is good for growing food. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash are some of the crops. Also, people grow peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use organic methods. They use no chemicals to make their food. This makes a lot of demand for organic food in the San Diego area. \n\nMany people want to buy organic eggs and milk from local farms. Some farms also give tours. People can see how food is made. They can also walk in the woods and watch birds. This kind of farm can help the landowner get money from the government. It also helps the environment.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps many kinds of plants and animals. But it can be more expensive than other farming methods. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests. The farmer must also use natural ways to make the soil healthy. This can be expensive. A small farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It takes more work to make the same amount of food.\n\nThe land I chose is near a town called Potrero. It is in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is 160 acres. There are chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is close to the Cleveland National Forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live in this area. Some are endangered. They need our help to survive. The area was home to Native Americans a long time ago. Later, people settled there and raised cows.\n\nI looked at a website to find a real piece of land. I also looked at government programs to help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area. This farm uses natural methods to grow food. It helps the environment and makes money.

            "Culture is important in any talk. A culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere or in one place. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly.\" These statements are too general. To understand a culture, we must know its value. A value is a reason for something.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand. But we must accept a culture as it is. We should not try to change it. \n\nKnowing a culture is not just about history or past events. It is also about what people believe and how they feel. When we go to a place where people have a different culture, we must respect their traditions. This helps us succeed in our talks.\n\nA country's culture is not the only culture. A company can have its own culture too. For example, some companies work many hours. Other companies work fewer hours. We can see a company's culture in how people dress, how they talk, and what they do for their work. Some companies want employees to help charities. Other companies do not.\n\nUnderstanding culture is important. It helps us know why people do things. For example, in some cultures, people want to save face. This means they do not want to lose respect. In other cultures, people value making a good deal. If we know these values, we can do better in our talks.\n\nBefore we talk, we should know some things about the person we are talking to. This helps us do a good job in our talks.

            "The Bible says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is found in Psalm 14. Two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, discussed the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. We will assume both are correct about God for this discussion. This will help us compare their two ideas.\n\nSt. Anselm said we can know God exists by looking inside ourselves. He said we can't think of a time when God didn't exist. We know God exists because we know the truth inside our minds. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can know God exists through reason and evidence. We don't need faith to believe. Aquinas gave five logical reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and order. He said these reasons show that God is necessary. It's like a puzzle: if you see all the other pieces, you can know what the missing piece looks like.",
            "A long time ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince was born. This prince later became known as the Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became a wise man. His teachings started a new religion, called Buddhism. The most traditional part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is more than 2,500 years old. It is different now from when the Buddha was alive. We can see this in many places, for example in Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the 'water-cutting ceremony'. Monks and people who live in the community both participate in this ceremony. It has special meaning, even though the Buddha never taught about a holiday like this. The Theravada Buddhist community has to change its ideas over time. This happens because of internal and external forces. Internal forces come from inside the Buddhist group. External forces come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces are good, some are bad. Some forces are friendly, some are not.\n\nWe need to know some special words. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from people who are not Buddhist. Hostile means something that harms or wants to harm the Buddhist group. Benign means something that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, even if it might happen as a result. We will use these words many times in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to learn the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes three baskets of texts. The first basket has all the teachings of the Buddha. The second basket has rules for behavior. The third basket has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life has suffering, and everything is changing. To stop suffering and death, people need to understand these ideas. When people are enlightened, they will stop suffering and also stop wanting things they do not have and hating others. The Buddha taught rules for living. For people who live in the community, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly with others, and do not take alcohol. For monks, there are more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, our desires cause suffering. Third, we can overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries that had a long rivalry for 57 years. This lasted from 1836 to 1893. Their biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won the war and got Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. This was not the only fight between the two countries. They had many other smaller fights, but they stopped before World War One. \n\nThe rivalry started because of disagreements on important issues like religion, culture, and traditions. The two countries also had different economic interests. This is not unusual. Many countries that share a border have disagreements that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have had a long time of disagreements with a neighbor. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher said in 1977 that the United States has long-lasting problems with Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had disagreements because of their different religions. This is not a new problem. Many countries throughout history have had disagreements because of their religions. Sally Frahm said in 2001 that Americans used to be against Catholicism and monarchy. This was different from their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century. The disagreement between the United States and Mexico was similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, their disagreements were not about politics, but about their different religions. The United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 fights between the United States and Mexico between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from American towns near the border were a big problem until the United States and Mexico used their armies to control the border. \n\nSchmitt said that the rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to end when Mexico needed the United States more. The United States then changed its goals from taking territory to helping Mexico's economy in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I became a nurse because I wanted a steady job. People always get sick, so I thought it would be easy to find work. But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still sick today. I am 46 years old and have no money. I get help from the government, but it is not enough. Every day is hard for me. I am grateful for my family and friends who help me.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Bad things can happen to anyone. No matter how strong you are, you need help sometimes. \n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on the government. But I think we should help each other instead of trying to do everything alone. We should trust and help our neighbors.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" is not true. Our ancestors were able to survive hard times because they helped each other. They did not go through difficult times alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. Have a kit with food, water, and a first aid kit. But also get to know your neighbors. They can help you in an emergency.\n\nIf you have a farm, grow your own food. It is a good idea. But do not forget to help others too.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there rules that affect how they change? A long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain how living things are made using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how mollusks grow their shells. We are doing a study to see if using math to understand how mollusks grow can help us learn about how they change over time.\n\nWe used special pictures of mollusks to find numbers that can help us make math models of their shells. We put these numbers into a computer program to make math models of what the shells could look like. We used these models to see how shells can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around in a circle. It turns 360 degrees in all directions. The turns are called whorls. They are like circles that go around a middle point. The middle point is called the columella.\n\nThe whorls can grow at different speeds. A line that divides each whorl is called a suture. The last whorl is usually the biggest. The other whorls are called the spire.\n\nThe top of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the top of the shell and find where the first line is. We draw a line and count the whorls from there. We can count to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can draw a map of the path using numbers. We can use math to change the map and see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much over the last ten years.  The country is doing well in meeting some of the United Nations' goals, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not improving fast enough in health care for children and mothers to meet its targets.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting more health workers at births.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled health worker.  But, these workers are not always doctors or nurses.  They are sometimes traditional workers like midwives.  These workers cannot give medical help if there are problems during pregnancy.  Many mothers die because of bleeding during childbirth.  The progress in this area is not as good as it seems.\n\nFewer children under five years old are treated for diarrhea by a health professional.  We do not have all the information about care after birth.  But we know that this is a problem.  The rates of care are low across the country.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a cesarean section, which is a medical operation to help the baby come out safely.  Only about 4% of women have cesarean sections.  The rate of cesarean sections is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  We also know that the poor have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, the poor get 27% fewer healthcare services than the rich.  This is because they have to pay out of their own money.\n\nTo improve the health care for babies and mothers, we need to find the best way to solve the problem.  One way is to focus on one area of health care at a time.  This can give us quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  It can take money away from other areas of health care.  It can also make it hard for people to work in other areas because there is not enough money.  Another problem is that when we have many programs working together, they can create too much paperwork and waste money.",
            "Victorian stories are known for their careful details and focus on the rich people of the time.  Two stories that are not like this are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These stories use mystery and strange events.  These things help us know the characters better and understand their feelings and ideas.\n\nIn one part of the story, Oliver Twist, Oliver's mind is full of confusing ideas. He is still thinking about two men, Sikes and Crackit, who are arguing. When he pays attention, he sees that he is talking to them. Then, there is a loud noise and he is moved away quickly. Oliver feels pain and is confused.\n\nThese stories use mystery in strange ways. In Oliver Twist, strange things happen and help us know about Oliver's feelings and the world around him. In one part, Oliver remembers a time when he was shot. He relives the memory like it was a dream. This shows that Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was very sick and did not know what was happening. The pain was always there, and he was very afraid.\n\nThis event makes us wonder who caused Oliver's bad luck. It was not Oliver's fault, so he had no control over what happened. This event also shows that Oliver is giving up. He has lost hope and does not try to change his situation.\n\nIn another part of the story, the author writes: \"The day was short. It was gone as soon as it came. The night was very quiet, but it did not last long.\"",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their schoolwork, but my best subjects were English and reading. One student, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I thought something was strange about his reading problems. Some letters he read well, others not. Adrian's family is from Latin America. He spoke very good English, but I thought he might have trouble with the alphabet.\n\nI met his mother when she came to pick him up from the after-school program. She did not speak English. I helped some with communication, but then I realized Adrian knew how to read. He just did not know the English alphabet very well.\n\nThis story shows us a problem in schools, especially in California. Even if a student speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We need to find a solution. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading helped. But for other students, it is more complicated.\n\nWe need to use many things to help students who do not speak much English. Some ideas are dual language classes, regular classes, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nDual language classes are a good idea. They help students who speak different languages. Children in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that these programs waste money and are not helpful. But that is not true. If we use these programs in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nWe do not need all teachers to be bilingual. That is too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can assist teachers in the classroom.",
            "When we are young, many people tell us that there is something bigger than us. This thing is hard to understand. We can learn about it in Sunday school or other places of worship. Some people believe in the religions their parents teach them. Others do not believe. They think there is no more than what we can see and touch.\n\nA person's beliefs can change over time. This is because we grow and get new ideas. We try to find our own path in life. We want to understand the world and our place in it.\n\nMy father was sick for a long time. He had a disease that hurt him a lot. He got thinner and his hair fell out. One day, we sat on the porch together. It was raining hard. My father looked out into the rain. He looked sad. I was sad too. I did not want to talk about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would make it more painful.\n\nWe sat together, looking at the rain. I wanted to remember my father when he was happy, not when he was sick. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. My father did not want me to see him die. He would not want me to be sad.\n\nAfter my father died, I was very sad. I stayed in bed for three days. I waited for news from my family. But no one called me. I thought about God and why he would make my father suffer so much. I did not pray because I did not think God was listening.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new things. It has both old ideas and new ways of writing. Many people do not like it or do not understand it. Some think it is not deep. Others say it is great because it makes us feel the 'terrible sublime' (a big feeling of fear and wonder).\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was called \"The Castle of Otranto\". It was written by Horace Walpole. He took ideas from old romances and new novels to make a new way of writing. He used old ideas and new ways to create a new style. \n\nThe word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things before. People thought it was old-fashioned. But the Gothic Novel used these old ideas and made something new. It combined old and new in a way that made it popular for a long time.\n\nOne of the main ideas in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of being a brave, honorable, and kind knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto\", this idea is used to show what a true knight should be like. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show what was missing in society. He was unhappy with the state of the world and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past.\n\nIn the novel, a character named Frederic is a good example of a chivalric person. He is a prince who has suffered and is brave. He has many qualities of a true knight. He is kind and courteous. But, this image is also exaggerated, which is a common feature of Gothic Novels.",
            "Supply chain management is a process. It involves moving goods from customers to the raw materials stage, then to production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained the process of planning, doing, and controlling activities in a supply chain. He said this process helps meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain process. The production stage says when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need.\n\nManagers study the market and understand what customers want. Then they decide what to make and how much to make. Next, they decide where to make the products and choose a plant for good quality and high volume. They also think about customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter that, managers plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain process. Every detail matters. If details are not planned, it can cost a lot of time and money.\n\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. There is a plan for employee uniforms and receiving shipments. This plan makes the business work smoothly.\n\nSupply is the second key element. It means making decisions about a company's core skills and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for one product. Each division has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also decide to work with other companies to reduce costs.\n\nThe reason managers outsource work is to be fast and flexible. Being fast and flexible means giving good quality and low costs.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says that Hitler is living there.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a cardboard sign high above her head. The sign has a message written on it in black marker.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A long time ago, a group of military leaders took control of the country. They did not allow people to vote or speak freely. There were many protests in 2007. Many Burmese monks led the protests. The monks wore orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon, the situation became violent. Many people were hurt or killed. Foreign journalists were arrested and put in prison. One journalist from Japan was killed. The government said 13 people were killed. But a high-ranking military officer said many more people were killed. He said, \"Many people have died recently. The number of deaths is in the thousands.\"\n\nThis has happened many times in history. Long ago, some leaders thought they were gods and had complete control over their people. Today, some leaders try to keep people from speaking out against them. A long time ago, the Chinese government stopped a big protest at Tiananmen Square. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But another group said 2,000-3,000 people were killed.\n\nIn another country, Rwanda, a group of people began killing Tutsis and others they did not like. Many people were killed. A long time ago, a man named Hitler led a group that killed many Jews. His group was called the Third Reich.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He had a long career. This helped him make great music with his orchestra. He was good at writing music that showed each musician's skill. Ellington wrote music that allowed each musician to play freely. He also wrote music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington played piano in some of his music. But he was not the only musician. He made sure each musician had a special part in the music. This made the music sound new and exciting. Ellington's music was one of a kind. He was good at writing music that sounded good together.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. They say he used the human voice as a musical instrument. This is shown in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture to the music. He does not use words in this song. He uses the voice like an instrument.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. The first part has a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough. The second part has a muted trumpet solo. The third part has a clarinet solo with a piano phrase. The fourth part is like the first part. The fifth part is the most exciting part. The reeds do the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections make a strong sound. The sixth part is like the first part. But the voice sounds different.\n\nIn the last part, the voice makes a growling sound. This is like a special effect. Ellington liked to use the voice in his music to add color and texture. This is one way he was different from other musicians.\n\nIn another song called Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music that sounds good together. He uses a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This makes a rich and exciting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone to introduce the melody. He chooses a musician who is good at playing the trombone.",
            "She felt something missing. This feeling started when she was 14. It continued three years later when she was 17. She thought she wanted a person, not just anything. But she did not like any boy. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same. She often thought about this strange feeling.\n\nHer life at home was usually quiet. Her parents were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. Her parents also rarely argued with her. They liked her to be independent. She was a happy person and her parents liked her.\n\nBut today was not a quiet day. She heard her mother scream in the kitchen. She ran into the room and said, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother was on the ground, in pain. She said \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter helped her mother and said, \"I will take you to the hospital.\" Her mother told her where to pick her up. Her daughter was happy she had taken classes to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and drove.\n\nThe hospital was a scary place. It smelled bad and made her worried. But she was not worried, only thinking about her mother. She carried her mother to the doctor and called for help. The doctors came and took care of her mother.\n\nHer mother fell off a little stool while getting a vase from high up.",
            "This study showed that eating like people in the Mediterranean area is good for your heart.  This way of eating is called the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet).  A higher \"aMed diet score\" means you eat more foods from plants and fish, and less meat and bad fats.  You can also have a little alcohol.\n\nPast studies showed that eating the Med diet can help you live longer and be healthier.  But these studies did not look at how it affects strokes.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old.  They were part of a bigger study of 121,700 women nurses in 11 US states.  The women answered questions about what they ate for 20 years.  Six times, they filled out a \"food frequency questionnaire\" to tell us what they ate.  Most of the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.  The food questionnaires were checked for accuracy.  When the women got heart disease or a stroke, the study checked medical records to confirm it. \n\nThe study looked at many things that could affect the results.  The study controlled for age, smoking, weight, hormone use, and exercise.  It also looked at how much the women drank and if they took aspirin.\n\nA computer program was used to see if eating like people in the Mediterranean area helps prevent heart disease and stroke.  The study found that women who ate like this had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study followed the women for 20 years.  In this time, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 women had a stroke, and 1077 women died from heart disease or stroke.  Women who ate the most like people in the Mediterranean area were less likely to get heart disease and stroke than women who ate the least like them.  The risk was 71% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States was in big financial trouble. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell. This is still happening today. We must ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it? \n\nThe financial crisis was caused by poor decisions made by leaders in government. They made banks give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened because the financial system was not ready for it. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people did not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. This caused big problems for the whole economy.\n\nThe start of the financial crisis was in 1999. President Clinton wanted to win a second term in office. He wanted to make more people happy with him. To do this, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people. This made it possible for the financial crisis to happen seven years later.\n\nA journalist named Steven Holmes wrote about the problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae was giving loans to people who could not afford them. He also said that this could cause a big problem if the economy slowed down.\n\nMany things worked together to make the financial crisis worse. New types of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used a lot. This made the economy depend too much on the housing market. People and banks borrowed too much money and were not prepared for a change in the housing market.\n\nThe housing market then crashed, and the banks that bought the bad loans were in trouble. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007. This is a lot of money. Some banks were sold cheaply, and others had to be regulated closely. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a bad thing in writing.  It is when you tell too much about a story.  Sometimes it makes readers bored or angry.  Dr. Merlin gets angry when she reads too much exposition.  It is like a bad devil that tells you to tell everything before you start the good parts.\n\nYou know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\"  Dr. Merlin still forgets this rule and writes long parts with nothing happening.  Exposition is when you tell the readers what happened.  In films, one character tells another a lot of information.  In writing, the author does the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says a woman meets a man, they get married, and he dies.  You don't want to read two pages about this.  You want to see how the man loves the woman and how she feels about him.  This makes you care about them and what happens to them.  You would want to know more about the man's character.  How does he talk and act?  How does the woman feel about him?  This helps you understand the story better.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add meat to the story.  You can't just say \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You need to make it interesting.  Sometimes it is hard to do this.  But you must try.  For example, you are introducing a new character.  You know he used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station.  You also know he is married, likes fishing and has a secret dream.  You don't need to tell all this at once.  You can show it through his actions and words.",
            "I watched two news programs on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live on NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. He is named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They only talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly, but no one knew who shot him. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed before that when minorities are hurt, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is hurt, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot by a bullet from a small rifle. The police want you to call if you know who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot, but then it would rain. They wanted to make you stay tuned to the news to find out more.\n\nThey also told a story about a store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man, who was wearing a hood, robbed the store. They talked about how dark he was, which seemed unusual.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez from Texas. He was a big drug dealer. He was sent to prison for 25 years for selling marijuana. They also said he was a Hispanic man, but that was not important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and hard to break. It includes many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see themselves. In bad situations, the true nature of this connection shows itself. It can be good or bad. When we understand these feelings, we must face the bad things that come with them. We see ourselves in our brother. We see our true character in our actions and the results of those actions.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey to the countryside. The author describes the land very well. Bitter disappointment and strong pride come together in a big scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows the readers how the brother with the disability feels through his actions and talks.\n\nThe brother's actions are all because of one main feeling: pride. From the start, the brother wants a brother who can do all the things he can do. He wants a brother to play with and to be friends with. But the little brother cannot do these things. He is very sick and cannot play like other children. The big brother is very angry and disappointed. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when the little brother smiles, he feels happy. This shows that the big brother loves his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and learn. As technology gets better, we use better words to describe the brain. In the past, we compared it to a flat piece of wax, then a piece of paper, and then a book. Now, we compare it to a computer.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These senses are like special helpers that take in things like touch, heat, sound, and light. They turn these things into special signals. The brain then changes these signals many times. This makes it easier to understand the information.\n\nWhen we look at something, the brain works in two ways. One way is from the bottom up. This means it takes small pieces of information and makes them into bigger pieces. For example, when we look at a black box on white paper, the brain uses small pieces of information like color and shape to decide that it is a box. The other way is from the top down. This means it uses what we already know to understand the information. This helps us learn things faster.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. This is like a choice. We don't notice small things like the blades of grass when we look at our shoes. But when we hear our name in a loud place, we listen carefully.\n\nThe brain has many steps to process information. It stores what we learn in different kinds of memory. There are three main kinds: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information. This means it changes the information into a way that the brain can understand. For example, if we hear a word, the brain can change it into how it sounds, how it looks, or what it means.\n\nThe brain also has to keep the information we learn. It does this by sending a special signal to the right neurons. Some studies on animals show that this signal helps us remember things for a short time. We keep long-term memories in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes what we know. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a web. Each idea is a node, and the nodes are connected to each other if they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in the book Brave New World. He is worried about how technology and a system called capitalism can hurt people. In this world, people put the community first and are taught to be happy all the time. But, the people are really just being controlled. They do not have a choice.\n\nThe people in this world are like pawns in a game. They are told what to think and believe. A person in charge, called the World Controller, makes all the decisions. \n\nIf we look at the book from a certain point of view called Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley does not like the way people are treated. He uses special words from this theory to show how he feels. For example, he talks about how people are the same and how they are changed into what they are meant to be.\n\nHuxley also criticizes capitalism. He says that people do not know the truth about how the system works. They are too busy thinking about their own happiness. The people in control make sure the common people do not know about the real problems. They control the people through a special sleep teaching method called hypnopædia. This makes people want to buy and spend money all the time.\n\nThe lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They do what they are told. The people in charge use a system called hegemony to control them. This means that one group of people has power over all the others. The upper classes know this, but they do not do anything to stop it. Only a few characters in the book, like Bernard, try to understand what is happening.\n\nThe people in Brave New World do not have real relationships. They do not know each other deeply. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's freedom to make choices and express themselves. The people in this world do not love each other or feel strong emotions. They only talk about physical things, like how someone looks.\n\nThe people in this world are happy to be where they are in the system. This shows how capitalism can make people obey and not question the system. This is what Marxist theory says about the people who work but do not have power.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years now. Getting around campus can be hard for many people. My first year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is far from the center of campus. To go to class in the Willard building, I had to walk a long way. It took up to 25 minutes to walk, especially when the weather is bad. Some time ago, the area near East Halls was empty land. The school built new sports fields and big buildings there. It is now full of apartments. As the campus grows, it is harder to get from one place to another. The best way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students and the school need to make sure the campus is safe for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding a bike again. He said it is a great way to travel. He said it was not cool to ride a bike for a few years, but now it is the best way to get around. Riding a bike is good for your body and it is fast. You can go 30 miles or more with just eating a simple meal and exercising a little. I live off campus now, which is far from the center of campus. I decided to buy a bike and it was the best decision I made this year. It takes 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas building. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. I have to be careful because Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also good, but I am too busy. If I did not have my bike, I would have to walk to class every day. It would take 30-40 minutes extra every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have time for that."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at two models that help us understand the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health. The sociocultural model looks at how environment, race, and social status affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model says that some people may have genes that affect their sleep. The body's hypothalamus, which controls sleep and wakefulness, has special cells called neurons. These neurons use a substance called orexin to tell the body when to sleep and when to wake up. \n\nOne study tested this idea on mice. It found that there are special receptors in the orexin neurons that help control sleep and wakefulness. If these receptors are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping. A medicine called baclofen can help by activating these receptors and promoting sleep. \n\nThis study helps us understand how genetics and environment affect sleep. If people inherit a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping. This can affect their daily lives, making it hard to focus and do everyday tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how people's environment and social status affect their sleep. This means that people from different backgrounds may have different sleep patterns. For example, people who are stressed or anxious may have trouble sleeping.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be caused by different things. Some people may have primary insomnia, which means they have trouble sleeping. Others may have insomnia because of another mental health problem or because of a medical issue.\n\nPrimary insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping for at least a month. It is not the same as narcolepsy, which is a condition where a person has trouble staying awake. There are also other sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking and nightmares.\n\nThe sociocultural model helps us understand how people's environment and social status affect their sleep.

            "This paper talks about three parts of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we look at what CAPD is. Next, we explain how to find out if someone has CAPD. Finally, we talk about how teachers can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. It has trouble separating words from background noise and differentiating between sounds.\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers looked at children with speaking problems. They began testing these children in 1954. In 1961, a doctor named Kimura created a test to help understand how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD happens in many ways. Some people with CAPD have trouble finding where a sound is coming from. Others have trouble telling two or more sounds apart. They may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or understanding what someone says. They may also have trouble with changes in voice or different sounds. Sometimes, one sound covers up another sound. They may have trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and therapists use observation and tests. These tests can be done by different professionals, including audiologists and speech therapists. They use many different tools to test how well someone hears. These tools include questionnaires, observing how someone responds to sounds, and recording sounds in the ear. There is no one test that works for everyone, and there is no known cause of CAPD.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful for a long time. But in the end, a person must stop using the disguise, or they may lose themselves forever. It can be hard to stop a lie. A person may lose the friends they have.\n\nTwelfth Night also talks about a big problem. When a person pretends to be someone else, it can cause trouble with people around them. Some people will not be angry when they find out they were tricked. But others will be very angry.\n\nThis play also talks about being a man or a woman. A main character, Viola, pretends to be a man. She does this to protect herself from people who might harm her. Viola's plan works, but she loses her friends who are women.\n\nViola meets a lady named Olivia. Olivia thinks Viola is a man named Sebastian. Olivia falls in love with Viola. Viola also has feelings for Orsino, but she cannot show them. This is because Viola is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows that sometimes people may have feelings they do not show. Olivia and Orsino may have hidden feelings. This is because they see Viola, who is pretending to be a man. One reason for this is that Olivia may only like people based on how they look. \n\nThis is clear when Olivia stops loving Cesario (Viola) and starts to love Sebastian. She now sees Cesario as a sister, not a love interest. This shows that Olivia is not serious about her love for Cesario.",
            "German rule was very cruel. It is known for its bad treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. This is not the only case. The German colonial rule was different in different places. The German colonial rule had different policies and ways of ruling in different areas. Education in the colonies was also different.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. However, South West Africa (Namibia) was different. The government did not help much with education for the local people. Missionary groups had to do most of the work. The government spent a lot on education for Europeans. They built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools.\n\nThese choices had long-term effects on South West Africa. Many other German colonies had many educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. They were not literate. Many things caused this difference. This paper will look at these things. It will also look at how European settlers and colonial leaders thought about Africans.\n\nThere are many studies about education in German colonies. Most of these studies are in German and were written a long time ago. They mainly talked about the education systems in the colonies. Later studies compared education in different German colonies. They also looked at specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems were different in different colonies. One study by Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the difference in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate. It was not too hot or too cold. Many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Popular music has changed much in the last 100 years. Many new kinds of music have been added. It is hard to list all the different kinds. Many of these kinds of music have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has a kind called heavy metal. Heavy metal has grown and changed over the last 40 years. It is a strong kind of music that expresses a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal music is special because it is very flexible. People started making their own kinds of heavy metal music soon after it began. They took the basic kind of heavy metal and made new kinds of it. This made even more kinds of heavy metal music. Today, there are many kinds of heavy metal music. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is.\n\nTo understand the many kinds of heavy metal music, we must understand what it is and where it came from. Heavy metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is loud and has strong beats. It often has a wild or crazy sound. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music started during a time when many people were using strong drugs. This made them want to make strange and wild music.\n\nHeavy metal music also has a lot of dark qualities. Many people found this new. Most popular music was happy and light. Heavy metal music is different. Later, people took some ideas from the past and added them to heavy metal music. These ideas were from the Romantic Era, a time when people wrote about strong emotions.\n\nSome songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of heavy metal music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make loud and heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "A long time before the Surrealists painted their strange works, Henri Rousseau made his own dreams come true. He painted his dreams and feelings. One of his paintings is called \"The Dream\". This painting is not just a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. It is also Henri Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be known and liked by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know what to do.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a worker who sold tin and metal things. Growing up, Henri did not learn to paint in school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40. He was a man who helped collect taxes. But people called him a custom's officer. After his first wife died, Henri was very sad. He had eight baby daughters and only one son left. He gave up his old job and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Henri painted every day people and their lives.\n\nHenri wanted to be known by the art world. He started painting late in life and there were many other famous artists at the same time. But he did not get recognition until he was old. Even then, he was not as famous as some other artists. A writer said that Henri and another artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse painted to be new and different. Henri painted to be normal and liked by all.",
            "Many famous thinkers agree that ethics and beauty are connected. I think they are connected at a basic level. John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. However, we often like or dislike ethics and beauty without being taught. Ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful. This is not the same as a set of rules.\n\nWe cannot fully understand what makes something good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss its colors, shapes, and cultural background. But these things do not tell us why it is good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I think art and morals can never be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of literature, there is something more. I think the same is true for ethics.\n\nThe reason ethics and beauty are connected is that we experience them in the same way. We cannot fully explain why something is beautiful or moral. This is especially true for literature. Literature is unique because of its moral quality. It is about values, which are important in life. Literature helps us understand the values we find there.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has its own culture, a mix of many different things. This culture can be found from the mountains of the south to the Baltic Sea in the north. The city of München is in the mountains, while Kiel is near the Baltic Sea. The city of Köln is on the Rhine River, and Dresden is on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture comes from many different places. The country has a long history. Many groups of people lived there before the Romans. These people were called the Germans.\n\nThe name \"Germany\" is not easy to understand. Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians. Others think it comes from a word that means \"spear\". Another idea is that it comes from a word that means \"to shout\". This could mean that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans. He said they were a group of people who lived in the area now called Germany. He said they were not mixed with other groups of people. They lived on the border of the Roman Empire. The Romans would sometimes send armies to fight the Germans for goods and power. But the Romans did not live in Germany. They went back to their own country.\n\nThe Germanic tribes had skills and goods that they traded with the Romans. Some of these tribes became soldiers in the Roman army. They served the Romans and helped them with their battles.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was looking at a picture.  I did not connect the picture to any idea in my head.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was working well.  It felt like I was not thinking.  I was just experiencing what I saw.\n\nA friend who is an artist told me to read a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I wanted to learn to draw.  I wanted to draw when I was six years old.  This book teaches everything about drawing.  It teaches how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simple.  For example, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nI was looking at a bowl in front of me.  I could not think of the square the artist was talking about.  I was too surprised.  I just stood and looked.\n\nSome artists made art in blue, some in green, and some in many colors.  I was starting to make my picture.  I was starting to tell my story.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved.  I was creating something.  Water was flowing smoothly.  It was clear and clean.  Something was breaking apart and disappearing.\n\nI tried to make my hand move again.  But it hit the toilet.  A brown package was stuck in the toilet.  I was very frustrated.\n\nI gripped a mop tightly.  I looked at the brown package.  It was a messy package of food waste.  I looked unhappy.  I thought about flushing the toilet again.  After a while, I took the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like a glove.\n\nI stood up.  I bent down.  I put my hand into the toilet.  I was getting the package out.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things cause this problem.  The US government says one reason is that young brains are not ready for driving.  Young people do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience makes them more likely to have bad accidents, drive too fast, and drive off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more badly when they have friends with them.  A study in California found that the age of passengers and the number of car accidents are connected.\n\nSome states have rules to help make driving safer for young people.  These rules limit how many hours young drivers can drive and do not let other young people ride with them.\n\nBut I think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that young drivers are not good at handling risks.  A psychologist says 18 is too young for a driver's license.  He studied people under 20 and found that they like to take risks for fun.  This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nSoon, many more young people will be able to drive.  This could be very bad.  By 2010, many more teens will be driving.  We need a law to help stop these car accidents.\n\nA good law would be to make schools teach driving classes.  But no one under 18 could drive.  Before getting a full license, young people could get a special permit and practice driving with a grown-up.  The number of practice hours could be the same as in many states, like California.\n\nA national law would be a good idea.  It would help keep young drivers safe all over the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it would be a good way to save lives.",
            "I look at many old films at the Library of Congress. There are fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I study these films to understand how they work. I look at all trick films from this time. Some are fun to watch, but most are not very long. They are usually set in one place and do not have many movements.\n\nMost trick films are like plays. The camera does not move. You see all the actors at the same time. The actors do not come or go from the camera's view. They only move side to side. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" for example, has actors who enter from the right side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not show close-up shots. It only shows long shots or medium shots. This is because the theatre and vaudeville tradition do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time. Most trick films are very short, usually one minute or less. They show short tricks like magic and disappearing. The film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" is an example. It looks like one shot, but it is actually made from several shots.",

He thought these rights are very important and should not be taken away by the government.  Taylor worked on a farm and in politics.  This made him a good speaker and a strong leader.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that helps people.  He believed in a system where everyone is equal.  He thought this system would not exist in a country with a strong leader.  He wanted to create a new system where people have freedom and rights.\n\nTaylor said government leaders are like other people.  They have good and bad qualities.  He believed a good government protects private property and helps farmers.  It also keeps people from becoming too rich at the cost of others.  Taylor thought self-interest is a natural part of people.  However, it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be small and not have too much power.  He believed a big government is expensive and can be bad.  But he did not want to use a very simple way of reading the Constitution.  He thought this could lead to unfair laws.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was very important.  It said the United States is a group of states, not one country.  He believed this document explained the country's values.",
            "Look at Figure 17. We had a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a problem. We don't know why it happened. In the winter, fewer people ride bikes or walk. This might be one reason for the drop. December is the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and finishing grades. They might forget to fill out the log. December also starts the holiday season. Many students and professors take a month-long break. They don't need to come to campus. Classes start again in January. But even that doesn't explain the low number of logs in February.\n\nWe tried to make the project more exciting with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people to participate again. It worked. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We wanted to know if bigger prizes would help. Maybe a new bike or a hybrid car would get more people to participate. This could have stopped the drop in engagement.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had offered bigger prizes, like a new bike in December and a hybrid car in January, we think more people would have participated. The gift cards were enough at first, but we should have increased them to get more people to join.",
            "An ETF is a kind of investment fund.  It tracks an index or a group of assets.  ETFs are like index funds but more flexible.  They trade on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs give you the benefits of an index fund and a single stock.  You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.  ETFs are also less expensive than average mutual funds.\n\nBut there are some problems with ETFs.  You must pay a fee for each trade.  ETFs offer many choices.  You must decide if these benefits are real and how big they are.\n\nTo study ETFs, we will look at the ETF IHF.  We will compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to know if ETFs are as good as a group of 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks.\n\nWe will not look at all the holdings in the ETF.  Instead, we will look at the top 10, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the total.\n\nTo see how the top 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will calculate their Beta and Return.  This will show us how well the top 10 stocks do compared to the ETF.  We will include these calculations in a chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more money than the ETF.  The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could be a better choice.\n\nBut are these results real?  To find out, we will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks.  This will show us how much risk each stock has.  We will compare their standard deviation to the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land.\" It is one of his best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in this poem. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, who used it to describe an island in the north of Britain. Virgil thought this island was the edge of the known world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writing of German authors. One author he was interested in was Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer from Germany. He wrote a poem called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then again in 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" Goethe wrote about a king who is unhappy after his wife dies. The king drinks a lot and cries about his dead queen. This king is similar to a character in \"Dream-Land.\" Maybe Poe was using this king to describe his own sadness.\n\nGoethe also wrote a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" It is about a king who loses his wife and becomes unhappy. He gives away all his things and throws away a special cup. This is similar to the king in \"Faust.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it again in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. Poe described a place called Thule as dark and lonely. This place is like the world in \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous author. Poe probably knew his work. Poe respected another author named Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe was also exposed to Goethe's work because many people were copying his books.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who slips and falls on an applesauce spill in a store be awarded money because the store manager was very wrong? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. A judge will not quickly reject the customer's claim for extra money.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, must show that the manager acted with bad intent. She must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and still did it anyway. Palmer can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill because many customers had slipped and fallen in the store before. Before Palmer's accident, six people had slipped and fallen in the store.\n\nThe manager, Martin, was told about the spill twice. The first employee told him at 5:00 pm. The second employee told him at 5:15 pm. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She got a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get extra money if the other person was very wrong. This can happen if the other person acted with \"badness\" or \"malice.\" Malice means they intended to cause harm or were very careless and did not care about the safety of others. A court has said that a person acts with malice if they know their actions can cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",

I think this question is still very important today.\n\nAfter 9/11, I saw big changes in the media. They used to say bad things about Islam, but now they often say nice things. It's surprising that a long time ago, America would not have elected a president with a Muslim name like Barack Obama.\n\nI read the story of Muhammad's life. What I know about him is different from what I read. I thought he made people join Islam by force. But the story says he was kind and humble. People came to believe in him because they saw the good in him.\n\nSome things in the story are like the things that happened in Jesus' life. For example, Muhammad fed a group of people with just a little food and had enough for everyone. The writers of the story want us to see Muhammad as a special person who didn't need to prove anything. But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' story.\n\nThe story has many examples of people converting to Islam. But some of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes me not trust the stories as much. I think the writers want us to believe that these stories are true, but it makes me wonder if they are really true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a perfect man. But history says he was not always kind and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and his beliefs in his time were soon forgotten in the growth of Christian thought after his death.  If we look at this history, we see a big change in Christianity moving further and further from its start.  We can see a big change happening today.  Many people are becoming more aware and open to new ideas.  But the old way of thinking will not go away.  Some people will always want to follow the old rules.  They may not be enough to stop the change.  In the future, more people will understand the history of Christianity.  They will want to know what was really said by Jesus.  It will take time, maybe many years.  But it will happen.  There will be a big change in the history of Christianity.  It will go back to its start.  People will remove the ideas that were added over time.  It will be like going back in time.  They will find the true meaning of what Jesus said.  When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas again.  The church will still be strong, but it will be different.  There will be less difference between people who believe in Jesus.  They will be more alike.  This is like what happened in history before.  For example, the Roman Empire used to be against Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders.  This big change will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start and make things more alike.\n\nIf we look back far enough, we find that Christianity started from Judaism.  The core of the Jewish religion was one God, a divinely revealed God, and the Jewish holy books.  But the Jewish people did not all agree.  They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want good things for themselves, but not others. The book shows this in many ways. One way is the owners and managers of large factories. They want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions. According to Upton Sinclair, the book's writer, factories cause a lot of damage to the environment. The air is dirty and animals and people are hurt.\n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. They wanted to make money. They forced workers to work long hours and then fired many workers at the same time without helping them find new jobs. There were no laws to protect workers during that time. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. They made workers work in bad conditions and live in poor neighborhoods. There were no organizations to help workers. Some groups that were supposed to help workers made money from them instead. Workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape their difficult lives. They were described as slaves because they had no control over their lives and were dependent on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a book about the problems in a place called Packingtown. It shows how people were treated unfairly. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they often act badly too. This is what happened in Packingtown. People were poor, hungry, and had no help. They did what they had to do to survive.",
            "Many writers use different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. One method he uses is to pair an adjective with a noun in a way that is not usual. This makes readers think of a certain feeling or idea about the subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this method with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. He gives meaning to these colors and then uses them to make readers remember a feeling about important objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to the colors white and gray. He makes white mean something nice and higher class, and gray mean something old and worn out. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald uses white and gray many times. Everyone in the story wears white, like Daisy and Jordan. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But when he gets an idea about Gatsby's party, he describes the rooms as bright and colorful, not white. Fitzgerald uses white and gray on common things too, like buildings and people. He describes the lower part of New York as \"white chasms.\" He also describes a person's name as a \"gray name.\" \n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to describe ordinary people and places. He says Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" He says the land in the valley of ashes is \"gray.\" He describes a dog seller as an \"old gray man.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers something first with Daisy. After a long time, he describes Daisy wearing white and gray things. This makes readers see her as not very special, but just something that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this method many times to make readers see Daisy as something ordinary. For example, he describes her fur as a \"gray haze.\" He also says she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet. This makes readers think of Daisy as something Gatsby wants, but not very interesting.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops. The climate is sunny and warm. It is good for growing food. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash are some of the crops. Also, people grow peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use organic methods. They use no chemicals to make their food. This makes a lot of demand for organic food in the San Diego area. \n\nMany people want to buy organic eggs and milk from local farms. Some farms also give tours. People can see how food is made. They can also walk in the woods and watch birds. This kind of farm can help the landowner get money from the government. It also helps the environment.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps many kinds of plants and animals. But it can be more expensive than other farming methods. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests. The farmer must also use natural ways to make the soil healthy. This can be expensive. A small farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It takes more work to make the same amount of food.\n\nThe land I chose is near a town called Potrero. It is in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is 160 acres. There are chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is close to the Cleveland National Forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live in this area. Some are endangered. They need our help to survive. The area was home to Native Americans a long time ago. Later, people settled there and raised cows.\n\nI looked at a website to find a real piece of land. I also looked at government programs to help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area. This farm uses natural methods to grow food. It helps the environment and makes money.

            "Culture is important in any talk. A culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere or in one place. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly.\" These statements are too general. To understand a culture, we must know its value. A value is a reason for something.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand. But we must accept a culture as it is. We should not try to change it. \n\nKnowing a culture is not just about history or past events. It is also about what people believe and how they feel. When we go to a place where people have a different culture, we must respect their traditions. This helps us succeed in our talks.\n\nA country's culture is not the only culture. A company can have its own culture too. For example, some companies work many hours. Other companies work fewer hours. We can see a company's culture in how people dress, how they talk, and what they do for their work. Some companies want employees to help charities. Other companies do not.\n\nUnderstanding culture is important. It helps us know why people do things. For example, in some cultures, people want to save face. This means they do not want to lose respect. In other cultures, people value making a good deal. If we know these values, we can do better in our talks.\n\nBefore we talk, we should know some things about the person we are talking to. This helps us do a good job in our talks. But we must also know something about ourselves. This helps us understand the other person better.",
            "The Bible says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is found in Psalm 14. Two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, discussed the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. We will assume both are correct about God for this discussion. This will help us compare their two ideas.\n\nSt. Anselm said we can know God exists by looking inside ourselves. He said we can't think of a time when God didn't exist. We know God exists because we know the truth inside our minds. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can know God exists through reason and evidence. We don't need faith to believe. Aquinas gave five logical reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and order. He said these reasons show that God is necessary. It's like a puzzle: if you see all the other pieces, you can know what the missing piece looks like.",
            "A long time ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince was born. This prince later became known as the Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became a wise man. His teachings started a new religion, called Buddhism. The most traditional part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is more than 2,500 years old. It is different now from when the Buddha was alive. We can see this in many places, for example in Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the 'water-cutting ceremony'. Monks and people who live in the community both participate in this ceremony. It has special meaning, even though the Buddha never taught about a holiday like this. The Theravada Buddhist community has to change its ideas over time. This happens because of internal and external forces. Internal forces come from inside the Buddhist group. External forces come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces are good, some are bad. Some forces are friendly, some are not.\n\nWe need to know some special words. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from people who are not Buddhist. Hostile means something that harms or wants to harm the Buddhist group. Benign means something that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, even if it might happen as a result. We will use these words many times in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to learn the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes three baskets of texts. The first basket has all the teachings of the Buddha. The second basket has rules for behavior. The third basket has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life has suffering, and everything is changing. To stop suffering and death, people need to understand these ideas. When people are enlightened, they will stop suffering and also stop wanting things they do not have and hating others. The Buddha taught rules for living. For people who live in the community, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly with others, and do not take alcohol. For monks, there are more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, our desires cause suffering. Third, we can overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries that had a long rivalry for 57 years. This lasted from 1836 to 1893. Their biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won the war and got Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. This was not the only fight between the two countries. They had many other smaller fights, but they stopped before World War One. \n\nThe rivalry started because of disagreements on important issues like religion, culture, and traditions. The two countries also had different economic interests. This is not unusual. Many countries that share a border have disagreements that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have had a long time of disagreements with a neighbor. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher said in 1977 that the United States has long-lasting problems with Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had disagreements because of their different religions. This is not a new problem. Many countries throughout history have had disagreements because of their religions. Sally Frahm said in 2001 that Americans used to be against Catholicism and monarchy. This was different from their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century. The disagreement between the United States and Mexico was similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, their disagreements were not about politics, but about their different religions. The United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 fights between the United States and Mexico between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from American towns near the border were a big problem until the United States and Mexico used their armies to control the border. \n\nSchmitt said that the rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to end when Mexico needed the United States more. The United States then changed its goals from taking territory to helping Mexico's economy in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I became a nurse because I wanted a steady job. People always get sick, so I thought it would be easy to find work. But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still sick today. I am 46 years old and have no money. I get help from the government, but it is not enough. Every day is hard for me. I am grateful for my family and friends who help me.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Bad things can happen to anyone. No matter how strong you are, you need help sometimes. \n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on the government. But I think we should help each other instead of trying to do everything alone. We should trust and help our neighbors.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" is not true. Our ancestors were able to survive hard times because they helped each other. They did not go through difficult times alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. Have a kit with food, water, and a first aid kit. But also get to know your neighbors. They can help you in an emergency.\n\nIf you have a farm, grow your own food. It is a good idea. But do not forget to help others too.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there rules that affect how they change? A long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain how living things are made using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how mollusks grow their shells. We are doing a study to see if using math to understand how mollusks grow can help us learn about how they change over time.\n\nWe used special pictures of mollusks to find numbers that can help us make math models of their shells. We put these numbers into a computer program to make math models of what the shells could look like. We used these models to see how shells can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around in a circle. It turns 360 degrees in all directions. The turns are called whorls. They are like circles that go around a middle point. The middle point is called the columella.\n\nThe whorls can grow at different speeds. A line that divides each whorl is called a suture. The last whorl is usually the biggest. The other whorls are called the spire.\n\nThe top of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the top of the shell and find where the first line is. We draw a line and count the whorls from there. We can count to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can draw a map of the path using numbers. We can use math to change the map and see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much over the last ten years.  The country is doing well in meeting some of the United Nations' goals, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not improving fast enough in health care for children and mothers to meet its targets.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting more health workers at births.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled health worker.  But, these workers are not always doctors or nurses.  They are sometimes traditional workers like midwives.  These workers cannot give medical help if there are problems during pregnancy.  Many mothers die because of bleeding during childbirth.  The progress in this area is not as good as it seems.\n\nFewer children under five years old are treated for diarrhea by a health professional.  We do not have all the information about care after birth.  But we know that this is a problem.  The rates of care are low across the country.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a cesarean section, which is a medical operation to help the baby come out safely.  Only about 4% of women have cesarean sections.  The rate of cesarean sections is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  We also know that the poor have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, the poor get 27% fewer healthcare services than the rich.  This is because they have to pay out of their own money.\n\nTo improve the health care for babies and mothers, we need to find the best way to solve the problem.  One way is to focus on one area of health care at a time.  This can give us quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  It can take money away from other areas of health care.  It can also make it hard for people to work in other areas because there is not enough money.  Another problem is that when we have many programs working together, they can create too much paperwork and waste money.",
            "Victorian stories are known for their careful details and focus on the rich people of the time.  Two stories that are not like this are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These stories use mystery and strange events.  These things help us know the characters better and understand their feelings and ideas.\n\nIn one part of the story, Oliver Twist, Oliver's mind is full of confusing ideas. He is still thinking about two men, Sikes and Crackit, who are arguing. When he pays attention, he sees that he is talking to them. Then, there is a loud noise and he is moved away quickly. Oliver feels pain and is confused.\n\nThese stories use mystery in strange ways. In Oliver Twist, strange things happen and help us know about Oliver's feelings and the world around him. In one part, Oliver remembers a time when he was shot. He relives the memory like it was a dream. This shows that Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was very sick and did not know what was happening. The pain was always there, and he was very afraid.\n\nThis event makes us wonder who caused Oliver's bad luck. It was not Oliver's fault, so he had no control over what happened. This event also shows that Oliver is giving up. He has lost hope and does not try to change his situation.\n\nIn another part of the story, the author writes: \"The day was short. It was gone as soon as it came. The night was very quiet, but it did not last long.\"",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their schoolwork, but my best subjects were English and reading. One student, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I thought something was strange about his reading problems. Some letters he read well, others not. Adrian's family is from Latin America. He spoke very good English, but I thought he might have trouble with the alphabet.\n\nI met his mother when she came to pick him up from the after-school program. She did not speak English. I helped some with communication, but then I realized Adrian knew how to read. He just did not know the English alphabet very well.\n\nThis story shows us a problem in schools, especially in California. Even if a student speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We need to find a solution. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading helped. But for other students, it is more complicated.\n\nWe need to use many things to help students who do not speak much English. Some ideas are dual language classes, regular classes, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nDual language classes are a good idea. They help students who speak different languages. Children in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that these programs waste money and are not helpful. But that is not true. If we use these programs in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nWe do not need all teachers to be bilingual. That is too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can assist teachers in the classroom.",
            "When we are young, many people tell us that there is something bigger than us. This thing is hard to understand. We can learn about it in Sunday school or other places of worship. Some people believe in the religions their parents teach them. Others do not believe. They think there is no more than what we can see and touch.\n\nA person's beliefs can change over time. This is because we grow and get new ideas. We try to find our own path in life. We want to understand the world and our place in it.\n\nMy father was sick for a long time. He had a disease that hurt him a lot. He got thinner and his hair fell out. One day, we sat on the porch together. It was raining hard. My father looked out into the rain. He looked sad. I was sad too. I did not want to talk about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would make it more painful.\n\nWe sat together, looking at the rain. I wanted to remember my father when he was happy, not when he was sick. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. My father did not want me to see him die. He would not want me to be sad.\n\nAfter my father died, I was very sad. I stayed in bed for three days. I waited for news from my family. But no one called me. I thought about God and why he would make my father suffer so much. I did not pray because I did not think God was listening.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new things. It has both old ideas and new ways of writing. Many people do not like it or do not understand it. Some think it is not deep. Others say it is great because it makes us feel the 'terrible sublime' (a big feeling of fear and wonder).\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was called \"The Castle of Otranto\". It was written by Horace Walpole. He took ideas from old romances and new novels to make a new way of writing. He used old ideas and new ways to create a new style. \n\nThe word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things before. People thought it was old-fashioned. But the Gothic Novel used these old ideas and made something new. It combined old and new in a way that made it popular for a long time.\n\nOne of the main ideas in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of being a brave, honorable, and kind knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto\", this idea is used to show what a true knight should be like. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show what was missing in society. He was unhappy with the state of the world and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past.\n\nIn the novel, a character named Frederic is a good example of a chivalric person. He is a prince who has suffered and is brave. He has many qualities of a true knight. He is kind and courteous. But, this image is also exaggerated, which is a common feature of Gothic Novels.",
            "Supply chain management is a process. It involves moving goods from customers to the raw materials stage, then to production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained the process of planning, doing, and controlling activities in a supply chain. He said this process helps meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain process. The production stage says when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need.\n\nManagers study the market and understand what customers want. Then they decide what to make and how much to make. Next, they decide where to make the products and choose a plant for good quality and high volume. They also think about customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter that, managers plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain process. Every detail matters. If details are not planned, it can cost a lot of time and money.\n\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. There is a plan for employee uniforms and receiving shipments. This plan makes the business work smoothly.\n\nSupply is the second key element. It means making decisions about a company's core skills and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for one product. Each division has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also decide to work with other companies to reduce costs.\n\nThe reason managers outsource work is to be fast and flexible. Being fast and flexible means giving good quality and low costs.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says that Hitler is living there.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a cardboard sign high above her head. The sign has a message written on it in black marker.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A long time ago, a group of military leaders took control of the country. They did not allow people to vote or speak freely. There were many protests in 2007. Many Burmese monks led the protests. The monks wore orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon, the situation became violent. Many people were hurt or killed. Foreign journalists were arrested and put in prison. One journalist from Japan was killed. The government said 13 people were killed. But a high-ranking military officer said many more people were killed. He said, \"Many people have died recently. The number of deaths is in the thousands.\"\n\nThis has happened many times in history. Long ago, some leaders thought they were gods and had complete control over their people. Today, some leaders try to keep people from speaking out against them. A long time ago, the Chinese government stopped a big protest at Tiananmen Square. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But another group said 2,000-3,000 people were killed.\n\nIn another country, Rwanda, a group of people began killing Tutsis and others they did not like. Many people were killed. A long time ago, a man named Hitler led a group that killed many Jews. His group was called the Third Reich.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He had a long career. This helped him make great music with his orchestra. He was good at writing music that showed each musician's skill. Ellington wrote music that allowed each musician to play freely. He also wrote music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington played piano in some of his music. But he was not the only musician. He made sure each musician had a special part in the music. This made the music sound new and exciting. Ellington's music was one of a kind. He was good at writing music that sounded good together.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. They say he used the human voice as a musical instrument. This is shown in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture to the music. He does not use words in this song. He uses the voice like an instrument.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. The first part has a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough. The second part has a muted trumpet solo. The third part has a clarinet solo with a piano phrase. The fourth part is like the first part. The fifth part is the most exciting part. The reeds do the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections make a strong sound. The sixth part is like the first part. But the voice sounds different.\n\nIn the last part, the voice makes a growling sound. This is like a special effect. Ellington liked to use the voice in his music to add color and texture. This is one way he was different from other musicians.\n\nIn another song called Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music that sounds good together. He uses a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This makes a rich and exciting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone to introduce the melody. He chooses a musician who is good at playing the trombone.",
            "She felt something missing. This feeling started when she was 14. It continued three years later when she was 17. She thought she wanted a person, not just anything. But she did not like any boy. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same. She often thought about this strange feeling.\n\nHer life at home was usually quiet. Her parents were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. Her parents also rarely argued with her. They liked her to be independent. She was a happy person and her parents liked her.\n\nBut today was not a quiet day. She heard her mother scream in the kitchen. She ran into the room and said, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother was on the ground, in pain. She said \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter helped her mother and said, \"I will take you to the hospital.\" Her mother told her where to pick her up. Her daughter was happy she had taken classes to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and drove.\n\nThe hospital was a scary place. It smelled bad and made her worried. But she was not worried, only thinking about her mother. She carried her mother to the doctor and called for help. The doctors came and took care of her mother.\n\nHer mother fell off a little stool while getting a vase from high up.",
            "This study showed that eating like people in the Mediterranean area is good for your heart.  This way of eating is called the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet).  A higher \"aMed diet score\" means you eat more foods from plants and fish, and less meat and bad fats.  You can also have a little alcohol.\n\nPast studies showed that eating the Med diet can help you live longer and be healthier.  But these studies did not look at how it affects strokes.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old.  They were part of a bigger study of 121,700 women nurses in 11 US states.  The women answered questions about what they ate for 20 years.  Six times, they filled out a \"food frequency questionnaire\" to tell us what they ate.  Most of the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.  The food questionnaires were checked for accuracy.  When the women got heart disease or a stroke, the study checked medical records to confirm it. \n\nThe study looked at many things that could affect the results.  The study controlled for age, smoking, weight, hormone use, and exercise.  It also looked at how much the women drank and if they took aspirin.\n\nA computer program was used to see if eating like people in the Mediterranean area helps prevent heart disease and stroke.  The study found that women who ate like this had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study followed the women for 20 years.  In this time, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 women had a stroke, and 1077 women died from heart disease or stroke.  Women who ate the most like people in the Mediterranean area were less likely to get heart disease and stroke than women who ate the least like them.  The risk was 71% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States was in big financial trouble. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell. This is still happening today. We must ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it? \n\nThe financial crisis was caused by poor decisions made by leaders in government. They made banks give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened because the financial system was not ready for it. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people did not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. This caused big problems for the whole economy.\n\nThe start of the financial crisis was in 1999. President Clinton wanted to win a second term in office. He wanted to make more people happy with him. To do this, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people. This made it possible for the financial crisis to happen seven years later.\n\nA journalist named Steven Holmes wrote about the problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae was giving loans to people who could not afford them. He also said that this could cause a big problem if the economy slowed down.\n\nMany things worked together to make the financial crisis worse. New types of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used a lot. This made the economy depend too much on the housing market. People and banks borrowed too much money and were not prepared for a change in the housing market.\n\nThe housing market then crashed, and the banks that bought the bad loans were in trouble. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007. This is a lot of money. Some banks were sold cheaply, and others had to be regulated closely. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a bad thing in writing.  It is when you tell too much about a story.  Sometimes it makes readers bored or angry.  Dr. Merlin gets angry when she reads too much exposition.  It is like a bad devil that tells you to tell everything before you start the good parts.\n\nYou know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\"  Dr. Merlin still forgets this rule and writes long parts with nothing happening.  Exposition is when you tell the readers what happened.  In films, one character tells another a lot of information.  In writing, the author does the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says a woman meets a man, they get married, and he dies.  You don't want to read two pages about this.  You want to see how the man loves the woman and how she feels about him.  This makes you care about them and what happens to them.  You would want to know more about the man's character.  How does he talk and act?  How does the woman feel about him?  This helps you understand the story better.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add meat to the story.  You can't just say \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You need to make it interesting.  Sometimes it is hard to do this.  But you must try.  For example, you are introducing a new character.  You know he used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station.  You also know he is married, likes fishing and has a secret dream.  You don't need to tell all this at once.  You can show it through his actions and words.",
            "I watched two news programs on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live on NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. He is named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They only talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly, but no one knew who shot him. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed before that when minorities are hurt, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is hurt, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot by a bullet from a small rifle. The police want you to call if you know who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot, but then it would rain. They wanted to make you stay tuned to the news to find out more.\n\nThey also told a story about a store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man, who was wearing a hood, robbed the store. They talked about how dark he was, which seemed unusual.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez from Texas. He was a big drug dealer. He was sent to prison for 25 years for selling marijuana. They also said he was a Hispanic man, but that was not important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and hard to break. It includes many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see themselves. In bad situations, the true nature of this connection shows itself. It can be good or bad. When we understand these feelings, we must face the bad things that come with them. We see ourselves in our brother. We see our true character in our actions and the results of those actions.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey to the countryside. The author describes the land very well. Bitter disappointment and strong pride come together in a big scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows the readers how the brother with the disability feels through his actions and talks.\n\nThe brother's actions are all because of one main feeling: pride. From the start, the brother wants a brother who can do all the things he can do. He wants a brother to play with and to be friends with. But the little brother cannot do these things. He is very sick and cannot play like other children. The big brother is very angry and disappointed. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when the little brother smiles, he feels happy. This shows that the big brother loves his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and learn. As technology gets better, we use better words to describe the brain. In the past, we compared it to a flat piece of wax, then a piece of paper, and then a book. Now, we compare it to a computer.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These senses are like special helpers that take in things like touch, heat, sound, and light. They turn these things into special signals. The brain then changes these signals many times. This makes it easier to understand the information.\n\nWhen we look at something, the brain works in two ways. One way is from the bottom up. This means it takes small pieces of information and makes them into bigger pieces. For example, when we look at a black box on white paper, the brain uses small pieces of information like color and shape to decide that it is a box. The other way is from the top down. This means it uses what we already know to understand the information. This helps us learn things faster.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. This is like a choice. We don't notice small things like the blades of grass when we look at our shoes. But when we hear our name in a loud place, we listen carefully.\n\nThe brain has many steps to process information. It stores what we learn in different kinds of memory. There are three main kinds: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information. This means it changes the information into a way that the brain can understand. For example, if we hear a word, the brain can change it into how it sounds, how it looks, or what it means.\n\nThe brain also has to keep the information we learn. It does this by sending a special signal to the right neurons. Some studies on animals show that this signal helps us remember things for a short time. We keep long-term memories in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes what we know. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a web. Each idea is a node, and the nodes are connected to each other if they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in the book Brave New World. He is worried about how technology and a system called capitalism can hurt people. In this world, people put the community first and are taught to be happy all the time. But, the people are really just being controlled. They do not have a choice.\n\nThe people in this world are like pawns in a game. They are told what to think and believe. A person in charge, called the World Controller, makes all the decisions. \n\nIf we look at the book from a certain point of view called Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley does not like the way people are treated. He uses special words from this theory to show how he feels. For example, he talks about how people are the same and how they are changed into what they are meant to be.\n\nHuxley also criticizes capitalism. He says that people do not know the truth about how the system works. They are too busy thinking about their own happiness. The people in control make sure the common people do not know about the real problems. They control the people through a special sleep teaching method called hypnopædia. This makes people want to buy and spend money all the time.\n\nThe lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They do what they are told. The people in charge use a system called hegemony to control them. This means that one group of people has power over all the others. The upper classes know this, but they do not do anything to stop it. Only a few characters in the book, like Bernard, try to understand what is happening.\n\nThe people in Brave New World do not have real relationships. They do not know each other deeply. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's freedom to make choices and express themselves. The people in this world do not love each other or feel strong emotions. They only talk about physical things, like how someone looks.\n\nThe people in this world are happy to be where they are in the system. This shows how capitalism can make people obey and not question the system. This is what Marxist theory says about the people who work but do not have power.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years now. Getting around campus can be hard for many people. My first year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is far from the center of campus. To go to class in the Willard building, I had to walk a long way. It took up to 25 minutes to walk, especially when the weather is bad. Some time ago, the area near East Halls was empty land. The school built new sports fields and big buildings there. It is now full of apartments. As the campus grows, it is harder to get from one place to another. The best way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students and the school need to make sure the campus is safe for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding a bike again. He said it is a great way to travel. He said it was not cool to ride a bike for a few years, but now it is the best way to get around. Riding a bike is good for your body and it is fast. You can go 30 miles or more with just eating a simple meal and exercising a little. I live off campus now, which is far from the center of campus. I decided to buy a bike and it was the best decision I made this year. It takes 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas building. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. I have to be careful because Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also good, but I am too busy. If I did not have my bike, I would have to walk to class every day. It would take 30-40 minutes extra every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have time for that."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at two models that help us understand the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health. The sociocultural model looks at how environment, race, and social status affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model says that some people may have genes that affect their sleep. The body's hypothalamus, which controls sleep and wakefulness, has special cells called neurons. These neurons use a substance called orexin to tell the body when to sleep and when to wake up. \n\nOne study tested this idea on mice. It found that there are special receptors in the orexin neurons that help control sleep and wakefulness. If these receptors are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping. A medicine called baclofen can help by activating these receptors and promoting sleep. \n\nThis study helps us understand how genetics and environment affect sleep. If people inherit a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping. This can affect their daily lives, making it hard to focus and do everyday tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how people's environment and social status affect their sleep. This means that people from different backgrounds may have different sleep patterns. For example, people who are stressed or anxious may have trouble sleeping.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be caused by different things. Some people may have primary insomnia, which means they have trouble sleeping. Others may have insomnia because of another mental health problem or because of a medical issue.\n\nPrimary insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping for at least a month. It is not the same as narcolepsy, which is a condition where a person has trouble staying awake. There are also other sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking and nightmares.\n\nThe sociocultural model helps us understand how people's environment and social status affect their sleep.

Finally, we talk about how teachers can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. It has trouble separating words from background noise and differentiating between sounds.\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers looked at children with speaking problems. They began testing these children in 1954. In 1961, a doctor named Kimura created a test to help understand how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD happens in many ways. Some people with CAPD have trouble finding where a sound is coming from. Others have trouble telling two or more sounds apart. They may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or understanding what someone says. They may also have trouble with changes in voice or different sounds. Sometimes, one sound covers up another sound. They may have trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and therapists use observation and tests. These tests can be done by different professionals, including audiologists and speech therapists. They use many different tools to test how well someone hears. These tools include questionnaires, observing how someone responds to sounds, and recording sounds in the ear. There is no one test that works for everyone, and there is no known cause of CAPD.",

The German colonial rule was different in different places. The German colonial rule had different policies and ways of ruling in different areas. Education in the colonies was also different.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found many educated Africans. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. However, South West Africa (Namibia) was different. The government did not help much with education for the local people.

They built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools.\n\nThese choices had long-term effects on South West Africa. Many other German colonies had many educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. They were not literate. Many things caused this difference. This paper will look at these things. It will also look at how European settlers and colonial leaders thought about Africans.\n\nThere are many studies about education in German colonies. Most of these studies are in German and were written a long time ago. They mainly talked about the education systems in the colonies. Later studies compared education in different German colonies. They also looked at specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems were different in different colonies. One study by Cohen looked at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the difference in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate. It was not too hot or too cold. Many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Popular music has changed much in the last 100 years. Many new kinds of music have been added. It is hard to list all the different kinds. Many of these kinds of music have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has a kind called heavy metal. Heavy metal has grown and changed over the last 40 years. It is a strong kind of music that expresses a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal music is special because it is very flexible. People started making their own kinds of heavy metal music soon after it began. They took the basic kind of heavy metal and made new kinds of it. This made even more kinds of heavy metal music. Today, there are many kinds of heavy metal music. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is.\n\nTo understand the many kinds of heavy metal music, we must understand what it is and where it came from. Heavy metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is loud and has strong beats. It often has a wild or crazy sound. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music started during a time when many people were using strong drugs. This made them want to make strange and wild music.\n\nHeavy metal music also has a lot of dark qualities. Many people found this new. Most popular music was happy and light. Heavy metal music is different. Later, people took some ideas from the past and added them to heavy metal music. These ideas were from the Romantic Era, a time when people wrote about strong emotions.\n\nSome songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of heavy metal music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make loud and heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "A long time before the Surrealists painted their strange works, Henri Rousseau made his own dreams come true. He painted his dreams and feelings. One of his paintings is called \"The Dream\". This painting is not just a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. It is also Henri Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be known and liked by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know what to do.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a worker who sold tin and metal things. Growing up, Henri did not learn to paint in school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40. He was a man who helped collect taxes. But people called him a custom's officer. After his first wife died, Henri was very sad. He had eight baby daughters and only one son left. He gave up his old job and started painting to feel better. Unlike other artists of his time, Henri painted every day people and their lives.\n\nHenri wanted to be known by the art world. He started painting late in life and there were many other famous artists at the same time. But he did not get recognition until he was old. Even then, he was not as famous as some other artists. A writer said that Henri and another artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse painted to be new and different. Henri painted to be normal and liked by all.",
            "Many famous thinkers agree that ethics and beauty are connected. I think they are connected at a basic level. John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. However, we often like or dislike ethics and beauty without being taught. Ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful. This is not the same as a set of rules.\n\nWe cannot fully understand what makes something good or beautiful. For example, when we talk about da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might discuss its colors, shapes, and cultural background. But these things do not tell us why it is good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I think art and morals can never be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of literature, there is something more. I think the same is true for ethics.\n\nThe reason ethics and beauty are connected is that we experience them in the same way. We cannot fully explain why something is beautiful or moral. This is especially true for literature. Literature is unique because of its moral quality. It is about values, which are important in life. Literature helps us understand the values we find there.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has its own culture, a mix of many different things. This culture can be found from the mountains of the south to the Baltic Sea in the north. The city of München is in the mountains, while Kiel is near the Baltic Sea. The city of Köln is on the Rhine River, and Dresden is on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture comes from many different places. The country has a long history. Many groups of people lived there before the Romans. These people were called the Germans.\n\nThe name \"Germany\" is not easy to understand. Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians. Others think it comes from a word that means \"spear\". Another idea is that it comes from a word that means \"to shout\". This could mean that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans. He said they were a group of people who lived in the area now called Germany. He said they were not mixed with other groups of people. They lived on the border of the Roman Empire. The Romans would sometimes send armies to fight the Germans for goods and power. But the Romans did not live in Germany. They went back to their own country.\n\nThe Germanic tribes had skills and goods that they traded with the Romans. Some of these tribes became soldiers in the Roman army. They served the Romans and helped them with their battles.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was looking at a picture.  I did not connect the picture to any idea in my head.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was working well.  It felt like I was not thinking.  I was just experiencing what I saw.\n\nA friend who is an artist told me to read a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I wanted to learn to draw.  I wanted to draw when I was six years old.  This book teaches everything about drawing.  It teaches how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simple.  For example, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen becomes just a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nI was looking at a bowl in front of me.  I could not think of the square the artist was talking about.  I was too surprised.  I just stood and looked.\n\nSome artists made art in blue, some in green, and some in many colors.  I was starting to make my picture.  I was starting to tell my story.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved.  I was creating something.  Water was flowing smoothly.  It was clear and clean.  Something was breaking apart and disappearing.\n\nI tried to make my hand move again.  But it hit the toilet.  A brown package was stuck in the toilet.  I was very frustrated.\n\nI gripped a mop tightly.  I looked at the brown package.  It was a messy package of food waste.  I looked unhappy.  I thought about flushing the toilet again.  After a while, I took the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like a glove.\n\nI stood up.  I bent down.  I put my hand into the toilet.  I was getting the package out.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things cause this problem.  The US government says one reason is that young brains are not ready for driving.  Young people do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience makes them more likely to have bad accidents, drive too fast, and drive off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more badly when they have friends with them.  A study in California found that the age of passengers and the number of car accidents are connected.\n\nSome states have rules to help make driving safer for young people.  These rules limit how many hours young drivers can drive and do not let other young people ride with them.\n\nBut I think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that young drivers are not good at handling risks.  A psychologist says 18 is too young for a driver's license.  He studied people under 20 and found that they like to take risks for fun.  This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nSoon, many more young people will be able to drive.  This could be very bad.  By 2010, many more teens will be driving.  We need a law to help stop these car accidents.\n\nA good law would be to make schools teach driving classes.  But no one under 18 could drive.  Before getting a full license, young people could get a special permit and practice driving with a grown-up.  The number of practice hours could be the same as in many states, like California.\n\nA national law would be a good idea.  It would help keep young drivers safe all over the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it would be a good way to save lives.",
            "I look at many old films at the Library of Congress. There are fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use special editing to make illusions. I study these films to understand how they work. I look at all trick films from this time. Some are fun to watch, but most are not very long. They are usually set in one place and do not have many movements.\n\nMost trick films are like plays. The camera does not move. You see all the actors at the same time. The actors do not come or go from the camera's view. They only move side to side. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" for example, has actors who enter from the right side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not show close-up shots. It only shows long shots or medium shots. This is because the theatre and vaudeville tradition do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time. Most trick films are very short, usually one minute or less. They show short tricks like magic and disappearing. The film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" is an example. It looks like one shot, but it is actually made from several shots.",
            "John Taylor from Virginia was a strong supporter of a government with three parts.  He believed in the rights of the people.  He thought these rights are very important and should not be taken away by the government.  Taylor worked on a farm and in politics.  This made him a good speaker and a strong leader.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that helps people.  He believed in a system where everyone is equal.  He thought this system would not exist in a country with a strong leader.  He wanted to create a new system where people have freedom and rights.\n\nTaylor said government leaders are like other people.  They have good and bad qualities.  He believed a good government protects private property and helps farmers.  It also keeps people from becoming too rich at the cost of others.  Taylor thought self-interest is a natural part of people.  However, it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be small and not have too much power.  He believed a big government is expensive and can be bad.  But he did not want to use a very simple way of reading the Constitution.  He thought this could lead to unfair laws.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was very important.  It said the United States is a group of states, not one country.  He believed this document explained the country's values.",
            "Look at Figure 17. We had a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a problem. We don't know why it happened. In the winter, fewer people ride bikes or walk. This might be one reason for the drop. December is the end of the fall semester. People are busy with schoolwork and finishing grades. They might forget to fill out the log. December also starts the holiday season. Many students and professors take a month-long break. They don't need to come to campus. Classes start again in January. But even that doesn't explain the low number of logs in February.\n\nWe tried to make the project more exciting with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people to participate again. It worked. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We wanted to know if bigger prizes would help. Maybe a new bike or a hybrid car would get more people to participate. This could have stopped the drop in engagement.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had offered bigger prizes, like a new bike in December and a hybrid car in January, we think more people would have participated. The gift cards were enough at first, but we should have increased them to get more people to join.",
            "An ETF is a kind of investment fund.  It tracks an index or a group of assets.  ETFs are like index funds but more flexible.  They trade on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs give you the benefits of an index fund and a single stock.  You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.  ETFs are also less expensive than average mutual funds.\n\nBut there are some problems with ETFs.  You must pay a fee for each trade.  ETFs offer many choices.  You must decide if these benefits are real and how big they are.\n\nTo study ETFs, we will look at the ETF IHF.  We will compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to know if ETFs are as good as a group of 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks.\n\nWe will not look at all the holdings in the ETF.  Instead, we will look at the top 10, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the total.\n\nTo see how the top 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will calculate their Beta and Return.  This will show us how well the top 10 stocks do compared to the ETF.  We will include these calculations in a chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more money than the ETF.  The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could be a better choice.\n\nBut are these results real?  To find out, we will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks.  This will show us how much risk each stock has.  We will compare their standard deviation to the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land.\" It is one of his best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in this poem. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, who used it to describe an island in the north of Britain. Virgil thought this island was the edge of the known world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writing of German authors. One author he was interested in was Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer from Germany. He wrote a poem called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then again in 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" Goethe wrote about a king who is unhappy after his wife dies. The king drinks a lot and cries about his dead queen. This king is similar to a character in \"Dream-Land.\" Maybe Poe was using this king to describe his own sadness.\n\nGoethe also wrote a poem called \"The King of Thule.\" It is about a king who loses his wife and becomes unhappy. He gives away all his things and throws away a special cup. This is similar to the king in \"Faust.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it again in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. Poe described a place called Thule as dark and lonely. This place is like the world in \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous author. Poe probably knew his work. Poe respected another author named Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe was also exposed to Goethe's work because many people were copying his books.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who slips and falls on an applesauce spill in a store be awarded money because the store manager was very wrong? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill but did not clean it up for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. A judge will not quickly reject the customer's claim for extra money.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, must show that the manager acted with bad intent. She must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and still did it anyway. Palmer can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill because many customers had slipped and fallen in the store before. Before Palmer's accident, six people had slipped and fallen in the store.\n\nThe manager, Martin, was told about the spill twice. The first employee told him at 5:00 pm. The second employee told him at 5:15 pm. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She got a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get extra money if the other person was very wrong. This can happen if the other person acted with \"badness\" or \"malice.\" Malice means they intended to cause harm or were very careless and did not care about the safety of others. A court has said that a person acts with malice if they know their actions can cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "I studied Islam at the CBC four years ago. We talked about many things in class, but one big question was: Is Islam a hostile religion? I think this question is still very important today.\n\nAfter 9/11, I saw big changes in the media. They used to say bad things about Islam, but now they often say nice things. It's surprising that a long time ago, America would not have elected a president with a Muslim name like Barack Obama.\n\nI read the story of Muhammad's life. What I know about him is different from what I read. I thought he made people join Islam by force. But the story says he was kind and humble. People came to believe in him because they saw the good in him.\n\nSome things in the story are like the things that happened in Jesus' life. For example, Muhammad fed a group of people with just a little food and had enough for everyone. The writers of the story want us to see Muhammad as a special person who didn't need to prove anything. But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' story.\n\nThe story has many examples of people converting to Islam. But some of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes me not trust the stories as much. I think the writers want us to believe that these stories are true, but it makes me wonder if they are really true.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a perfect man. But history says he was not always kind and humble. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and his beliefs in his time were soon forgotten in the growth of Christian thought after his death.  If we look at this history, we see a big change in Christianity moving further and further from its start.  We can see a big change happening today.  Many people are becoming more aware and open to new ideas.  But the old way of thinking will not go away.  Some people will always want to follow the old rules.  They may not be enough to stop the change.  In the future, more people will understand the history of Christianity.  They will want to know what was really said by Jesus.  It will take time, maybe many years.  But it will happen.  There will be a big change in the history of Christianity.  It will go back to its start.  People will remove the ideas that were added over time.  It will be like going back in time.  They will find the true meaning of what Jesus said.  When this change happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas again.  The church will still be strong, but it will be different.  There will be less difference between people who believe in Jesus.  They will be more alike.  This is like what happened in history before.  For example, the Roman Empire used to be against Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders.  This big change will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start and make things more alike.\n\nIf we look back far enough, we find that Christianity started from Judaism.  The core of the Jewish religion was one God, a divinely revealed God, and the Jewish holy books.  But the Jewish people did not all agree.  They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and regular people.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want good things for themselves, but not others. The book shows this in many ways. One way is the owners and managers of large factories. They want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions. According to Upton Sinclair, the book's writer, factories cause a lot of damage to the environment. The air is dirty and animals and people are hurt.\n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. They wanted to make money. They forced workers to work long hours and then fired many workers at the same time without helping them find new jobs. There were no laws to protect workers during that time. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. They made workers work in bad conditions and live in poor neighborhoods. There were no organizations to help workers. Some groups that were supposed to help workers made money from them instead. Workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape their difficult lives. They were described as slaves because they had no control over their lives and were dependent on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a book about the problems in a place called Packingtown. It shows how people were treated unfairly. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they often act badly too. This is what happened in Packingtown. People were poor, hungry, and had no help. They did what they had to do to survive.",
            "Many writers use different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. One method he uses is to pair an adjective with a noun in a way that is not usual. This makes readers think of a certain feeling or idea about the subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this method with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. He gives meaning to these colors and then uses them to make readers remember a feeling about important objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meaning to the colors white and gray. He makes white mean something nice and higher class, and gray mean something old and worn out. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald uses white and gray many times. Everyone in the story wears white, like Daisy and Jordan. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But when he gets an idea about Gatsby's party, he describes the rooms as bright and colorful, not white. Fitzgerald uses white and gray on common things too, like buildings and people. He describes the lower part of New York as \"white chasms.\" He also describes a person's name as a \"gray name.\" \n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to describe ordinary people and places. He says Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" He says the land in the valley of ashes is \"gray.\" He describes a dog seller as an \"old gray man.\" Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers something first with Daisy. After a long time, he describes Daisy wearing white and gray things. This makes readers see her as not very special, but just something that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this method many times to make readers see Daisy as something ordinary. For example, he describes her fur as a \"gray haze.\" He also says she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet. This makes readers think of Daisy as something Gatsby wants, but not very interesting.",
            "San Diego County grows many crops. The climate is sunny and warm. It is good for growing food. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash are some of the crops. Also, people grow peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use organic methods. They use no chemicals to make their food. This makes a lot of demand for organic food in the San Diego area. \n\nMany people want to buy organic eggs and milk from local farms. Some farms also give tours. People can see how food is made. They can also walk in the woods and watch birds. This kind of farm can help the landowner get money from the government. It also helps the environment.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps many kinds of plants and animals. But it can be more expensive than other farming methods. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests. The farmer must also use natural ways to make the soil healthy. This can be expensive. A small farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It takes more work to make the same amount of food.\n\nThe land I chose is near a town called Potrero. It is in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is 160 acres. There are chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is close to the Cleveland National Forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live in this area. Some are endangered. They need our help to survive. The area was home to Native Americans a long time ago. Later, people settled there and raised cows.\n\nI looked at a website to find a real piece of land. I also looked at government programs to help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area. This farm uses natural methods to grow food. It helps the environment and makes money.

            "Culture is important in any talk. A culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere or in one place. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are friendly.\" These statements are too general. To understand a culture, we must know its value. A value is a reason for something.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand. But we must accept a culture as it is. We should not try to change it. \n\nKnowing a culture is not just about history or past events. It is also about what people believe and how they feel. When we go to a place where people have a different culture, we must respect their traditions. This helps us succeed in our talks.\n\nA country's culture is not the only culture. A company can have its own culture too. For example, some companies work many hours. Other companies work fewer hours. We can see a company's culture in how people dress, how they talk, and what they do for their work. Some companies want employees to help charities. Other companies do not.\n\nUnderstanding culture is important. It helps us know why people do things. For example, in some cultures, people want to save face. This means they do not want to lose respect. In other cultures, people value making a good deal. If we know these values, we can do better in our talks.\n\nBefore we talk, we should know some things about the person we are talking to. This helps us do a good job in our talks.

            "The Bible says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is found in Psalm 14. Two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, discussed the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. We will assume both are correct about God for this discussion. This will help us compare their two ideas.\n\nSt. Anselm said we can know God exists by looking inside ourselves. He said we can't think of a time when God didn't exist. We know God exists because we know the truth inside our minds. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can know God exists through reason and evidence. We don't need faith to believe. Aquinas gave five logical reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and order. He said these reasons show that God is necessary. It's like a puzzle: if you see all the other pieces, you can know what the missing piece looks like.",
            "A long time ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince was born. This prince later became known as the Buddha. During his life, he left the world and became a wise man. His teachings started a new religion, called Buddhism. The most traditional part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is more than 2,500 years old. It is different now from when the Buddha was alive. We can see this in many places, for example in Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the 'water-cutting ceremony'. Monks and people who live in the community both participate in this ceremony. It has special meaning, even though the Buddha never taught about a holiday like this. The Theravada Buddhist community has to change its ideas over time. This happens because of internal and external forces. Internal forces come from inside the Buddhist group. External forces come from people who are not Buddhist. Some forces are good, some are bad. Some forces are friendly, some are not.\n\nWe need to know some special words. Internal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something that comes from people who are not Buddhist. Hostile means something that harms or wants to harm the Buddhist group. Benign means something that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, even if it might happen as a result. We will use these words many times in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to learn the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes three baskets of texts. The first basket has all the teachings of the Buddha. The second basket has rules for behavior. The third basket has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life has suffering, and everything is changing. To stop suffering and death, people need to understand these ideas. When people are enlightened, they will stop suffering and also stop wanting things they do not have and hating others. The Buddha taught rules for living. For people who live in the community, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave badly with others, and do not take alcohol. For monks, there are more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, our desires cause suffering. Third, we can overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries that had a long rivalry for 57 years. This lasted from 1836 to 1893. Their biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won the war and got Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. This was not the only fight between the two countries. They had many other smaller fights, but they stopped before World War One. \n\nThe rivalry started because of disagreements on important issues like religion, culture, and traditions. The two countries also had different economic interests. This is not unusual. Many countries that share a border have disagreements that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have had a long time of disagreements with a neighbor. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher said in 1977 that the United States has long-lasting problems with Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had disagreements because of their different religions. This is not a new problem. Many countries throughout history have had disagreements because of their religions. Sally Frahm said in 2001 that Americans used to be against Catholicism and monarchy. This was different from their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century. The disagreement between the United States and Mexico was similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, their disagreements were not about politics, but about their different religions. The United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 fights between the United States and Mexico between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from American towns near the border were a big problem until the United States and Mexico used their armies to control the border. \n\nSchmitt said that the rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to end when Mexico needed the United States more. The United States then changed its goals from taking territory to helping Mexico's economy in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I became a nurse because I wanted a steady job. People always get sick, so I thought it would be easy to find work. But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still sick today. I am 46 years old and have no money. I get help from the government, but it is not enough. Every day is hard for me. I am grateful for my family and friends who help me.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Bad things can happen to anyone. No matter how strong you are, you need help sometimes. \n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on the government. But I think we should help each other instead of trying to do everything alone. We should trust and help our neighbors.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" is not true. Our ancestors were able to survive hard times because they helped each other. They did not go through difficult times alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. Have a kit with food, water, and a first aid kit. But also get to know your neighbors. They can help you in an emergency.\n\nIf you have a farm, grow your own food. It is a good idea. But do not forget to help others too.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there rules that affect how they change? A long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain how living things are made using math. This is still true today.\n\nRecently, scientists have used math to study how mollusks grow their shells. We are doing a study to see if using math to understand how mollusks grow can help us learn about how they change over time.\n\nWe used special pictures of mollusks to find numbers that can help us make math models of their shells. We put these numbers into a computer program to make math models of what the shells could look like. We used these models to see how shells can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that turns around in a circle. It turns 360 degrees in all directions. The turns are called whorls. They are like circles that go around a middle point. The middle point is called the columella.\n\nThe whorls can grow at different speeds. A line that divides each whorl is called a suture. The last whorl is usually the biggest. The other whorls are called the spire.\n\nThe top of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the top of the shell and find where the first line is. We draw a line and count the whorls from there. We can count to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can draw a map of the path using numbers. We can use math to change the map and see how the shell grows.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much over the last ten years.  The country is doing well in meeting some of the United Nations' goals, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not improving fast enough in health care for children and mothers to meet its targets.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting more health workers at births.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled health worker.  But, these workers are not always doctors or nurses.  They are sometimes traditional workers like midwives.  These workers cannot give medical help if there are problems during pregnancy.  Many mothers die because of bleeding during childbirth.  The progress in this area is not as good as it seems.\n\nFewer children under five years old are treated for diarrhea by a health professional.  We do not have all the information about care after birth.  But we know that this is a problem.  The rates of care are low across the country.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a cesarean section, which is a medical operation to help the baby come out safely.  Only about 4% of women have cesarean sections.  The rate of cesarean sections is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  We also know that the poor have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, the poor get 27% fewer healthcare services than the rich.  This is because they have to pay out of their own money.\n\nTo improve the health care for babies and mothers, we need to find the best way to solve the problem.  One way is to focus on one area of health care at a time.  This can give us quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  It can take money away from other areas of health care.  It can also make it hard for people to work in other areas because there is not enough money.  Another problem is that when we have many programs working together, they can create too much paperwork and waste money.",
            "Victorian stories are known for their careful details and focus on the rich people of the time.  Two stories that are not like this are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These stories use mystery and strange events.  These things help us know the characters better and understand their feelings and ideas.\n\nIn one part of the story, Oliver Twist, Oliver's mind is full of confusing ideas. He is still thinking about two men, Sikes and Crackit, who are arguing. When he pays attention, he sees that he is talking to them. Then, there is a loud noise and he is moved away quickly. Oliver feels pain and is confused.\n\nThese stories use mystery in strange ways. In Oliver Twist, strange things happen and help us know about Oliver's feelings and the world around him. In one part, Oliver remembers a time when he was shot. He relives the memory like it was a dream. This shows that Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was very sick and did not know what was happening. The pain was always there, and he was very afraid.\n\nThis event makes us wonder who caused Oliver's bad luck. It was not Oliver's fault, so he had no control over what happened. This event also shows that Oliver is giving up. He has lost hope and does not try to change his situation.\n\nIn another part of the story, the author writes: \"The day was short. It was gone as soon as it came. The night was very quiet, but it did not last long.\"",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their schoolwork, but my best subjects were English and reading. One student, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I thought something was strange about his reading problems. Some letters he read well, others not. Adrian's family is from Latin America. He spoke very good English, but I thought he might have trouble with the alphabet.\n\nI met his mother when she came to pick him up from the after-school program. She did not speak English. I helped some with communication, but then I realized Adrian knew how to read. He just did not know the English alphabet very well.\n\nThis story shows us a problem in schools, especially in California. Even if a student speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We need to find a solution. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading helped. But for other students, it is more complicated.\n\nWe need to use many things to help students who do not speak much English. Some ideas are dual language classes, regular classes, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nDual language classes are a good idea. They help students who speak different languages. Children in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that these programs waste money and are not helpful. But that is not true. If we use these programs in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nWe do not need all teachers to be bilingual. That is too hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can assist teachers in the classroom.",
            "When we are young, many people tell us that there is something bigger than us. This thing is hard to understand. We can learn about it in Sunday school or other places of worship. Some people believe in the religions their parents teach them. Others do not believe. They think there is no more than what we can see and touch.\n\nA person's beliefs can change over time. This is because we grow and get new ideas. We try to find our own path in life. We want to understand the world and our place in it.\n\nMy father was sick for a long time. He had a disease that hurt him a lot. He got thinner and his hair fell out. One day, we sat on the porch together. It was raining hard. My father looked out into the rain. He looked sad. I was sad too. I did not want to talk about how much I would miss him. Talking about it would make it more painful.\n\nWe sat together, looking at the rain. I wanted to remember my father when he was happy, not when he was sick. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. My father did not want me to see him die. He would not want me to be sad.\n\nAfter my father died, I was very sad. I stayed in bed for three days. I waited for news from my family. But no one called me. I thought about God and why he would make my father suffer so much. I did not pray because I did not think God was listening.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new things. It has both old ideas and new ways of writing. Many people do not like it or do not understand it. Some think it is not deep. Others say it is great because it makes us feel the 'terrible sublime' (a big feeling of fear and wonder).\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was called \"The Castle of Otranto\". It was written by Horace Walpole. He took ideas from old romances and new novels to make a new way of writing. He used old ideas and new ways to create a new style. \n\nThe word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things before. People thought it was old-fashioned. But the Gothic Novel used these old ideas and made something new. It combined old and new in a way that made it popular for a long time.\n\nOne of the main ideas in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of being a brave, honorable, and kind knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto\", this idea is used to show what a true knight should be like. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show what was missing in society. He was unhappy with the state of the world and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past.\n\nIn the novel, a character named Frederic is a good example of a chivalric person. He is a prince who has suffered and is brave. He has many qualities of a true knight. He is kind and courteous. But, this image is also exaggerated, which is a common feature of Gothic Novels.",
            "Supply chain management is a process. It involves moving goods from customers to the raw materials stage, then to production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained the process of planning, doing, and controlling activities in a supply chain. He said this process helps meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain process. The production stage says when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows what customers need.\n\nManagers study the market and understand what customers want. Then they decide what to make and how much to make. Next, they decide where to make the products and choose a plant for good quality and high volume. They also think about customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter that, managers plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain process. Every detail matters. If details are not planned, it can cost a lot of time and money.\n\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. There is a plan for employee uniforms and receiving shipments. This plan makes the business work smoothly.\n\nSupply is the second key element. It means making decisions about a company's core skills and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for one product. Each division has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also decide to work with other companies to reduce costs.\n\nThe reason managers outsource work is to be fast and flexible. Being fast and flexible means giving good quality and low costs.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says that Hitler is living there.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a cardboard sign high above her head. The sign has a message written on it in black marker.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A long time ago, a group of military leaders took control of the country. They did not allow people to vote or speak freely. There were many protests in 2007. Many Burmese monks led the protests. The monks wore orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully. But soon, the situation became violent. Many people were hurt or killed. Foreign journalists were arrested and put in prison. One journalist from Japan was killed. The government said 13 people were killed. But a high-ranking military officer said many more people were killed. He said, \"Many people have died recently. The number of deaths is in the thousands.\"\n\nThis has happened many times in history. Long ago, some leaders thought they were gods and had complete control over their people. Today, some leaders try to keep people from speaking out against them. A long time ago, the Chinese government stopped a big protest at Tiananmen Square. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But another group said 2,000-3,000 people were killed.\n\nIn another country, Rwanda, a group of people began killing Tutsis and others they did not like. Many people were killed. A long time ago, a man named Hitler led a group that killed many Jews. His group was called the Third Reich.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He had a long career. This helped him make great music with his orchestra. He was good at writing music that showed each musician's skill. Ellington wrote music that allowed each musician to play freely. He also wrote music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington played piano in some of his music. But he was not the only musician. He made sure each musician had a special part in the music. This made the music sound new and exciting. Ellington's music was one of a kind. He was good at writing music that sounded good together.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. They say he used the human voice as a musical instrument. This is shown in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture to the music. He does not use words in this song. He uses the voice like an instrument.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. The first part has a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts smooth and then gets rough. The second part has a muted trumpet solo. The third part has a clarinet solo with a piano phrase. The fourth part is like the first part. The fifth part is the most exciting part. The reeds do the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections make a strong sound. The sixth part is like the first part. But the voice sounds different.\n\nIn the last part, the voice makes a growling sound. This is like a special effect. Ellington liked to use the voice in his music to add color and texture. This is one way he was different from other musicians.\n\nIn another song called Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music that sounds good together. He uses a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This makes a rich and exciting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone to introduce the melody. He chooses a musician who is good at playing the trombone.",
            "She felt something missing. This feeling started when she was 14. It continued three years later when she was 17. She thought she wanted a person, not just anything. But she did not like any boy. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same. She often thought about this strange feeling.\n\nHer life at home was usually quiet. Her parents were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. Her parents also rarely argued with her. They liked her to be independent. She was a happy person and her parents liked her.\n\nBut today was not a quiet day. She heard her mother scream in the kitchen. She ran into the room and said, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother was on the ground, in pain. She said \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter helped her mother and said, \"I will take you to the hospital.\" Her mother told her where to pick her up. Her daughter was happy she had taken classes to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and drove.\n\nThe hospital was a scary place. It smelled bad and made her worried. But she was not worried, only thinking about her mother. She carried her mother to the doctor and called for help. The doctors came and took care of her mother.\n\nHer mother fell off a little stool while getting a vase from high up.",
            "This study showed that eating like people in the Mediterranean area is good for your heart.  This way of eating is called the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet).  A higher \"aMed diet score\" means you eat more foods from plants and fish, and less meat and bad fats.  You can also have a little alcohol.\n\nPast studies showed that eating the Med diet can help you live longer and be healthier.  But these studies did not look at how it affects strokes.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old.  They were part of a bigger study of 121,700 women nurses in 11 US states.  The women answered questions about what they ate for 20 years.  Six times, they filled out a \"food frequency questionnaire\" to tell us what they ate.  Most of the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.  The food questionnaires were checked for accuracy.  When the women got heart disease or a stroke, the study checked medical records to confirm it. \n\nThe study looked at many things that could affect the results.  The study controlled for age, smoking, weight, hormone use, and exercise.  It also looked at how much the women drank and if they took aspirin.\n\nA computer program was used to see if eating like people in the Mediterranean area helps prevent heart disease and stroke.  The study found that women who ate like this had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study followed the women for 20 years.  In this time, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 women had a stroke, and 1077 women died from heart disease or stroke.  Women who ate the most like people in the Mediterranean area were less likely to get heart disease and stroke than women who ate the least like them.  The risk was 71% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States was in big financial trouble. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell. This is still happening today. We must ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it? \n\nThe financial crisis was caused by poor decisions made by leaders in government. They made banks give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened because the financial system was not ready for it. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people did not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. This caused big problems for the whole economy.\n\nThe start of the financial crisis was in 1999. President Clinton wanted to win a second term in office. He wanted to make more people happy with him. To do this, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people. This made it possible for the financial crisis to happen seven years later.\n\nA journalist named Steven Holmes wrote about the problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae was giving loans to people who could not afford them. He also said that this could cause a big problem if the economy slowed down.\n\nMany things worked together to make the financial crisis worse. New types of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used a lot. This made the economy depend too much on the housing market. People and banks borrowed too much money and were not prepared for a change in the housing market.\n\nThe housing market then crashed, and the banks that bought the bad loans were in trouble. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007. This is a lot of money. Some banks were sold cheaply, and others had to be regulated closely. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a bad thing in writing.  It is when you tell too much about a story.  Sometimes it makes readers bored or angry.  Dr. Merlin gets angry when she reads too much exposition.  It is like a bad devil that tells you to tell everything before you start the good parts.\n\nYou know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\"  Dr. Merlin still forgets this rule and writes long parts with nothing happening.  Exposition is when you tell the readers what happened.  In films, one character tells another a lot of information.  In writing, the author does the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says a woman meets a man, they get married, and he dies.  You don't want to read two pages about this.  You want to see how the man loves the woman and how she feels about him.  This makes you care about them and what happens to them.  You would want to know more about the man's character.  How does he talk and act?  How does the woman feel about him?  This helps you understand the story better.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add meat to the story.  You can't just say \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You need to make it interesting.  Sometimes it is hard to do this.  But you must try.  For example, you are introducing a new character.  You know he used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station.  You also know he is married, likes fishing and has a secret dream.  You don't need to tell all this at once.  You can show it through his actions and words.",
            "I watched two news programs on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live on NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. He is named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They only talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was hurt badly, but no one knew who shot him. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed before that when minorities are hurt, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is hurt, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot by a bullet from a small rifle. The police want you to call if you know who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot, but then it would rain. They wanted to make you stay tuned to the news to find out more.\n\nThey also told a story about a store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man, who was wearing a hood, robbed the store. They talked about how dark he was, which seemed unusual.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez from Texas. He was a big drug dealer. He was sent to prison for 25 years for selling marijuana. They also said he was a Hispanic man, but that was not important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and hard to break. It includes many feelings like love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see themselves. In bad situations, the true nature of this connection shows itself. It can be good or bad. When we understand these feelings, we must face the bad things that come with them. We see ourselves in our brother. We see our true character in our actions and the results of those actions.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey to the countryside. The author describes the land very well. Bitter disappointment and strong pride come together in a big scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows the readers how the brother with the disability feels through his actions and talks.\n\nThe brother's actions are all because of one main feeling: pride. From the start, the brother wants a brother who can do all the things he can do. He wants a brother to play with and to be friends with. But the little brother cannot do these things. He is very sick and cannot play like other children. The big brother is very angry and disappointed. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when the little brother smiles, he feels happy. This shows that the big brother loves his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and learn. As technology gets better, we use better words to describe the brain. In the past, we compared it to a flat piece of wax, then a piece of paper, and then a book. Now, we compare it to a computer.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These senses are like special helpers that take in things like touch, heat, sound, and light. They turn these things into special signals. The brain then changes these signals many times. This makes it easier to understand the information.\n\nWhen we look at something, the brain works in two ways. One way is from the bottom up. This means it takes small pieces of information and makes them into bigger pieces. For example, when we look at a black box on white paper, the brain uses small pieces of information like color and shape to decide that it is a box. The other way is from the top down. This means it uses what we already know to understand the information. This helps us learn things faster.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. This is like a choice. We don't notice small things like the blades of grass when we look at our shoes. But when we hear our name in a loud place, we listen carefully.\n\nThe brain has many steps to process information. It stores what we learn in different kinds of memory. There are three main kinds: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information. This means it changes the information into a way that the brain can understand. For example, if we hear a word, the brain can change it into how it sounds, how it looks, or what it means.\n\nThe brain also has to keep the information we learn. It does this by sending a special signal to the right neurons. Some studies on animals show that this signal helps us remember things for a short time. We keep long-term memories in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes what we know. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a web. Each idea is a node, and the nodes are connected to each other if they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in the book Brave New World. He is worried about how technology and a system called capitalism can hurt people. In this world, people put the community first and are taught to be happy all the time. But, the people are really just being controlled. They do not have a choice.\n\nThe people in this world are like pawns in a game. They are told what to think and believe. A person in charge, called the World Controller, makes all the decisions. \n\nIf we look at the book from a certain point of view called Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley does not like the way people are treated. He uses special words from this theory to show how he feels. For example, he talks about how people are the same and how they are changed into what they are meant to be.\n\nHuxley also criticizes capitalism. He says that people do not know the truth about how the system works. They are too busy thinking about their own happiness. The people in control make sure the common people do not know about the real problems. They control the people through a special sleep teaching method called hypnopædia. This makes people want to buy and spend money all the time.\n\nThe lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They do what they are told. The people in charge use a system called hegemony to control them. This means that one group of people has power over all the others. The upper classes know this, but they do not do anything to stop it. Only a few characters in the book, like Bernard, try to understand what is happening.\n\nThe people in Brave New World do not have real relationships. They do not know each other deeply. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's freedom to make choices and express themselves. The people in this world do not love each other or feel strong emotions. They only talk about physical things, like how someone looks.\n\nThe people in this world are happy to be where they are in the system. This shows how capitalism can make people obey and not question the system. This is what Marxist theory says about the people who work but do not have power.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years now. Getting around campus can be hard for many people. My first year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is far from the center of campus. To go to class in the Willard building, I had to walk a long way. It took up to 25 minutes to walk, especially when the weather is bad. Some time ago, the area near East Halls was empty land. The school built new sports fields and big buildings there. It is now full of apartments. As the campus grows, it is harder to get from one place to another. The best way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But just having a bike is not enough. Students and the school need to make sure the campus is safe for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding a bike again. He said it is a great way to travel. He said it was not cool to ride a bike for a few years, but now it is the best way to get around. Riding a bike is good for your body and it is fast. You can go 30 miles or more with just eating a simple meal and exercising a little. I live off campus now, which is far from the center of campus. I decided to buy a bike and it was the best decision I made this year. It takes 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas building. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. I have to be careful because Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also good, but I am too busy. If I did not have my bike, I would have to walk to class every day. It would take 30-40 minutes extra every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have time for that."
